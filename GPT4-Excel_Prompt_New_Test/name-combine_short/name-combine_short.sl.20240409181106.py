Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Summary for Input Column Data:

The input data consists of two columns, each containing a series of first names and last names, respectively. The first names vary widely in origin and phonetic structure, suggesting a diverse set of backgrounds or ethnicities. Names like "Launa," "Lakenya," "Brendan," "Bradford," "Rudolf," and "Lara" indicate a mix of cultural influences, from more traditional Anglo-Saxon or European to possibly African or unique modern American naming conventions. The last names, such as "Withers," "Edison," "Hage," "Lango," "Akiyama," and "Constable," also display a broad spectrum of origins, including English, possibly Scandinavian, Japanese, and others that could be of British or occupational origin. This diversity in both columns suggests a collection of names that could belong to individuals from various parts of the world, reflecting a global or multicultural context.

### Summary for Output Column Data:

The output data combines the first and last names from the input columns into full names, presented in a standard Western naming convention of "First Name Last Name." This transformation from separate entities into a single entity represents a common practice in many cultures for identifying individuals in both formal and informal contexts. The output retains the diversity and multicultural essence of the input data, now presented as complete identifiers for each hypothetical individual. The combination of names in the output column does not alter the phonetic or cultural characteristics of the names but serves to provide a more complete picture of each individual's identity as typically recognized in social, professional, or legal settings.

### Relationship Summary:

The relationship between the input and output data is a straightforward process of concatenation, where two separate pieces of qualitative data (first name and last name) are combined to form a single piece of qualitative data (full name). This process reflects a common societal practice of using full names as a standard method of identification. The transformation does not change the inherent characteristics of the names but rather presents them in a format that is widely recognized and used for individual identification. The diversity observed in the input columns is preserved in the output, highlighting the multicultural aspect of the data set. This relationship underscores the importance of names in conveying personal identity and cultural background in a format that is universally applicable and recognizable., and input as ['Launa', 'Withers'] output is Launa Withers, input as ['Lakenya', 'Edison'] output is Lakenya Edison, input as ['Brendan', 'Hage'] output is Brendan Hage, input as ['Bradford', 'Lango'] output is Bradford Lango, input as ['Rudolf', 'Akiyama'] output is Rudolf Akiyama, input as ['Lara', 'Constable'] output is Lara Constable, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.

    This function takes two arguments: first_name and last_name.
    It concatenates these two strings with a space between them to form a full name.
    
    Parameters:
    first_name (str): The first name of an individual.
    last_name (str): The last name of an individual.
