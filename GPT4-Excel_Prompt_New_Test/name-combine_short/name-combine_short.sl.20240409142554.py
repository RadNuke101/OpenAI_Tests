Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Summary for Input Column Data:

The input data consists of two columns, each containing a series of first names and last names, respectively. The first names vary widely in origin and phonetic style, indicating a diverse set of individuals. Names like "Launa," "Lakenya," "Brendan," "Bradford," "Rudolf," and "Lara" showcase a range of cultural backgrounds and naming conventions. Similarly, the last names such as "Withers," "Edison," "Hage," "Lango," "Akiyama," and "Constable" reflect a variety of ancestries and linguistic roots. The diversity in both columns suggests that the dataset encompasses a broad spectrum of identities, without any apparent bias towards a particular gender, ethnicity, or culture. The first column is consistent in providing singular first names, while the second column does the same for last names, maintaining a clear distinction between given names and surnames.

### Summary for Output Column Data:

The output data combines the two input columns into full names, presented in the format "FirstName LastName". This transformation from separate entities into a singular, cohesive identity is consistent across all examples provided. The output maintains the integrity of the original data, ensuring that the cultural and phonetic characteristics of each name are preserved. The process of combining the names does not alter the original input beyond merging them, indicating a straightforward concatenation operation without modification to the individual names. This results in a list of complete names that are ready for use in contexts where a full name is required, such as in formal documentation, identification, or communication purposes.

### Relationship Between Input and Output:

The relationship between the input columns and the output column is a direct and linear transformation, where the first and last names provided as separate entities are merged to form complete names. This process is uniform across all instances, suggesting a standardized method of name concatenation. The transformation respects the original data's integrity, with no additions, deletions, or alterations to the names themselves, aside from the necessary space inserted between the first and last names to ensure proper formatting. This method of data processing highlights the importance of maintaining the authenticity and accuracy of personal names, especially in contexts where precise identification is crucial. The relationship underscores a fundamental aspect of data handling: the ability to reconfigure individual data points into a format that serves a specific purpose, in this case, the presentation of full names for clarity and completeness., and input as ['Launa', 'Withers'] output is Launa Withers, input as ['Lakenya', 'Edison'] output is Lakenya Edison, input as ['Brendan', 'Hage'] output is Brendan Hage, input as ['Bradford', 'Lango'] output is Bradford Lango, input as ['Rudolf', 'Akiyama'] output is Rudolf Akiyama, input as ['Lara', 'Constable'] output is Lara Constable, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
