Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Input Column Summary:

The input data consists of two distinct parts. The first part is a string that describes an action, specifically mentioning "replies to" followed by a list of usernames (e.g., _aya, _tasisuke, and _chan). These usernames are prefixed with an underscore, indicating a specific naming convention or identifier for the users involved in the context. The second part of the input is a numerical string that represents a certain quantity or level, which is likely to influence the outcome or output in some manner. The numerical string varies across the dataset, indicating different scenarios or conditions under which the action described in the first part of the input is performed.

### Output Column Summary:

The output data is numerical and appears to correlate with the second part of the input data, which is the numerical string indicating a quantity or level. The values in the output column increase as the numerical string in the input increases, suggesting a direct relationship between the input's numerical value and the output. The output values are not linearly increasing, indicating that the relationship between the input quantity and the output might be governed by a more complex rule or formula rather than a simple linear equation.

### Relationship Summary:

The relationship between the input and the output data suggests that the action of "replies to" a specified list of users, when combined with the numerical string in the input, influences the numerical outcome in the output. The specific numerical string in the input seems to act as a multiplier or a key factor that modifies the base scenario described by the action of replying to the users. The increase in the numerical string leads to a higher output value, but the rate of increase is not constant, implying a non-linear relationship. This could mean that the numerical string in the input could represent a complexity level, intensity, or some form of weighting that affects the outcome in a non-linear fashion. The exact nature of this relationship is not clear from the data provided but indicates a systematic approach to calculating the output based on the described action and the associated numerical level or quantity in the input., and input as ['replies to _aya, _tasisuke, and _chan', '1'] output is 12, input as ['replies to _aya, _tasisuke, and _chan', '2'] output is 18, input as ['replies to _aya, _tasisuke, and _chan', '3'] output is 33, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
