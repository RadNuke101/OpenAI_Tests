Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Summary for Input Column Data:

The input data consists of textual instructions or requests that involve actions related to communication or support services. These instructions are directed towards specific entities identified by their unique identifiers, which resemble email addresses or domain names. The nature of the instructions varies but generally includes actions such as sending emails or contacting for support. The entities to be contacted are embedded within these instructions, indicating a direct relationship between the action to be taken and the entity involved.

### Summary for Output Column Data:

The output data extracts and isolates the unique identifiers (resembling email addresses or domain names) from the input instructions. These identifiers represent the specific targets or recipients for the actions mentioned in the input data. The output simplifies the input by focusing solely on these identifiers, stripping away the surrounding instructional text and leaving only the essential information needed to identify the entity involved in the communication or support action.

### Relationship Summary:

The relationship between the input and output data is a process of extraction and simplification, where the output distills the essential information (the unique identifiers) from the more complex instructions provided in the input. This process highlights the key entities involved in the actions described by the input, making it easier to understand who the intended recipients of the actions are. The output serves as a direct link or reference point to the entities that are the focus of the input instructions, facilitating actions like sending emails or contacting support by providing a clear and concise identifier for each entity., and input as ['send email to json_acme.com'] output is json_acme.com, input as ['contact help_robot.com for all support requests'] output is help_robot.com, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
