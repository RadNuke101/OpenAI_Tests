Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Input Column Summary:

The input data exhibits a variety of formats, including numerical values with and without decimal points, and some entries are prefixed with a special character combination "-%". This diversity suggests that the input data is not strictly numerical but also contains formatting characters that might indicate specific conditions or categories. The presence of both positive numbers (e.g., '500', '5.125') and what appears to be negative or special-case numbers (e.g., '-%134', '-%43.00') indicates a mix of standard and possibly conditionally formatted entries. The data is qualitative in nature due to the inclusion of non-numeric characters that carry specific meanings or implications beyond mere value.

### Output Column Summary:

The output data retains the numerical values from the input data but modifies the format by either removing or transforming the prefix characters. Specifically, the "-%" prefix is removed or transformed, resulting in the percentage symbol "%" being placed directly before the number without any intervening characters. This transformation suggests a normalization process where the input data, regardless of its initial format (plain number, number with decimal, or special prefixed format), is converted into a more uniform format. The output retains the numerical precision of the input (e.g., decimal points are preserved), indicating that the transformation process respects the original numerical value and its specificity.

### Relationship Between Input and Output:

The transformation from input to output reveals a process aimed at standardizing the format of the data while preserving its numerical integrity. The removal or alteration of prefix characters in the output suggests that the transformation process is designed to highlight or emphasize certain aspects of the data, such as converting it into a percentage format where applicable. This could imply that the original input data contains special formatting to denote different conditions or categories (e.g., "-%" could imply a negative condition or a special case that needs to be converted into a more neutral or standardized format for further analysis or presentation).

The relationship between input and output underscores a qualitative data processing approach, where the goal is to refine or adjust the data's format for consistency, readability, or compliance with a specific data presentation standard. This process does not alter the fundamental numerical value of the data but rather its presentation or categorization, making it easier to interpret or analyze in subsequent stages., and input as ['-%134'] output is %134, input as ['500'] output is 500, input as ['5.125'] output is 5.125, input as ['-%43.00'] output is %43.00, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
