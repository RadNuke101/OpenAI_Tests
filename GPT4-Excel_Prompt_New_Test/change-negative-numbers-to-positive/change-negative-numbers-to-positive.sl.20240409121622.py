Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Input Column Summary:

The input data exhibits a variety of formats, including numeric values, percentages, and potentially negative values. These inputs are presented as strings, indicated by their encapsulation in quotes (e.g., '500', '-%134'). The data can be categorized into several distinct formats based on their characteristics:

1. **Plain Numeric Values**: These are straightforward numeric representations without any additional symbols except for the decimal point in some cases (e.g., '500', '5.125'). They represent either whole numbers or floating-point numbers.

2. **Percentage Values**: Some inputs are denoted with a percentage symbol ('%'), either preceding or following a numeric value (e.g., '-%134', '%43.00'). This symbol could indicate a special categorization or a different interpretation of the numeric value it accompanies.

3. **Negative Values**: The presence of a minus sign ('-') in some inputs suggests the representation of negative values. However, the placement of this sign, especially when combined with the percentage symbol (e.g., '-%134'), adds complexity to interpreting the value's intended meaning.

4. **Formatting Variations**: Inputs show variations in formatting, such as the inclusion of decimal points and leading zeros in percentage values (e.g., '%43.00'). This variation indicates a non-uniform approach to data entry or representation.

### Output Column Summary:

The output data retains the numeric and percentage values from the input but exhibits a consistent transformation pattern across all examples:

1. **Removal of Negative Signs**: Negative signs ('-') present in the input are removed in the output, suggesting a process that either disregards the sign or interprets it in a specific way that does not affect the output.

2. **Retention of Numeric and Percentage Values**: The numeric value, whether it is a whole number, floating-point, or percentage, is preserved in the output. This indicates that the transformation process focuses on the format rather than altering the numeric value itself.

3. **Consistent Formatting**: The output data appears to standardize the format by removing any signs of negativity while keeping the percentage symbol and the numeric value intact. This suggests an emphasis on maintaining the essential information while discarding certain formatting elements.

### Relationship Between Input and Output:

The transformation from input to output demonstrates a process aimed at standardizing the data presentation while preserving the core numeric and percentage information. The key aspects of this relationship include:

- **Negativity Handling**: The process effectively neutralizes negative representations, possibly to standardize data analysis or presentation, suggesting that the negativity is either not relevant to the subsequent analysis or is interpreted in a specific context that does not require explicit negative signs.

- **Preservation of Value Types**: Both numeric and percentage values are preserved, indicating that the essence of the data (i.e., its quantitative aspect) is crucial for its intended use or analysis.

- **Standardization of Format**: By removing negative signs and potentially other formatting inconsistencies (though not explicitly shown in the examples), the process aims to create a uniform data set. This could facilitate easier comparison, aggregation, or further processing of the data.

In summary, the relationship between the input and output data highlights a transformation process focused on format standardization and the preservation of essential quantitative information, potentially to support specific analytical or presentation needs., and input as ['-%134'] output is %134, input as ['500'] output is 500, input as ['5.125'] output is 5.125, input as ['-%43.00'] output is %43.00, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
