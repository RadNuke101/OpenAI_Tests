Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Input Column Summary:

1. **First Column (String Patterns):** The first column contains strings that appear to be patterns or sequences of characters, possibly representing some form of structured data. For example, '100x15x50' and 'cat-in-the-hat' suggest a mix of alphanumeric characters and delimiters (like 'x' and '-') used to separate different parts of the data.

2. **Second Column (Delimiter):** The second column specifies a single character that seems to act as a delimiter within the patterns provided in the first column. For instance, 'x' is used to separate numbers in '100x15x50', and '-' is used in 'cat-in-the-hat'. This suggests that the character in the second column is used to identify or isolate segments within the strings of the first column.

3. **Third Column (Position):** The third column contains numbers (e.g., '2', '3') that appear to represent a position or an order within the structure defined by the first two columns. This could indicate an instruction to extract or manipulate data based on the position relative to the delimiters identified in the second column.

### Output Column Summary:

The output column contains numbers (e.g., '7', '11') that seem to represent a result or outcome derived from applying some form of operation or rule to the data described in the input columns. The nature of these numbers suggests they are quantitative outcomes of a qualitative process applied to the input data.

### Relationship Summary:

The relationship between the input columns and the output column appears to be a function of counting or extracting information based on the structured patterns provided in the first column, the delimiter specified in the second column, and the position or order indicated in the third column. Specifically, the process seems to involve:

1. **Identifying Segments:** Using the delimiter from the second column to segment or divide the pattern in the first column into distinct parts.
2. **Applying Position:** Utilizing the number in the third column to target a specific segment or characteristic of the segmented pattern.
3. **Generating Output:** The output number reflects a quantitative measure or characteristic of the targeted segment or the result of an operation applied to it. This could involve counting characters, identifying the length of a segment, or some other form of measurement related to the structure and content of the initial pattern.

In summary, the relationship between the input and output suggests a systematic approach to dissecting and analyzing structured patterns based on predefined rules involving delimiters and positional instructions, resulting in a quantitative assessment or measurement of specific aspects of those patterns., and input as ['100x15x50', 'x', '2'] output is 7, input as ['cat-in-the-hat', '-', '3'] output is 11, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
