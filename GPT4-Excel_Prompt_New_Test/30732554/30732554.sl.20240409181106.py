Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Summary for Input Column Data:

The input data consists of strings that appear to represent some form of identification codes or part numbers, possibly related to inventory items, tools, or components. These strings are structured in a way that typically starts with an alphabetical prefix (e.g., "TL", "CT"), followed by a hyphen, and then a series of numbers which vary in length. In some cases, additional information is appended to the identification code, separated by a vertical bar "|". This additional information can include measurements (e.g., "10MM"), codes (e.g., "76DK"), or it might be absent, as seen in the example "CT-576". There is also a possibility of encountering a placeholder or non-applicable marker such as "N/A", indicating that the specific entry does not have an applicable code or is intentionally left blank.

### Summary for Output Column:

The output data retains the core identification code or part number from the input data but excludes any additional information that might have been appended after the vertical bar "|". This process simplifies the data to its essential identifier, removing any extra details or specifications that were initially attached. The output maintains the format of an alphabetical prefix followed by a hyphen and a series of numbers. In cases where the input is a placeholder like "N/A", the output remains unchanged, indicating that the process respects entries that are marked as non-applicable or placeholders.

### Relationship Between Input and Output:

The transformation from input to output data involves a simplification or normalization process where the primary focus is on preserving the essential identification codes while discarding any supplementary information. This process suggests that the purpose of the output data is to standardize or streamline the identification codes for further processing, analysis, or cataloging, where the additional details are either not required or are handled separately. The consistent preservation of the core identifier across all entries, regardless of the presence or absence of extra information in the input, indicates a systematic approach to extracting the most relevant part of the data for specific applications or databases that rely on these simplified identifiers., and input as ['TL-18273982| 10MM'] output is TL-18273982, input as ['TL-288762| 76DK'] output is TL-288762, input as ['CT-576'] output is CT-576, input as ['N/A'] output is N/A, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
