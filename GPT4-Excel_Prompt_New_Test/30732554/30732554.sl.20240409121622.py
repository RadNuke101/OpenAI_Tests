Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Input Column Summary:

The input data consists of strings that appear to represent some form of identification codes or part numbers, possibly related to inventory, equipment, or a cataloging system. These strings are structured in a way that suggests a prefix (which could be an abbreviation or a category indicator) followed by a hyphen and a sequence of numbers. In some instances, additional information is appended to the identification code, separated by a vertical bar (`|`). This additional information varies in format, including numerical values followed by alphabetic characters (e.g., `10MM`, `76DK`), indicating that it might specify dimensions, models, or other specifications relevant to the item or category represented by the code. The presence of an entry labeled `N/A` suggests that the dataset may include items or records for which the relevant information is not applicable or not available.

### Output Column Summary:

The output data retains the core identification or part numbers from the input data but omits any additional information that was appended in the input. This simplification process results in a cleaner, more standardized set of codes that likely serve as a unique identifier for each item or record without the extra specifications or details. The output data maintains the structure of a prefix followed by a hyphen and a sequence of numbers, ensuring consistency across entries. The inclusion of `N/A` in the output indicates that the process for simplifying the input data accommodates entries that do not conform to the standard format, treating them as valid identifiers in their own right.

### Relationship Between Input and Output:

The transformation from input to output data involves extracting the primary identification or part number from a potentially more complex string that includes additional specifications or details. This process suggests a focus on standardizing the data for purposes where only the unique identifier is necessary, possibly for indexing, cross-referencing, or simplifying database entries. The relationship between the input and output data highlights a filtration or reduction step designed to distill essential identification information from a more detailed or specific context provided in the input. This could be particularly useful in scenarios where the primary concern is the identification of items or records, and the additional specifications are either irrelevant or handled separately in a different context or database field., and input as ['TL-18273982| 10MM'] output is TL-18273982, input as ['TL-288762| 76DK'] output is TL-288762, input as ['CT-576'] output is CT-576, input as ['N/A'] output is N/A, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
