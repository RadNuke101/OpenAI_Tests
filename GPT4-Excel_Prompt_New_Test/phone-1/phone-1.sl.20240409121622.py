Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Based on the provided data, we can observe a clear pattern in the relationship between the input and the output. The input data is structured in a consistent format, where each entry is a string of numbers divided into three segments by hyphens (e.g., 'XXX-YYY-ZZZ'). The output data is extracted directly from the middle segment of each input string.

### Input Column Summary:
- The input consists of strings formatted as 'XXX-YYY-ZZZ', where XXX, YYY, and ZZZ are three-digit numbers.
- Each input string is unique in this dataset.
- The input strings are structured in a way that allows for the extraction of specific segments, indicating a patterned approach to the data.

### Output Column Summary:
- The output is always the middle segment (YYY) of the input string.
- The output numbers range from three-digit integers, specifically extracted from the input.
- Each output is directly related to its corresponding input, showing a deterministic extraction process.

### Relationship Summary:
The relationship between the input and output columns is straightforward and deterministic. The output is always derived from the input by selecting the middle segment of numbers. This indicates that the process for generating the output from the input is based on a fixed pattern of extraction, focusing on the segmentation of the input strings. There is no transformation or computation applied to the numbers themselves; the output is simply a portion of the input data, specifically the middle section of the structured string. This pattern suggests a qualitative relationship where the significance of the numbers (beyond their position in the string) is not considered in the extraction process., and input as ['938-242-504'] output is 242, input as ['308-916-545'] output is 916, input as ['623-599-749'] output is 599, input as ['981-424-843'] output is 424, input as ['118-980-214'] output is 980, input as ['244-655-094'] output is 655, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
