'''
Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: return the number of characters in the inputted expression, and input as ['The'] output is 3, input as ['The quick fox'] output is 13, input as ['The quick  fox'] output is 14, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.

# Test cases based on the prompt
print(generated_function('The'))  # Expected output: 3

print(generated_function('The quick  fox'))  # Expected output: 14
print(generated_function("The"))  ## Output: 3
print(generated_function("The quick fox"))  ## Output: 13
