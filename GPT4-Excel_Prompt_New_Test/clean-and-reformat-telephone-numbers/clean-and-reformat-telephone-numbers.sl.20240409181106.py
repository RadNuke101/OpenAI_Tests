Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Input Column Summary:

The input column consists of phone numbers presented in various formats. These formats include differences in separators (such as dashes "-", dots ".", and spaces " "), and some numbers are enclosed within symbols like parentheses "()" or angle brackets "<>". Despite these variations in presentation, each entry represents a valid phone number. The formats observed in the input data suggest a diversity in stylistic representation, possibly reflecting different regional standards, personal preferences, or data entry conventions. The input data is qualitative, emphasizing the format and presentation of phone numbers rather than their numerical value.

### Output Column Summary:

The output column standardizes the format of the phone numbers provided in the input column by removing all non-numeric characters, including spaces, dashes, dots, and any enclosing symbols like parentheses or angle brackets. The result is a clean, uniform sequence of digits for each phone number, facilitating easier processing, comparison, and storage in databases or contact lists. This transformation emphasizes the utility of having a consistent data format, particularly for applications that require numerical analysis or integration with telecommunication systems.

### Relationship Between Input and Output:

The relationship between the input and output columns illustrates a process of normalization and standardization of phone numbers from various stylistic representations to a uniform numeric format. This transformation process is crucial for data cleaning and preparation, especially in contexts where phone numbers from diverse sources need to be aggregated, analyzed, or used in automated calling or messaging systems. By stripping away non-numeric characters and standardizing the format, the process ensures that the essential information—the phone number itself—is preserved and made more accessible for subsequent operations. This relationship underscores the importance of data preprocessing in enhancing the usability and interoperability of qualitative data., and input as ['801-456-8765'] output is 8014568765, input as ['<978> 654-0299'] output is 9786540299, input as ['978.654.0299'] output is 9786540299, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
