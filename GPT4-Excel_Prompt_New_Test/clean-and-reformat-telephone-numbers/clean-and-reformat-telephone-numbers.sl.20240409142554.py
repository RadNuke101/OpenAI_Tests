Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Summary for Input Column Data

The input data consists of phone numbers presented in various formats. These formats include differences in separators (such as dashes "-", dots ".", and angle brackets "<>"), and the presence or absence of spaces. Each entry represents a unique phone number, formatted according to different conventional or personal preferences. The variations in the formatting suggest a lack of standardization in the input data, reflecting the diverse ways individuals or systems might record or display phone numbers. Despite these differences in presentation, each input retains a consistent structure: a three-part numerical sequence typically representing area code, local exchange, and subscriber number.

### Summary for Output Column Data

The output data standardizes the diverse input formats into a uniform representation of phone numbers. Each output is a continuous string of digits without any separators or spaces, effectively stripping away any formatting to present the phone number in its most basic numerical form. This transformation facilitates easier processing and analysis of the phone numbers, as it removes the variability introduced by different formatting preferences. The output retains the essential information (the numerical sequence of the phone number) while discarding non-essential formatting details.

### Relationship Between Input and Output

The transformation from input to output demonstrates a process of standardization and simplification. The relationship between the two highlights a methodical removal of formatting elements to achieve a uniform representation of phone numbers. This process does not alter the intrinsic numerical value or sequence of the phone numbers; instead, it focuses on removing extraneous characters (such as dashes, dots, and brackets) and spaces that do not contribute to the essential information. The purpose of this transformation is to facilitate easier handling, comparison, and analysis of the phone numbers by converting them into a consistent format. This standardization is particularly useful in contexts where phone numbers from various sources need to be aggregated, compared, or processed without the complications introduced by differing formats., and input as ['801-456-8765'] output is 8014568765, input as ['<978> 654-0299'] output is 9786540299, input as ['978.654.0299'] output is 9786540299, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
