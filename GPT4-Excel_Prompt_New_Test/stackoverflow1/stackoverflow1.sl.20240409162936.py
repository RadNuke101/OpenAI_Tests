Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Summary for Input Column Data:

The input data consists of company names that are primarily in the trucking industry. These names are structured in a way that includes the core name of the company followed by a legal or descriptive suffix such as "Inc.", "Inc", or "LLC". The names vary in length, indicating that companies of different sizes and possibly different scopes of operations within the trucking industry are represented. The presence of terms like "Trucking" and "Truck" within the names strongly suggests a focus on transportation, logistics, or freight services. The variety in naming conventions (e.g., the use of abbreviations, the inclusion of descriptive terms before "Truck" or "Trucking") implies a diversity in branding strategies among these entities.

### Summary for Output Column Data:

The output data retains the core names of the companies while removing legal or descriptive suffixes such as "Inc.", "Inc", and "LLC". This process streamlines the company names to their essential identifiers, focusing on the part of the name that likely holds the most brand recognition and relevance to their primary business operations. The removal of these suffixes simplifies the names, making them more straightforward and potentially more memorable. The output data, therefore, represents a distilled version of the company identities, emphasizing their operational focus (trucking or related services) without the formalities of corporate structure indicators.

### Relationship Summary Between Input and Output Data:

The transformation from input to output data demonstrates a process of simplification and focus. By stripping away the legal and descriptive suffixes from the company names, the output highlights the core identity and operational focus of each entity. This process suggests an underlying assumption that the essence of each company's brand and market presence is captured more by the unique or descriptive part of its name rather than the generic corporate structure indicators. The relationship between the input and output data underscores a prioritization of clarity and brand identity over formal corporate nomenclature. This could be particularly relevant in contexts where quick recognition and recall of a company's name are more valuable than understanding its legal status or structure, such as marketing, branding, or customer-facing communications., and input as ['Trucking Inc.'] output is Trucking, input as ['New Truck Inc'] output is New Truck, input as ['ABV Trucking Inc, LLC'] output is ABV Trucking, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
