Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Input Column Summary:

The input data column consists of company names that are primarily in the trucking industry. These names are presented in a formal structure, often including legal identifiers such as "Inc." or "LLC" at the end. The names vary in length and complexity, ranging from simple, straightforward names to more complex ones that may include abbreviations or multiple words before the legal identifiers. The common theme across all entries is their association with the trucking business, indicated either explicitly through the word "Trucking" or implicitly through the context of the names. The presence of legal identifiers like "Inc." or "LLC" suggests these are formal business entities recognized as such in legal jurisdictions.

### Output Column Summary:

The output data column simplifies the input company names by removing legal identifiers such as "Inc." or "LLC" and retaining the core name of the company, which often includes the word "Trucking" if it was present in the input. The output focuses on the more descriptive part of the company names, emphasizing the brand or the primary business identifier without the formal legal structure indicators. This simplification process results in cleaner, more straightforward names that are easier to recognize and remember, focusing on the essence of the company's identity rather than its legal status.

### Relationship Between Input and Output:

The transformation from the input to the output column represents a process of simplification and clarification, where the essence of each company's identity is distilled by removing legal terminologies. This process highlights the core business or brand name, making it more accessible and easier to understand at a glance. The relationship between the input and output columns is characterized by a consistent method of trimming and focusing on the key elements of the company names that convey their primary business or brand identity. This transformation is beneficial for contexts where the legal form of the company is less relevant than the brand or business name itself, such as in marketing materials, informal communications, or when creating a more user-friendly database of company names in the trucking industry., and input as ['Trucking Inc.'] output is Trucking, input as ['New Truck Inc'] output is New Truck, input as ['ABV Trucking Inc, LLC'] output is ABV Trucking, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
