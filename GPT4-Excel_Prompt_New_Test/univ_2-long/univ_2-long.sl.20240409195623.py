Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Input Column Summary:

The input data consists of two distinct columns, each containing specific pieces of information about various universities and colleges across the United States. The first column lists the names of the institutions, which include a mix of well-known universities (such as "University of Pennsylvania", "UCLA", "Cornell University", "MIT", "Harvard University") and other educational entities. These names range from formal titles ("University of Michigan") to more colloquial or abbreviated forms ("Penn", "NYU", "UIUC"). The second column provides the geographical location of each institution, including the city and state. In some instances, the country ("USA") is also included, while in others, it is omitted, leaving just the city and state abbreviation.

### Output Column Summary:

The output data consolidates the information provided in the two input columns into a single, cohesive format. Each output entry combines the name of the institution with its geographical location, presented as a single string. The format consistently follows the pattern of "Institution Name, City, State, Country". When the country is not explicitly mentioned in the input, "USA" is automatically appended to the output, ensuring uniformity across all entries. This standardized format facilitates easier recognition and categorization of the institutions based on their names and locations, providing a clear and concise representation of each entity's identity and geographical context.

### Relationship Between Input and Output:

The transformation from input to output demonstrates a process of standardization and completeness. The input data, while informative, is somewhat fragmented and inconsistent in terms of geographical detail (specifically, the inclusion or exclusion of the country). The output data addresses these inconsistencies by adopting a uniform format that not only combines the institution's name and location into a single string but also ensures that the country ("USA") is consistently included, even when it was missing from the original input. This process enhances the clarity and utility of the information, making it more accessible and comprehensible for users who may need to quickly identify the location of a specific institution or compare institutions based on their geographical settings. The relationship between the input and output underscores the value of data standardization, particularly in contexts where geographical consistency and completeness are important., and input as ['University of Pennsylvania', 'Phialdelphia, PA, USA'] output is University of Pennsylvania, Phialdelphia, PA, USA, input as ['UCLA', 'Los Angeles, CA'] output is UCLA, Los Angeles, CA, USA, input as ['Cornell University', 'Ithaca, New York, USA'] output is Cornell University, Ithaca, New York, USA, input as ['Penn', 'Philadelphia, PA, USA'] output is Penn, Philadelphia, PA, USA, input as ['University of Maryland College Park', 'College Park, MD'] output is University of Maryland College Park, College Park, MD, USA, input as ['University of Michigan', 'Ann Arbor, MI, USA'] output is University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA, input as ['UC Berkeley', 'Berkeley, CA'] output is UC Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA, input as ['MIT', 'Cambridge, MA'] output is MIT, Cambridge, MA, USA, input as ['Rice University', 'Houston, TX'] output is Rice University, Houston, TX, USA, input as ['Yale University', 'New Haven, CT, USA'] output is Yale University, New Haven, CT, USA, input as ['Columbia University', 'New York, NY, USA'] output is Columbia University, New York, NY, USA, input as ['NYU', 'New York, New York, USA'] output is NYU, New York, New York, USA, input as ['UC Berkeley', 'Berkeley, CA'] output is UC Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA, input as ['UIUC', 'Urbana, IL'] output is UIUC, Urbana, IL, USA, input as ['Temple University', 'Philadelphia, PA'] output is Temple University, Philadelphia, PA, USA, input as ['Harvard University', 'Cambridge, MA, USA'] output is Harvard University, Cambridge, MA, USA, input as ['University of Connecticut', 'Storrs, CT, USA'] output is University of Connecticut, Storrs, CT, USA, input as ['Drexel University', 'Philadelphia, PA'] output is Drexel University, Philadelphia, PA, USA, input as ['New Haven University', 'New Haven, CT, USA'] output is New Haven University, New Haven, CT, USA, input as ['University of California, Santa Barbara', 'Santa Barbara, CA, USA'] output is University of California, Santa Barbara, Santa Barbara, CA, USA, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
