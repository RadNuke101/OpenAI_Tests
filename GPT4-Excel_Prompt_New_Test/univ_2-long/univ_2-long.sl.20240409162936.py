Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Input Column Summary:

The input data consists of two columns, with each row representing a specific university or college and its corresponding location within the United States. The first column contains the name of the institution, which varies from well-known public and private universities (e.g., "University of Pennsylvania", "UCLA", "Cornell University") to more specialized or less universally recognized institutions (e.g., "New Haven University", "Drexel University"). The second column provides the geographical location of each institution, including the city and state. In some instances, the country "USA" is also included, while in others, it is omitted. This variation suggests a lack of uniformity in how location data is presented.

### Output Column Summary:

The output data consolidates the information from the two input columns into a single string for each institution, following a consistent format: "Institution Name, City, State, USA". If the original input already included "USA" in the location, it is retained in the output. For entries where "USA" was initially omitted, it is appended to ensure uniformity across all entries. This standardization process highlights a key relationship between the input and output: the transformation aims to provide a complete and consistent representation of each institution's name and location by ensuring that the country is explicitly mentioned, even if it was not included in the original input.

### Relationship Summary:

The transformation from input to output demonstrates a process of standardization and completeness. The original input, which varies in the level of detail provided (particularly regarding the inclusion of "USA" in the location), is converted into a uniform format that explicitly includes the institution's name, city, state, and country. This process ensures that each entry in the output column provides a comprehensive and consistent identification of the institution's geographical location, making it clear that all listed institutions are located in the United States. This uniformity is crucial for clarity, especially in contexts where the data might be shared with an international audience or used in comparative analyses involving institutions from multiple countries., and input as ['University of Pennsylvania', 'Phialdelphia, PA, USA'] output is University of Pennsylvania, Phialdelphia, PA, USA, input as ['UCLA', 'Los Angeles, CA'] output is UCLA, Los Angeles, CA, USA, input as ['Cornell University', 'Ithaca, New York, USA'] output is Cornell University, Ithaca, New York, USA, input as ['Penn', 'Philadelphia, PA, USA'] output is Penn, Philadelphia, PA, USA, input as ['University of Maryland College Park', 'College Park, MD'] output is University of Maryland College Park, College Park, MD, USA, input as ['University of Michigan', 'Ann Arbor, MI, USA'] output is University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA, input as ['UC Berkeley', 'Berkeley, CA'] output is UC Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA, input as ['MIT', 'Cambridge, MA'] output is MIT, Cambridge, MA, USA, input as ['Rice University', 'Houston, TX'] output is Rice University, Houston, TX, USA, input as ['Yale University', 'New Haven, CT, USA'] output is Yale University, New Haven, CT, USA, input as ['Columbia University', 'New York, NY, USA'] output is Columbia University, New York, NY, USA, input as ['NYU', 'New York, New York, USA'] output is NYU, New York, New York, USA, input as ['UC Berkeley', 'Berkeley, CA'] output is UC Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA, input as ['UIUC', 'Urbana, IL'] output is UIUC, Urbana, IL, USA, input as ['Temple University', 'Philadelphia, PA'] output is Temple University, Philadelphia, PA, USA, input as ['Harvard University', 'Cambridge, MA, USA'] output is Harvard University, Cambridge, MA, USA, input as ['University of Connecticut', 'Storrs, CT, USA'] output is University of Connecticut, Storrs, CT, USA, input as ['Drexel University', 'Philadelphia, PA'] output is Drexel University, Philadelphia, PA, USA, input as ['New Haven University', 'New Haven, CT, USA'] output is New Haven University, New Haven, CT, USA, input as ['University of California, Santa Barbara', 'Santa Barbara, CA, USA'] output is University of California, Santa Barbara, Santa Barbara, CA, USA, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.

    This function takes the name of an institution and its geographical location as inputs,

    Parameters:
    institution_name (str): The name of the institution.
    location (str): The geographical location of the institution, including city and state.
                    The country "USA" may or may not be included.
