Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: To generate a summary that describes the relationship between the input and output, let's first understand the structure of the data provided.

### Input Data Structure:
- The input data is a list of strings, each representing a phone number.
- Each phone number is structured with a country code, followed by a space, and then three groups of digits separated by hyphens. For example, `+106 769-858-438`.
- The country code is prefixed with a `+` sign.

### Output Data Structure:
- The output data for each input is an integer, specifically the last group of digits from the corresponding input phone number. For example, for the input `+106 769-858-438`, the output is `438`.

### Summary of Input Data:
- The input data represents international phone numbers with varying country codes and number lengths.
- The format is consistent across all entries, with variations only in the digits themselves and the length of the country code.
- The country code and the number groups are separated by spaces and hyphens, respectively, providing a structured format.

### Summary of Output Data:
- The output data consistently extracts the last group of digits from each phone number in the input data.
- This group of digits varies in value but is always derived from the same position (the last group) in the input string.

### Relationship Summary:
- The relationship between the input and output data is a direct extraction process where the output is always the last group of digits from the input phone number.
- This extraction ignores the country code and the first two groups of digits, focusing solely on the final group.
- The process treats the input data qualitatively, focusing on the structure of the data rather than interpreting the numbers quantitatively.
- The consistent format of the input data allows for a straightforward extraction process, indicating a structured approach to handling and analyzing the data.

In summary, the relationship between the input and output data is defined by a structured extraction process that isolates the last group of digits from structured international phone numbers, treating the input qualitatively and focusing on the format and position of data within each entry., and input as ['+106 769-858-438'] output is 438, input as ['+83 973-757-831'] output is 831, input as ['+62 647-787-775'] output is 775, input as ['+172 027-507-632'] output is 632, input as ['+72 001-050-856'] output is 856, input as ['+95 310-537-401'] output is 401, input as ['+6 775-969-238'] output is 238, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
