Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Summary of Input Column Data

The input data column consists of strings that describe various economic activities or industries, followed in some cases by a geographical identifier (e.g., "US" for the United States, "CAN" for Canada). These activities span a range of sectors, including agriculture (e.g., "Soybean Farming"), resource extraction (e.g., "Mining", "Oil Extraction"), and food production (e.g., "Fishing"). The geographical identifiers suggest a focus on specific markets or regions where these activities are prominent. However, not all entries include a geographical identifier, indicating that some activities are considered in a more general or global context. The variety of industries represented in the input data highlights the diversity of economic activities that are significant for different regions and markets.

### Summary of Output Column Data

The output data column simplifies the input data by focusing solely on the economic activities or industries mentioned, removing any geographical identifiers. This process distills the information to the essence of the activity itself, irrespective of where it is taking place. The output data spans a similar range of sectors as the input, including agriculture, resource extraction, and food production. By removing the geographical context, the output data emphasizes the universal nature of these activities, suggesting their relevance across different regions and markets without being tied to a specific location.

### Summary of the Relationship Between Input and Output

The transformation from input to output data reveals a process of abstraction, where specific details (geographical identifiers) are removed to focus on the general nature of the economic activities described. This process suggests an analysis or reporting framework that aims to identify and discuss industries or sectors in a way that transcends regional specifics. It could be indicative of a study or database that is interested in the global characteristics or trends within certain economic activities, rather than the nuances of how these activities manifest in different geographical contexts. The relationship between input and output underscores a thematic interest in the economic activities themselves, while acknowledging but not prioritizing the geographical diversity of where these activities occur., and input as ['Mining US'] output is Mining, input as ['Soybean Farming CAN'] output is Soybean Farming, input as ['Soybean Farming'] output is Soybean Farming, input as ['Oil Extraction US'] output is Oil Extraction, input as ['Fishing'] output is Fishing, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
