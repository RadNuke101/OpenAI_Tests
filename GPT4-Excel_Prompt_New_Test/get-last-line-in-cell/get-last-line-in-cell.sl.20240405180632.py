Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: if there is more than one "2015", return everything after the last "/n", else return the inputted expression, and input as ['11/1/2015 - First call/n12/3/2015-order placed/n11/15/2015-follow-up,interested'] output is 11/15/2015-follow-up,interested, input as ['11/1/2015 - First call/n12/3/2015-order placed'] output is 12/3/2015-order placed, input as ['11/1/2015 - First call'] output is 11/1/2015 - First call, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
