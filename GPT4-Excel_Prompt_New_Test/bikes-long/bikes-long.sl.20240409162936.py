Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Input Column Summary:

The input data consists of a series of strings that combine a brand name with a numeric value. The brands represented in the data include Ducati, Honda, Acura, and Ferrari. The numeric values appended to these brand names are 100, 125, 250, and 550. These strings appear to follow a consistent format where the brand name comes first, immediately followed by the numeric value, without any spaces or separators. The combination of brand names and numeric values suggests a categorization or identification system, possibly related to models, types, or specifications within each brand.

### Output Column Summary:

The output data extracts and presents only the brand names from the input strings, removing the numeric values. The brands identified in the output are Ducati, Honda, Acura, and Ferrari. This indicates a consistent transformation from the input to the output, where the focus is shifted solely to the brand aspect of the input data, disregarding the numeric component.

### Relationship Summary:

The relationship between the input and output data is characterized by a filtering or extraction process, where the input strings, composed of both textual (brand names) and numeric components, are processed to isolate and output only the textual component. This transformation suggests that the purpose of the operation is to identify or categorize the input data based on brand names, irrespective of the specific numeric values that might indicate model numbers, versions, or other specifications associated with those brands. The process effectively abstracts the input data to a higher level of generality, focusing on brand identification rather than detailed specifications., and input as ['Ducati100'] output is Ducati, input as ['Honda125'] output is Honda, input as ['Ducati250'] output is Ducati, input as ['Honda250'] output is Honda, input as ['Honda550'] output is Honda, input as ['Ducati125'] output is Ducati, input as ['Acura100'] output is Acura, input as ['Acura125'] output is Acura, input as ['Ferrari250'] output is Ferrari, input as ['Ferrari250'] output is Ferrari, input as ['Honda550'] output is Honda, input as ['Ducati125'] output is Ducati, input as ['Ducati100'] output is Ducati, input as ['Honda125'] output is Honda, input as ['Ducati250'] output is Ducati, input as ['Honda250'] output is Honda, input as ['Honda550'] output is Honda, input as ['Ducati125'] output is Ducati, input as ['Acura100'] output is Acura, input as ['Acura125'] output is Acura, input as ['Ferrari250'] output is Ferrari, input as ['Ferrari250'] output is Ferrari, input as ['Honda550'] output is Honda, input as ['Ducati125'] output is Ducati, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
