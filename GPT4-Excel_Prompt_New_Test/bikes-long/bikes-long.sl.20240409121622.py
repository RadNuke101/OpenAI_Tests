Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Input Column Summary:

The input data consists of a series of strings that combine a brand name with a numerical value, without any spaces between them. The brand names observed in the dataset include Ducati, Honda, Acura, and Ferrari. The numerical values appended to these brand names are 100, 125, 250, and 550. These strings appear to represent models or versions of products, possibly vehicles, associated with these brands. The dataset includes repetitions of certain brand name and number combinations, indicating that the data may be collected from multiple instances or observations of these models or versions.

### Output Column Summary:

The output data extracted from the input strings consists solely of the brand names: Ducati, Honda, Acura, and Ferrari. This indicates that the process or function applied to the input data extracts or isolates the brand name from the combined string, disregarding the numerical value that follows the brand name in the input.

### Relationship Summary:

The relationship between the input and output data is a transformation process where the input strings, which are combinations of brand names and numerical values, are processed to extract only the brand names, discarding the numerical values. This process is consistent across all input data, regardless of the specific brand or numerical value involved. The output is solely dependent on the brand component of the input string, making the numerical value irrelevant to the output. This transformation suggests a focus on categorizing or identifying the brand aspect of the input data, which could be useful in contexts where the brand is more significant than the specific model or version number., and input as ['Ducati100'] output is Ducati, input as ['Honda125'] output is Honda, input as ['Ducati250'] output is Ducati, input as ['Honda250'] output is Honda, input as ['Honda550'] output is Honda, input as ['Ducati125'] output is Ducati, input as ['Acura100'] output is Acura, input as ['Acura125'] output is Acura, input as ['Ferrari250'] output is Ferrari, input as ['Ferrari250'] output is Ferrari, input as ['Honda550'] output is Honda, input as ['Ducati125'] output is Ducati, input as ['Ducati100'] output is Ducati, input as ['Honda125'] output is Honda, input as ['Ducati250'] output is Ducati, input as ['Honda250'] output is Honda, input as ['Honda550'] output is Honda, input as ['Ducati125'] output is Ducati, input as ['Acura100'] output is Acura, input as ['Acura125'] output is Acura, input as ['Ferrari250'] output is Ferrari, input as ['Ferrari250'] output is Ferrari, input as ['Honda550'] output is Honda, input as ['Ducati125'] output is Ducati, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
