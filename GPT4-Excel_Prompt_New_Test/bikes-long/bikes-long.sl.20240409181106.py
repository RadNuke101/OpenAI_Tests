Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Input Column Summary:

The input data consists of a series of strings that combine a brand name with a numerical value, presumably indicating a model or specification. The brands mentioned in the input data include Ducati, Honda, Acura, and Ferrari. The numerical values attached to these brand names vary and include 100, 125, 250, and 550. These inputs seem to follow a consistent format where the brand name comes first, immediately followed by the numerical value without any spaces or separators.

### Output Column Summary:

The output data extracts and presents only the brand name portion of the input strings, disregarding the numerical values entirely. The output for each input string is the brand name, which includes Ducati, Honda, Acura, and Ferrari. This indicates a clear relationship between the input and output data: the output is derived by isolating the alphabetical portion of the input string, effectively removing the numerical component.

### Relationship Summary:

The relationship between the input and output data is straightforward and consistent across all entries. The process involves extracting the brand name from the input string, which is a combination of letters and numbers, and presenting it as the output. This extraction process ignores the numerical values and focuses solely on the alphabetical characters that represent the brand name. The transformation from input to output does not depend on the specific numerical value attached to the brand name in the input; rather, it consistently isolates and outputs the brand name regardless of the accompanying number. This indicates that the operation performed on the input data is qualitative, focusing on the type (brand name) rather than the quantity (numerical value)., and input as ['Ducati100'] output is Ducati, input as ['Honda125'] output is Honda, input as ['Ducati250'] output is Ducati, input as ['Honda250'] output is Honda, input as ['Honda550'] output is Honda, input as ['Ducati125'] output is Ducati, input as ['Acura100'] output is Acura, input as ['Acura125'] output is Acura, input as ['Ferrari250'] output is Ferrari, input as ['Ferrari250'] output is Ferrari, input as ['Honda550'] output is Honda, input as ['Ducati125'] output is Ducati, input as ['Ducati100'] output is Ducati, input as ['Honda125'] output is Honda, input as ['Ducati250'] output is Ducati, input as ['Honda250'] output is Honda, input as ['Honda550'] output is Honda, input as ['Ducati125'] output is Ducati, input as ['Acura100'] output is Acura, input as ['Acura125'] output is Acura, input as ['Ferrari250'] output is Ferrari, input as ['Ferrari250'] output is Ferrari, input as ['Honda550'] output is Honda, input as ['Ducati125'] output is Ducati, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
