Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Input Column Summary

The input data consists of two columns, each containing strings. The first column includes strings of varying lengths and compositions, primarily consisting of uppercase alphabetic characters. These strings do not follow a specific pattern in terms of length or composition, indicating a diverse set of data points. The second column also contains strings, which appear to be subsets or segments of the strings in the first column. This column's strings are similarly composed of uppercase alphabetic characters and vary in length, though they tend to be shorter or equal in length to their corresponding strings in the first column.

### Output Column Summary

The output data is binary, consisting of boolean values: true or false. These values represent a specific relationship between the pair of strings in the input columns for each row. The output is determined by whether the string in the second input column is contained within the string in the first input column. If the second string is a substring of the first, the output is true; otherwise, it is false.

### Relationship Summary

The relationship between the input columns and the output column is based on the substring containment criterion. Specifically, the output (true or false) indicates whether the string in the second input column is a substring of the string in the first input column. This relationship is qualitative, focusing on the presence or absence of the second string within the first, rather than any quantitative measures such as the length of the strings or their alphabetical order. The analysis of this relationship is crucial for tasks that involve pattern recognition, string matching, or data validation, where understanding the connection between segments of text and larger text bodies is essential., and input as ['ABC', 'D'] output is false, input as ['ABC', 'BC'] output is true, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
