Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Summary for Input Column Data:

The input data consists of two main components for each entry: the name of a higher education institution (university or college) and its associated location. The names of the institutions vary widely, including both full names (e.g., "University of Pennsylvania") and abbreviations or informal names (e.g., "UCLA" for University of California, Los Angeles). The location information provided alongside these names is not uniformly formatted; it ranges from more detailed addresses including city, state, and country (e.g., "Philadelphia, PA, USA") to less detailed ones that might omit the country or use a less formal state abbreviation (e.g., "Los Angeles, CA"). The institutions mentioned are all based in the United States and are well-known, representing a mix of private and public universities across various states, including Pennsylvania, California, New York, Maryland, and Michigan. This diversity in naming conventions and location detail reflects the varied ways in which these institutions are commonly referred to in everyday language and official contexts.

### Summary for Output Column Data:

The output data standardizes the location information associated with each educational institution from the input data. It follows a consistent format: city, state abbreviation, and country ("USA"). This standardization process involves correcting misspellings (e.g., "Phialdelphia" to "Philadelphia"), formalizing state abbreviations (e.g., "New York" to "NY"), and ensuring the inclusion of the country ("USA") when it is missing from the input. The output effectively normalizes the diverse formats observed in the input data, providing a uniform representation of location information that is concise and easily understandable. This transformation is particularly useful for maintaining consistency in databases, improving readability, and facilitating location-based sorting or filtering.

### Relationship Between Input and Output:

The relationship between the input and output data demonstrates a process of standardization and correction. The input data's variability in naming conventions for institutions and the level of detail or accuracy in location information is streamlined in the output to follow a uniform format. This process involves correcting typographical errors, standardizing state names to their two-letter abbreviations, and ensuring the presence of the country designation "USA" for all entries. The transformation highlights the importance of consistency in data representation, especially for applications that require uniformity for effective data management, analysis, or presentation. The output data serves as a refined version of the input, maintaining the essential location information while enhancing readability and uniformity., and input as ['University of Pennsylvania', 'Phialdelphia, PA, USA'] output is Phialdelphia, PA, USA, input as ['UCLA', 'Los Angeles, CA'] output is Los Angeles, CA, USA, input as ['Cornell University', 'Ithaca, New York, USA'] output is Ithaca, NY, USA, input as ['Penn', 'Philadelphia, PA, USA'] output is Philadelphia, PA, USA, input as ['University of Maryland College Park', 'College Park, MD'] output is College Park, MD, USA, input as ['University of Michigan', 'Ann Arbor, MI, USA'] output is Ann Arbor, MI, USA, input as ['Columbia University', 'New York, NY, USA'] output is New York, NY, USA, input as ['NYU', 'New York, New York, USA'] output is New York, NY, USA, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
