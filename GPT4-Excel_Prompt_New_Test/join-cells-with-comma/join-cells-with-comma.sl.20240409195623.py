Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Input Column Summary:

The input data consists of lists, each containing a selection of fruit names. These names are qualitative in nature, representing different types of fruits. The lists vary in length and may include empty strings, indicating missing or unspecified fruit types. The variety of fruits mentioned across the input lists includes figs, apples, mangos, kiwis, and grapes, among others not specified. This diversity suggests a broad interest in or representation of various fruits, possibly reflecting different preferences, seasons, or availability.

### Output Column Summary:

The output data retains the essence of the input lists but with a notable modification: the removal of empty strings. This results in cleaner, more concise lists that only include specified fruit names. The output maintains the order of the non-empty elements from the input, ensuring that the relational context between the input and output is preserved. The types of fruits in the output remain diverse, reflecting the input's variety without alteration to the fruit types themselves.

### Relationship Summary:

The transformation from the input to the output column demonstrates a process of data cleaning or refinement, where unspecified or missing values (represented by empty strings) are removed. This process does not alter the type or order of the fruits listed, ensuring that the qualitative nature of the data—specifically, the types of fruits—is preserved. The relationship between the input and output columns highlights a focus on maintaining only meaningful, specified data while discarding elements that do not contribute valuable information (empty strings). This transformation can be particularly useful in contexts where the clarity and quality of the data are paramount, such as in data analysis, inventory management, or consumer preference studies. The process underscores the importance of clean, precise data in qualitative analyses and the utility of filtering out non-contributory elements to focus on relevant, specified information., and input as ['figs', '', 'apples'] output is figs, apples, input as ['mangos', 'kiwis', 'grapes'] output is mangos, kiwis, grapes, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
