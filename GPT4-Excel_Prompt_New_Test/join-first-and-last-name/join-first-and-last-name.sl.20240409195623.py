Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Input Column Data Summary

The input data consists of two columns, each containing qualitative, textual information. The first column is presumed to contain first names, while the second column contains last names. The names are of individuals, suggesting a personal or demographic context. The data in both columns is character-based, likely representing a diverse set of individuals. The names provided in the examples, such as 'susan', 'chang', 'aaron', and 'kim', indicate a variety of cultural backgrounds, pointing towards a dataset that encompasses a broad spectrum of identities. The first names and last names are kept separate, indicating a structured approach to data collection where individual components of a person's full name are distinctly categorized.

### Output Column Data Summary

The output data is a concatenation of the first and last names from the input columns, forming full names. The output is also qualitative, textual information. The transformation from input to output involves a simple combination of the two input columns with a space character between the first and last names, resulting in a standard representation of a person's full name. This process preserves the integrity and identity of the individuals represented in the data, making the output more human-readable and recognizable as personal names. The output, like the input, reflects a diversity of names, suggesting the output data set maintains the cultural and personal diversity present in the input data.

### Relationship Between Input and Output

The relationship between the input columns and the output column is a direct transformational one, where the two separate pieces of qualitative data (first name and last name) are merged into a single piece of qualitative data (full name). This transformation is consistent and uniform across the dataset, indicating a systematic approach to generating full names from separate name components. The process does not alter the original data but rather restructures it into a more conventional format for representing names. This relationship highlights the importance of maintaining the integrity and identity of individuals in the dataset while adapting the data format to suit different contexts or requirements, such as readability or database management. The transformation from input to output does not introduce new information but reorganizes existing information into a more socially recognizable form., and input as ['susan', 'chang'] output is susan chang, input as ['aaron', 'kim'] output is aaron kim, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
