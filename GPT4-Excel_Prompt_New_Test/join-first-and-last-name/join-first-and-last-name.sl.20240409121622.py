Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Summary for Input Column Data:

The input data consists of two columns, each containing qualitative, personal names. The first column appears to contain given names, while the second column seems to include surnames. The names are diverse, suggesting a variety of cultural or ethnic backgrounds. The data in both columns are textual and represent individual identifiers. The given names and surnames are distinct, indicating that they belong to separate categories of personal names, with the first names likely representing personal identifiers and the surnames representing family or ancestral identifiers.

### Summary for Output Column Data:

The output data combines the information from the two input columns into a single string per row, creating full names by concatenating the given name and surname with a space in between. This transformation suggests that the output is a more complete representation of an individual's identity, as it combines both their personal and family identifiers. The output maintains the qualitative nature of the input data but presents it in a format that is commonly used to address or refer to individuals in both formal and informal contexts.

### Relationship Between Input and Output:

The relationship between the input and output data is a transformational one, where the input data, consisting of separate given names and surnames, is merged to form complete names in the output. This process does not alter the qualitative nature of the data but changes its structure and presentation to reflect a more commonly used format for identifying individuals. The transformation from separate names to full names is a direct and linear process, with each row's output being a predictable and straightforward concatenation of the corresponding input columns. This process highlights the importance of both components of a person's name in constructing their full identity and provides a unified way to refer to individuals., and input as ['susan', 'chang'] output is susan chang, input as ['aaron', 'kim'] output is aaron kim, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
