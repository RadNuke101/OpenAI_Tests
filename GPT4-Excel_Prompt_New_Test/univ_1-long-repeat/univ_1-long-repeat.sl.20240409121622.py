Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Summary for Input Column Data:

The input data consists of two columns, each representing distinct but related pieces of information about various educational institutions. The first column details the names of universities or colleges, which include a mix of abbreviations (e.g., "UCLA", "MIT", "NYU", "UIUC") and full names (e.g., "University of Pennsylvania", "Cornell University", "Harvard University"). These names cover a broad spectrum of well-known institutions across the United States, indicating a focus on higher education entities.

The second column provides specific geographic locations associated with each institution listed in the first column. These locations are detailed to varying degrees of specificity, from city and state combinations (e.g., "Berkeley, CA", "Urbana, IL") to more detailed addresses that include the country, particularly for locations that might be less internationally recognized without the country specified (e.g., "Ithaca, New York, USA", "Ann Arbor, MI, USA"). The inclusion of the country in some entries suggests an awareness of a potentially international audience or context.

### Summary for Output Column Data:

The output data combines the information provided in the two input columns into a single, cohesive string for each institution. This amalgamation follows a consistent format: the name of the institution followed by a comma and the geographical location as specified in the input. The output retains the level of detail provided in the input, including the use of abbreviations for some university names and the varying levels of geographical specificity. This format effectively consolidates the two pieces of input data into a concise descriptor that would be useful for quick reference, identification, or in contexts where both the name and location of an institution are required succinctly.

### Relationship Between Input and Output:

The relationship between the input columns and the output column is a straightforward transformation that merges the separate pieces of information (institution name and location) into a single, unified string. This process does not alter the original data but restructures it to create a more compact and easily digestible format. The output demonstrates a clear, logical connection to its inputs, serving as a summary that combines two related pieces of information into one. This transformation is consistent across all entries, indicating a systematic approach to data consolidation that could be particularly useful in databases, directories, or any application where space is at a premium or where quick, comprehensive identification is needed., and input as ['UC Berkeley', 'Berkeley, CA'] output is UC Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, input as ['University of Pennsylvania', 'Phialdelphia, PA, USA'] output is University of Pennsylvania, Phialdelphia, PA, USA, input as ['UCLA', 'Los Angeles, CA'] output is UCLA, Los Angeles, CA, input as ['Cornell University', 'Ithaca, New York, USA'] output is Cornell University, Ithaca, New York, USA, input as ['Penn', 'Philadelphia, PA, USA'] output is Penn, Philadelphia, PA, USA, input as ['University of Michigan', 'Ann Arbor, MI, USA'] output is University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA, input as ['UC Berkeley', 'Berkeley, CA'] output is UC Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, input as ['MIT', 'Cambridge, MA'] output is MIT, Cambridge, MA, input as ['University of Pennsylvania', 'Phialdelphia, PA, USA'] output is University of Pennsylvania, Phialdelphia, PA, USA, input as ['UCLA', 'Los Angeles, CA'] output is UCLA, Los Angeles, CA, input as ['University of Maryland College Park', 'College Park, MD'] output is University of Maryland College Park, College Park, MD, input as ['University of Michigan', 'Ann Arbor, MI, USA'] output is University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA, input as ['UC Berkeley', 'Berkeley, CA'] output is UC Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, input as ['MIT', 'Cambridge, MA'] output is MIT, Cambridge, MA, input as ['Rice University', 'Houston, TX'] output is Rice University, Houston, TX, input as ['Yale University', 'New Haven, CT, USA'] output is Yale University, New Haven, CT, USA, input as ['Columbia University', 'New York, NY, USA'] output is Columbia University, New York, NY, USA, input as ['NYU', 'New York, New York, USA'] output is NYU, New York, New York, USA, input as ['Drexel University', 'Philadelphia, PA'] output is Drexel University, Philadelphia, PA, input as ['UC Berkeley', 'Berkeley, CA'] output is UC Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, input as ['UIUC', 'Urbana, IL'] output is UIUC, Urbana, IL, input as ['Temple University', 'Philadelphia, PA'] output is Temple University, Philadelphia, PA, input as ['Harvard University', 'Cambridge, MA, USA'] output is Harvard University, Cambridge, MA, USA, input as ['University of Connecticut', 'Storrs, CT, USA'] output is University of Connecticut, Storrs, CT, USA, input as ['Drexel University', 'Philadelphia, PA'] output is Drexel University, Philadelphia, PA, input as ['NYU', 'New York, New York, USA'] output is NYU, New York, New York, USA, input as ['UIUC', 'Urbana, IL'] output is UIUC, Urbana, IL, input as ['New Haven University', 'New Haven, CT, USA'] output is New Haven University, New Haven, CT, USA, input as ['University of California, Santa Barbara', 'Santa Barbara, CA, USA'] output is University of California, Santa Barbara, Santa Barbara, CA, USA, input as ['University of Connecticut', 'Storrs, CT, USA'] output is University of Connecticut, Storrs, CT, USA, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
