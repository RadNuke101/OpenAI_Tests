Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Input Column Summary:

The input data consists of textual statements or phrases that vary in their content and structure. These statements can be idiomatic expressions, as seen in the examples involving the value of a bird in hand versus those in the bush, or they can be informative, such as highlighting a list of shortcuts. The variation in the input data suggests a focus on the linguistic or semantic aspects of the text, including the use of numbers (written as numerals or spelled out) and the conveyance of ideas or advice. The diversity in the input content indicates that the analysis might be centered around the interpretation, representation, or specific characteristics of the text, such as the presence of numerical information and its expression.

### Output Column Summary:

The output data is binary, represented by true or false values. These values seem to be determined based on specific criteria related to the input text. The criteria for determining the output value are not explicitly stated but can be inferred to involve the analysis of the text's content, structure, or specific features such as the representation of numbers or the accuracy and completeness of the information provided.

### Relationship Summary:

The relationship between the input and output columns appears to be governed by how certain elements or characteristics within the input text meet specific criteria or rules. One observable pattern is the representation of numbers within the text; for instance, when numbers are represented as numerals, the output tends to be true, and when they are spelled out, the output is false. This pattern, however, is not universally applicable, as the context or other textual features might also play a role in determining the output. The true or false output could be indicative of the text meeting certain predefined conditions, such as clarity, accuracy, or the presence of specific keywords or formats.

In summary, the relationship between the input and output data hinges on the analysis of textual characteristics, with a particular emphasis on the representation and interpretation of numerical information within the text. The output seems to reflect whether the input text adheres to certain criteria, possibly related to clarity, precision, or the effective conveyance of information., and input as ['A bird in the hand is worth 2 in the bush.'] output is true, input as ['A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush.'] output is false, input as ['The 15 shortcuts you simply must know'] output is true, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
