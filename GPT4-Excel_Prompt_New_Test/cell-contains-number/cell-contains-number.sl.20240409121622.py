Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Summary of Input Column Data:

The input data consists of textual phrases or sentences that appear to be excerpts from larger texts or standalone proverbs/sayings. These inputs vary in their structure and content, ranging from well-known proverbs to potentially informative or instructional statements. The variation in content suggests a diverse set of criteria for evaluation, possibly focusing on the specificity, accuracy, or some form of textual integrity. Notably, the inputs demonstrate a mix of numerical representation (using digits or words) and potentially the presence or absence of specific details or keywords that might be crucial for the evaluation process.

### Summary of Output Column Data:

The output data is binary, represented by boolean values true or false. This binary nature indicates a clear, dichotomous evaluation criterion applied to the input data, suggesting that the inputs are assessed based on a specific rule or set of rules that yield a straightforward yes/no, true/false determination. The nature of these outputs implies a consistency in the evaluation process, where each input is subjected to the same criteria to determine its truth value.

### Relationship Between Input and Output:

The relationship between the input and output data suggests a rule-based evaluation process where specific characteristics of the input text determine the output's boolean value. For instance, the use of numerical digits in place of words for numbers in the input seems to correlate with a true output, as seen in the first and third examples. Conversely, the use of words to represent numbers, as in the second example, correlates with a false output. This pattern implies that the evaluation criteria might include the representation of numbers, the presence of specific keywords, or adherence to a particular format or structure within the text.

Moreover, the binary nature of the output suggests that the evaluation process is designed to assess the input against a binary condition or a set of conditions that can be clearly categorized as met or unmet. This could involve checking for accuracy, specificity, adherence to a known version of a saying or phrase, or the presence of elements deemed necessary for the input to be considered "true" under the evaluation criteria.

In summary, the relationship between the input and output data points towards a rule-based evaluation system where specific features of the input text, such as the representation of numbers and possibly the adherence to certain textual standards or expectations, play a crucial role in determining the output's boolean value., and input as ['A bird in the hand is worth 2 in the bush.'] output is true, input as ['A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush.'] output is false, input as ['The 15 shortcuts you simply must know'] output is true, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
