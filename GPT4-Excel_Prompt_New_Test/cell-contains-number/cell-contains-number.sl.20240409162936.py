Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Input Column Summary:

The input column consists of textual data that appears to be phrases or sentences extracted from a larger context. These inputs vary in their content, ranging from proverbial expressions to potentially informative or instructional statements. The examples provided include a well-known proverb about value and opportunity, represented in two slightly different forms, and a statement that seems to be a headline or a title likely from an article or blog post about productivity or technology shortcuts. The variations in the input data suggest a focus on the specific wording or numerical representation within the sentences.

### Output Column Summary:

The output column contains boolean values (true or false) that correspond to each input. The pattern of outputs suggests a relationship between the specific form of the input text and the resulting boolean value. The output seems to be determined by whether the input text adheres to certain criteria, which could be related to the representation of numbers, the exact wording of phrases, or other specific characteristics of the text.

### Relationship Summary:

The relationship between the input and output columns appears to hinge on specific characteristics of the input text, particularly in how information is presented. For example, the difference in output for the two versions of the proverb about a bird in the hand suggests that the numerical representation (using digits vs. words) plays a crucial role in determining the output. Similarly, the output for the statement about shortcuts being true might indicate that the presence of numerical information or the format of the statement influences the output.

In summary, the output seems to be true when the input text contains numerical information presented in digits or when the input adheres to a certain format or criteria not explicitly defined but inferred to be related to the specificity and presentation of information. Conversely, the output is false when the input deviates from this pattern, such as using words to represent numbers in a proverbial context. This relationship underscores the importance of the form and presentation of information in the input text in determining the boolean output., and input as ['A bird in the hand is worth 2 in the bush.'] output is true, input as ['A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush.'] output is false, input as ['The 15 shortcuts you simply must know'] output is true, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
