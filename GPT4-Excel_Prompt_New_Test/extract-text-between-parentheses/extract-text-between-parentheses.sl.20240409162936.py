Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Summary of Input Column Data

The input data consists of strings formatted in a specific way, where each entry follows a pattern that includes a name followed by a space, then a numerical value enclosed within angle brackets. The name part of the string remains consistent as "Jones" across all entries, indicating that the data might pertain to a single entity or subject named Jones. The numerical value within the angle brackets varies across entries, suggesting that this value is the primary variable or attribute of interest in the dataset. The format of the input data suggests that it is designed to convey specific, structured information about an individual or entity, with the numerical value possibly representing a measurable attribute or characteristic related to Jones.

### Summary of Output Column Data

The output data consists of numerical values extracted from the input data. These values correspond to the numbers enclosed within angle brackets in the input strings. The output values are integers, and they vary across entries, indicating that they represent a quantifiable attribute or characteristic that changes from one entry to another. The extraction of these values from the input data suggests that the primary interest lies in analyzing or utilizing these numerical values, separate from the textual context provided in the input.

### Relationship Between Input and Output

The relationship between the input and output data is a direct extraction process where the output values are derived from the input strings by isolating and extracting the numerical values enclosed within angle brackets. This process transforms qualitative, structured text data into quantitative, numerical data that can be more easily analyzed or processed for various purposes. The consistent presence of the name "Jones" in the input data alongside the variable numerical values suggests that the dataset is focused on tracking or recording a specific attribute or characteristic of Jones, with the output data representing a distilled, numeric representation of this attribute for each entry. The transformation from input to output effectively simplifies the data, removing textual context to focus solely on the numerical aspect of the information provided., and input as ['Jones <60>'] output is 60, input as ['Jones <57>'] output is 57, input as ['Jones <55>'] output is 55, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
