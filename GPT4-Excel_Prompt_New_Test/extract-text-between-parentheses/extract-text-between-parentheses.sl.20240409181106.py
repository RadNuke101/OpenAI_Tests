Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Summary for Input Column Data:

The input data consists of strings formatted in a specific pattern where each entry includes a name followed by a space and an age value enclosed within angle brackets. The name part of the string, represented here as "Jones," remains constant across all entries, indicating a uniform identifier for all data points. The age value, encapsulated within the angle brackets, varies across the entries, indicating a variable component of the data. The format "<age>" is consistent, suggesting a structured way of presenting age information within the dataset. The input data, therefore, combines a fixed qualitative component (the name "Jones") with a variable quantitative component (the age value), presented in a qualitative format due to its inclusion in a string.

### Summary for Output Column Data:

The output data extracted from the input strings is purely quantitative, representing the age values as integers. These values are directly derived from the variable component of the input data, specifically the numbers enclosed within the angle brackets. The output data set consists of age values such as 60, 57, and 55, indicating a direct relationship between the input and output where the output serves as a simplified, numeric representation of the variable component of the input data.

### Relationship Summary between Input and Output:

The relationship between the input and output data is characterized by a transformation process where a specific piece of information (the age value) is extracted from a structured string format in the input and presented as a standalone numeric value in the output. This transformation involves parsing the input string to identify and isolate the age value enclosed within angle brackets, then converting this value from a string representation to an integer for the output. The constant component of the input data (the name "Jones") is disregarded in the output, highlighting a selective extraction process focused solely on the variable, quantitative information within the input. The relationship underscores a methodical approach to data simplification and extraction, where qualitative data containing embedded quantitative information is processed to yield purely quantitative output., and input as ['Jones <60>'] output is 60, input as ['Jones <57>'] output is 57, input as ['Jones <55>'] output is 55, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
