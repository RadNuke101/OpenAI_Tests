Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Summary of Input Column Data:

The input data consists of strings representing phone numbers in a specific format. Each string begins with a '+' sign, followed by a country code (one to three digits), a space, and then a three-part phone number separated by hyphens. The country code varies in length, indicating that the dataset includes phone numbers from various countries. The three-part phone number format is consistent across all entries, suggesting a standardized representation of phone numbers within the dataset. The presence of the '+' sign and the country code indicates that these are international phone numbers. The dataset showcases a variety of phone numbers, each uniquely identified by its country code and subsequent number sequence.

### Summary of Output Column Data:

The output data transforms the input phone numbers into a different format. The transformation involves removing the space and hyphens from the input and replacing them with periods. The '+' sign is omitted in the output, focusing solely on the numeric part of the phone number, now segmented by periods. This format retains the country code and the three-part phone number structure but uses periods as separators instead of hyphens, providing a cleaner and more uniform representation of the phone numbers. The output format emphasizes the numeric sequence of the phone numbers, making it easier to read and possibly aligning with a specific standard or preference for displaying phone numbers.

### Relationship Between Input and Output:

The transformation from input to output represents a reformatting of international phone numbers from one standard to another. The key operations in this transformation include the removal of the '+' sign, indicating a shift away from explicitly marking the numbers as international. The replacement of spaces and hyphens with periods serves to unify the appearance of the phone numbers, possibly catering to a specific formatting requirement or aesthetic preference. This process does not alter the essential components of the phone numbers (i.e., the country code and the number itself) but rather changes how they are presented. The consistent application of this transformation across various country codes and phone numbers suggests a systematic approach to reformatting phone numbers for a particular use case or database requirement., and input as ['+106 769-858-438'] output is 106.769.858.438, input as ['+83 973-757-831'] output is 83.973.757.831, input as ['+62 647-787-775'] output is 62.647.787.775, input as ['+172 027-507-632'] output is 172.027.507.632, input as ['+72 001-050-856'] output is 72.001.050.856, input as ['+95 310-537-401'] output is 95.310.537.401, input as ['+6 775-969-238'] output is 6.775.969.238, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
