Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Summary of Input Column Data:

The input data consists of strings that represent URLs. These URLs are unique in their structure, varying primarily in their domain names and paths. Each string starts with a protocol identifier (either "https" or "http"), followed by "://". The domain name comes next, which can include subdomains (e.g., "www"). After the domain, there is a path that starts with a "/" and includes one or more segments separated by "/". The path segments can contain different types of characters, including letters and hyphens. The input data showcases a variety of website addresses, each leading to a specific page or resource within the domain.

### Summary of Output Column Data:

The output data retains the protocol and domain name from the input URLs but omits the path segments. Each output string ends right after the domain name, with a trailing slash ("/") to indicate the root of the domain. This transformation suggests a simplification or generalization of the input URLs, focusing on the domain's root rather than specific pages or resources. The output uniformly presents the base address of the websites, disregarding the specifics of the paths and any additional segments that might indicate deeper navigation within the site.

### Relationship Between Input and Output:

The transformation from input to output data demonstrates a process of abstraction, where specific and detailed URLs are generalized to their domain roots. This process involves:

1. **Preserving the Protocol**: The protocol part of the URL (either "http" or "https") is kept intact, maintaining the essential scheme for accessing the web resources.
2. **Retaining the Domain**: The domain name, including any subdomains, is preserved, highlighting the primary web entity or host.
3. **Removing the Path**: The path, which specifies a particular resource or page within the domain, is omitted. This step simplifies the URL to its most basic form, focusing on the domain's root.

This relationship indicates a methodical reduction of information, where the specific locations within a website (indicated by paths) are considered less relevant or unnecessary for the output's purpose. The output data provides a uniform view of the base addresses of various websites, potentially useful for tasks that require domain-level analysis or categorization without the need for detailed path information., and input as ['https=//abc.com/def'] output is https=//abc.com/, input as ['http=//www.abc.com/def/cef'] output is http=//www.abc.com, input as ['http=//chandoo.org/wp/def-def'] output is http=//chandoo.org/, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
