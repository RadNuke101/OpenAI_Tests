Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: To generate summaries for each input column and the output column based on the provided examples, we'll first identify the nature of each input and then describe the relationship between these inputs and the output. The examples given are:

1. `['year= 2016']` output is 2016
2. `['make= subaru']` output is subaru
3. `['model= outback wagon']` output is outback wagon
4. `['fuel economy= 25/33']` output is 25/33

### Input Column Summaries

**Year:**
- The "Year" column represents the manufacturing year of a vehicle. It is a numerical representation, typically a four-digit number, indicating the year when the vehicle was produced. This information is crucial for identifying the age of the vehicle and potentially its generation or version, as manufacturers often update models over the years.

**Make:**
- The "Make" column specifies the brand or manufacturer of the vehicle. It is a textual representation, consisting of the name of the company that produced the vehicle. This information is essential for identifying the overall quality, reputation, and market segment of the vehicle, as different manufacturers are known for varying levels of reliability, luxury, and performance.

**Model:**
- The "Model" column indicates the specific model of the vehicle produced by the manufacturer. It is a combination of text and possibly numbers, providing a more detailed identification than the make alone. This information helps in understanding the specific features, size, and type of vehicle (e.g., sedan, SUV, wagon).

**Fuel Economy:**
- The "Fuel Economy" column represents the efficiency of the vehicle in terms of fuel consumption. It is typically given as a ratio or a pair of numbers indicating miles per gallon (MPG) in city driving and highway driving, respectively. This information is vital for assessing the vehicle's environmental impact and operating cost.

### Output Column Summary

The output for each input column directly corresponds to the value provided for that column. It appears that the output is a straightforward extraction of the value associated with each input category (year, make, model, fuel economy) without any transformation or processing. This suggests a one-to-one relationship between the input and the output, where the output serves as a direct reflection or echo of the specific attribute's value from the input.

### Relationship Summary

The relationship between the input columns and the output is characterized by a direct mapping from the specific vehicle attribute described in each input column to its corresponding value in the output. Each input column (year, make, model, fuel economy) provides a distinct piece of qualitative information about a vehicle, and the output simply mirrors this information without alteration. This setup could be part of a system designed to extract and present specific details from a larger dataset or to facilitate the filtering and selection of vehicles based on these attributes. The simplicity of the relationship suggests that the primary function is to isolate and highlight individual vehicle characteristics for further analysis or display., and input as ['year= 2016'] output is 2016, input as ['make= subaru'] output is subaru, input as ['model= outback wagon'] output is outback wagon, input as ['fuel economy= 25/33'] output is 25/33, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
