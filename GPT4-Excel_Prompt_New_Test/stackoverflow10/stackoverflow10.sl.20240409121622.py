Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Input Column Summary:

The input data consists of strings representing specific dates, with most entries following a standard format of "[Month] [Day] [Year]". Some entries include additional context or descriptions following the year, such as the name of a township or a specific designation in angled brackets or plain text. The months mentioned span across various times of the year, indicating no specific concentration on any particular season. The days mentioned vary from single-digit to double-digit numbers, covering a wide range of dates within a month. The years span from the early 18th century to the late 19th century, indicating a historical context for the data. The additional descriptions, where present, seem to indicate a significant event or designation related to the date, possibly the establishment of townships or changes in administrative status.

### Output Column Summary:

The output data consists of four-digit numbers, each representing a year extracted from the corresponding input string. These years range from the early 18th century (1721) to the late 19th century (1892), highlighting a broad historical timeline. The output data uniformly focuses on the year component of the input data, disregarding the month, day, and any additional contextual information provided in the input.

### Relationship Summary:

The relationship between the input and output data is straightforward: the output is derived by extracting the year component from the input strings. Regardless of the format variations in the input data, including the presence of additional text or descriptions, the output consistently focuses on isolating and presenting the year as a four-digit number. This extraction process ignores all other components of the input data, such as the specific day, month, and any supplementary descriptions or designations associated with the date. The purpose of the output data appears to be to highlight the historical year associated with each input entry, possibly to emphasize the chronological aspect of the events or designations mentioned in the input., and input as ['April 1 1799'] output is 1799, input as ['April 11 1867'] output is 1867, input as ['February 12 1806'] output is 1806, input as ['February 21 1798'] output is 1798, input as ['February 28 1844 as Delaware Township'] output is 1844, input as ['February 5 1798'] output is 1798, input as ['February 7 1892 Verona Township'] output is 1892, input as ['February 9 1797'] output is 1797, input as ['January 19 1748'] output is 1748, input as ['July 10 1721 as Upper Penns Neck Township'] output is 1721, input as ['March 15 1860'] output is 1860, input as ['March 17 1870 <as Raritan Township>'] output is 1870, input as ['March 17 1874'] output is 1874, input as ['March 23 1864'] output is 1864, input as ['March 5 1867'] output is 1867, input as ['April 28th 1828'] output is 1828, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
