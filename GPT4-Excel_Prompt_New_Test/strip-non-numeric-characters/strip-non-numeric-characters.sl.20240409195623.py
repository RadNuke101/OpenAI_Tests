Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Summary for Input Column Data:

The input data consists of strings that contain a mix of text and numerical values. These strings appear to follow a certain contextual theme, such as mentioning a quantity of items (e.g., '100 apples'), stating a price (e.g., 'the price is %500 dollars'), or specifying a serial number (e.g., 'serial number %003399'). The numerical values are embedded within sentences that provide some context about what the numbers represent, whether it's a quantity, a price, or an identifier. The presence of symbols like '%' in some of the inputs suggests that the format of the numerical information can vary, including both plain numbers and numbers prefixed with special characters.

### Summary for Output Column Data:

The output data extracts and isolates the numerical values from the input strings, presenting them as standalone entities. These outputs retain the format of the numbers as they appear in the input, including leading zeros (e.g., '003399') and plain numerical values (e.g., '100', '500'). The output data strips away all textual context and symbols not part of the numerical value itself, focusing solely on the numerical information contained within the input strings.

### Summary Describing the Relationship Between Input and Output:

The relationship between the input and output data is characterized by a process of extracting and isolating numerical values from a textual context. The output is generated by identifying and removing the numerical component from the input strings, disregarding any textual content or symbols that are not part of the numerical value itself. This process suggests a consistent method of parsing the input data to identify numerical information, regardless of the surrounding text or the presence of special characters. The output faithfully represents the numerical values as they are presented in the input, maintaining any formatting, such as leading zeros. This indicates that the transformation from input to output is focused on preserving the integrity of the numerical data while removing extraneous textual information., and input as ['100 apples'] output is 100, input as ['the price is %500 dollars'] output is 500, input as ['serial number %003399'] output is 003399, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
