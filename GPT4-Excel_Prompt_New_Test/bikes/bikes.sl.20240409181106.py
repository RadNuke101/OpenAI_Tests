Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Input Column Summary:

The input data consists of strings that are a combination of a brand name followed by a numeric value. The brand names observed in the input data are "Ducati" and "Honda." The numeric values appended to these brand names vary and include 100, 125, 250, and 550. The structure of the input data follows a consistent pattern where the brand name comes first, directly concatenated with a numeric value, without any spaces or delimiters between them.

### Output Column Summary:

The output data extracted from the input strings consists solely of the brand names, which are "Ducati" and "Honda." The numeric values present in the input data are not included in the output data. The output is purely qualitative, representing the brand component of the input strings.

### Relationship Summary:

The relationship between the input and output data is a direct extraction process where the output is derived by isolating the brand name component from the input strings. The numeric values attached to the brand names in the input data do not influence the output, as they are consistently omitted across all instances. The process appears to be a form of data parsing or string manipulation, where the goal is to extract the qualitative (brand name) part of a mixed-format string, disregarding the quantitative (numeric) part. This indicates a clear, consistent rule applied to all input data: extract the brand name, irrespective of the numeric value that follows it., and input as ['Ducati100'] output is Ducati, input as ['Honda125'] output is Honda, input as ['Ducati250'] output is Ducati, input as ['Honda250'] output is Honda, input as ['Honda550'] output is Honda, input as ['Ducati125'] output is Ducati, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
