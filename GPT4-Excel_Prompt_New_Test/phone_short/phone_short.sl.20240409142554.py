Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Summary of Input Column Data

The input data consists of strings formatted as three groups of three digits each, separated by hyphens (e.g., 'XXX-XXX-XXX'). Each entry in the input column is unique, indicating a diverse dataset without repetition. The structure of the input data is consistent across all entries, adhering to the specified format. The input data does not immediately reveal any discernible pattern or sequence that correlates with the output data based solely on a qualitative assessment. Each group of digits within the input strings appears to be randomly generated, with no apparent relationship between the groups of numbers within each entry.

### Summary of Output Column Data

The output data consists of integers extracted from the input data. Specifically, the output for each entry is the first group of three digits from the corresponding input string. This indicates a direct relationship between the input and output data, where the output is a subset of the input. The output data, like the input, does not repeat, reflecting the uniqueness of each input entry. The output values range from low to high, with no discernible pattern in their distribution that suggests any qualitative attributes or categorizations beyond their extraction from the input.

### Relationship Between Input and Output

The relationship between the input and output data is straightforward and consistent: the output is derived directly from the input by extracting the first group of three digits. This process is applied uniformly across all entries, indicating a rule-based relationship where the output is always the initial segment of the input string before the first hyphen. There is no indication that the remaining digits in the input (those after the first hyphen) have any influence on the output. The transformation from input to output is purely extractive, with no modification of the extracted digits. This relationship suggests that the input data contains the necessary information for determining the output, and the output can be predicted with certainty if the input format is known and adhered to., and input as ['938-242-504'] output is 938, input as ['308-916-545'] output is 308, input as ['623-599-749'] output is 623, input as ['981-424-843'] output is 981, input as ['118-980-214'] output is 118, input as ['244-655-094'] output is 244, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
