Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Input Column Summary

The input column consists of names in a format that appears to follow a structure common in some cultures, particularly East Asian cultures, where the family name (surname) often precedes the given name. The data provided contains pairs of names, which could either be two given names, two surnames, or a combination of both. The names are presented as a single string within an array, suggesting that each entry is considered a single data point. The examples given include combinations of names such as "Park Kim," "Lee Kim," and "Kim Lee." This indicates a mix of potentially both surnames and given names without clear distinction in the input format regarding which part of the name is which.

### Output Column Summary

The output column consistently presents what appears to be the second name from the input data. Regardless of whether the name in the input is traditionally a surname or a given name, the output selects the latter part of the input string. This suggests a rule or pattern in the output generation process that focuses on the position of the name within the input string rather than its cultural or nominal significance as a given name or surname.

### Relationship Summary

The relationship between the input and output data can be summarized as follows:

- The output is generated based on the position of names within the input string, specifically selecting the name that appears last in the input.
- There is no distinction made between surnames and given names in the process of generating the output. The cultural or traditional significance of the name's position (whether it is a surname or a given name) does not influence which part of the input is selected for the output.
- The process is consistent across the examples provided, indicating a rule-based approach to generating the output from the input data. This rule is simple: extract and output the name that appears in the final position of the input string.

This summary highlights a straightforward positional relationship between the input and output data, focusing solely on the order of names within the input without consideration for their cultural or nominal significance., and input as ['Park Kim'] output is Kim, input as ['Lee Kim'] output is Kim, input as ['Kim Lee'] output is Lee, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
