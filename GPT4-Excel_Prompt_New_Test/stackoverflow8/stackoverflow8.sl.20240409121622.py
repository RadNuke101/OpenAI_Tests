Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Summary for Input Column Data:

The input data consists of file paths in a standardized format, each leading to an Excel file (.xls). These paths are strings that include directories and subdirectories, culminating in the file name with its extension. The structure of these paths suggests a hierarchical file system, typical in operating systems like Windows, Linux, or macOS. Each path starts from a root directory (e.g., 'home'), followed by one or more subdirectories (e.g., 'Excel', 'user'), and ends with the file name (e.g., 'Sheet1.xls'). The paths vary in terms of the number and names of directories but are consistent in leading to an Excel file. This qualitative data is textual and follows a pattern that combines directory names and file names in a linear, slash-separated format.

### Summary for Output Column Data:

The output data extracts and isolates the file name (with extension) from the given input paths. Regardless of the length or structure of the input path, the output consistently presents only the file name, including its extension (.xls). This indicates a process of parsing the input strings to remove directory information and retain only the essential file identification component. The output is uniform in format, showcasing only the Excel file names without any directory paths. This simplification suggests a focus on the identity and type of files (in this case, Excel sheets) rather than their location in the file system.

### Relationship Between Input and Output:

The relationship between the input and output data is characterized by a transformation process that extracts specific information (the file name and extension) from a more complex string (the full file path). This process involves parsing the input paths, identifying the relevant part of the string (the file name and extension), and discarding the rest (the directory and subdirectory names). The transformation is consistent across all instances, indicating a systematic approach to isolating file names from their paths. This relationship highlights a focus on the identity of the files (as represented by their names and extensions) over their location or the structure of the directories in which they are stored. The process effectively simplifies the qualitative data from a detailed description of file locations to a concise identification of files, making it easier to understand or process the types of files being dealt with, without the need to consider their storage paths., and input as ['home/Excel/Sheet1.xls'] output is Sheet1.xls, input as ['home/user/Sheet1.xls'] output is Sheet1.xls, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
