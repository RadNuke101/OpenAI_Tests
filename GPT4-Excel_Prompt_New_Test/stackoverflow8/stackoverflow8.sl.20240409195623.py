Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Summary for Input Column Data:

The input data consists of file paths in a string format, each leading to a specific file. These paths are structured hierarchically, starting from a root directory (e.g., 'home') and potentially including multiple subdirectories (e.g., 'Excel', 'user') before reaching the target file (e.g., 'Sheet1.xls'). The file paths are diverse in their structure, indicating that the files reside in different directories or subdirectories. However, they all share a commonality in their format, ending with a file name and extension (e.g., '.xls'). The input data represents a qualitative dataset where each entry is a unique identifier of a file's location within a file system.

### Summary for Output Column Data:

The output data consists of file names with their extensions (e.g., 'Sheet1.xls'), extracted from the input file paths. This data is qualitative and represents the specific files of interest, disregarding their location within the file system. Each output entry corresponds directly to a file mentioned in the input data, focusing solely on the file's name and type (indicated by the extension) without considering its directory path. The output data is uniform in its structure, providing a simplified, consistent view of the files being referenced.

### Relationship Summary:

The relationship between the input and output data is a process of extraction and simplification, where the complex, hierarchical file paths provided in the input are distilled down to their most essential component: the file name and extension. This transformation strips away the contextual information about the file's location within the file system, focusing instead on identifying the file itself. The process highlights the specific files of interest from a broader context, making it easier to reference or manipulate these files without concern for their original directory structure. The relationship underscores a filtering or reduction operation, where the detailed, qualitative descriptions of file locations are refined to yield a concise, qualitative identification of each file., and input as ['home/Excel/Sheet1.xls'] output is Sheet1.xls, input as ['home/user/Sheet1.xls'] output is Sheet1.xls, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
