Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Summary of Input Column Data

The input data consists of two columns, each containing strings. The first column includes strings that are a mix of digits and, in some cases, letters and special characters. These strings vary in length and composition, indicating a diverse set of alphanumeric identifiers or codes. Examples include '1234', '**512A', and '343DMX', showcasing a range from purely numeric to mixed alphanumeric entries, with some entries also incorporating special characters like asterisks.

The second column contains single-digit numbers, such as '1', '2', and '3'. These numbers appear to serve as indicators or parameters that influence the transformation applied to the strings in the first column.

### Summary of Output Column Data

The output data is a single column that contains strings which are subsets of the corresponding strings in the first input column. The outputs, such as '234', '512A', and 'DMX', are derived by applying a certain operation to the first column's strings, guided by the values provided in the second column. These outputs retain the character composition of the original strings (i.e., numeric, alphanumeric, or including special characters) but are shortened versions, indicating a removal or exclusion process based on the second column's numbers.

### Relationship Between Input and Output

The relationship between the input columns and the output column suggests a systematic transformation process where the second input column's number dictates how many characters to exclude from the beginning of the first input column's string to generate the output. For instance, a '1' in the second column means removing the first character from the string in the first column, '2' means removing the first two characters, and so on. This process effectively shortens the original string, producing a new string that starts from a point in the original string determined by the numeric value in the second column.

In summary, the transformation from input to output involves a character exclusion operation based on a parameter provided in the second input column, resulting in a subset of the original string being retained in the output. This relationship highlights a method of generating variations of the original strings through a controlled, parameter-driven process., and input as ['1234', '1'] output is 234, input as ['**512A', '2'] output is 512A, input as ['343DMX', '3'] output is DMX, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
