Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Given the data and the task, we can summarize the relationship between the input and the output as follows:

### Input Column Summary:
The input data consists of strings formatted as three groups of three digits each, separated by hyphens (e.g., 'XXX-XXX-XXX'). Each entry in the input column is unique and appears to represent a specific code or identifier that is divided into three parts. The format is consistent across all entries, adhering to the pattern of having digits grouped and separated by hyphens.

### Output Column Summary:
The output data consists of the first group of three digits from the input data, extracted and presented as a standalone number (e.g., XXX). Each output is a unique integer that corresponds directly to the first segment of the associated input string. The output retains the numerical value of the input's first segment without any modifications or transformations beyond its extraction.

### Relationship Summary:
The relationship between the input and output data is straightforward and consistent: the output is derived directly from the input by extracting the first group of three digits. This process effectively isolates the initial segment of the input string, disregarding the remaining two segments. There is a one-to-one correspondence between each input string and its output number, with the output serving as a partial representation of the input. This relationship suggests that the most significant portion of the input data, for the purpose of this dataset, is the first group of digits, which could imply a hierarchical or prioritized structure within the data where the initial segment holds particular importance or relevance., and input as ['938-242-504'] output is 938, input as ['308-916-545'] output is 308, input as ['623-599-749'] output is 623, input as ['981-424-843'] output is 981, input as ['118-980-214'] output is 118, input as ['244-655-094'] output is 244, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
