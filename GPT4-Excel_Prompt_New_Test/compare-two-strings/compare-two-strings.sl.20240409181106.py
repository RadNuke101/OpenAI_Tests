Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Input Column Summary:

The input data consists of pairs of strings, each representing a type of fruit. These pairs are qualitative in nature and are used to compare two instances of fruit names. The comparison can involve case sensitivity, as the same fruit name with different cases (e.g., 'Orange' vs. 'orange') is present in the dataset. The variety of fruit names suggests a focus on common fruits but also includes an examination of how slight variations in the spelling or case of these names might affect the outcome.

### Output Column Summary:

The output data is binary (true or false), indicating whether the two input strings in each pair are considered equivalent under the criteria being applied. The true outcome suggests a match or equivalence between the pair of strings, while false indicates a discrepancy. This binary nature simplifies the analysis to a matter of matching versus non-matching pairs, which is directly influenced by the criteria used to evaluate the pairs (e.g., case sensitivity).

### Relationship Summary:

The relationship between the input pairs and the output can be summarized as follows:

- **Case Sensitivity**: The output appears to be sensitive to case differences. Pairs that are identical in terms of spelling but differ in case (e.g., 'orange' vs. 'Orange', 'cherry' vs. 'cherrY') result in a false output, indicating that the comparison method does not consider these pairs equivalent.
  
- **Exact Match Requirement**: For an output to be true, the strings in each pair must match exactly, including case. This suggests that the underlying comparison is strict and does not allow for any variations, whether they be in spelling or case.

- **Qualitative Comparison**: The nature of the data and the comparison is qualitative, focusing on the attributes (spelling and case) of the fruit names rather than any quantitative measures.

In summary, the relationship between the input pairs and the output demonstrates a strict comparison mechanism that requires exact matches, including case sensitivity, to consider the two strings in each pair equivalent. This highlights the importance of precision in the input data when aiming for a true equivalence outcome., and input as ['apple', 'apple'] output is true, input as ['orange', 'Orange'] output is false, input as ['peach', 'peach'] output is true, input as ['cherry', 'cherrY'] output is false, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
