Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Summary for Input Column Data:

The input data consists of two primary columns, each representing different types of information related to higher education institutions in the United States. The first column contains the names of universities or colleges, which include a mix of full names (e.g., "University of Pennsylvania") and abbreviations or informal names (e.g., "UCLA" for University of California, Los Angeles). This variety indicates that the dataset includes both formal and colloquial ways of referring to these institutions.

The second column provides the geographical locations of these institutions, but the format is not consistent across entries. Some locations are given with full state names and country (e.g., "Ithaca, New York, USA"), while others use state abbreviations without the country specified (e.g., "Los Angeles, CA"). This inconsistency suggests that the dataset does not adhere to a strict format for location information.

### Summary for Output Column Data:

The output data standardizes the location information provided in the second input column. It consistently uses city names followed by state abbreviations and concludes with "USA" to denote the country. This standardization process corrects any misspellings (e.g., "Phialdelphia" to "Philadelphia"), abbreviates state names (e.g., "New York" to "NY"), and adds "USA" where it was previously omitted. The output ensures uniformity in the presentation of location data, making it easier to understand and compare across entries.

### Relationship Summary:

The transformation from input to output demonstrates a process of standardization and correction of the geographical location data associated with various higher education institutions in the United States. The primary goal appears to be the creation of a consistent and error-free format for representing locations, which involves correcting spelling mistakes, abbreviating state names consistently, and ensuring the country name is present in all entries. This process does not alter the names of the institutions themselves but focuses solely on improving the clarity and consistency of the location information. The relationship between the input and output underscores the importance of standardized data formats for enhancing the readability and comparability of information across different entries in a dataset., and input as ['University of Pennsylvania', 'Phialdelphia, PA, USA'] output is Phialdelphia, PA, USA, input as ['UCLA', 'Los Angeles, CA'] output is Los Angeles, CA, USA, input as ['Cornell University', 'Ithaca, New York, USA'] output is Ithaca, NY, USA, input as ['Penn', 'Philadelphia, PA, USA'] output is Philadelphia, PA, USA, input as ['University of Maryland College Park', 'College Park, MD'] output is College Park, MD, USA, input as ['University of Michigan', 'Ann Arbor, MI, USA'] output is Ann Arbor, MI, USA, input as ['Columbia University', 'New York, NY, USA'] output is New York, NY, USA, input as ['NYU', 'New York, New York, USA'] output is New York, NY, USA, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
