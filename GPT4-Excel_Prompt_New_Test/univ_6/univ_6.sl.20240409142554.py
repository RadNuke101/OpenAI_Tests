Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Summary for Input Column Data

The input data consists of two primary columns, with each row representing a specific university or college and its corresponding location. The first column includes the full names of universities or abbreviations, such as "University of Pennsylvania," "UCLA," "Cornell University," "Penn," "University of Maryland College Park," "University of Michigan," "Columbia University," and "NYU." This column reflects a variety of institutions, ranging from Ivy League universities to public state universities, showcasing a broad spectrum of higher education establishments across the United States.

The second column provides the geographical locations of these institutions, including the city and state, with some entries also including the country ("USA"). The locations span across various states such as Pennsylvania, California, New York, Maryland, and Michigan, indicating a wide geographical distribution of these institutions within the United States. Some entries in this column have minor inconsistencies in formatting, such as variations in the use of abbreviations for states and the inclusion or exclusion of "USA."

### Summary for Output Column Data

The output data standardizes the location information provided in the second input column, focusing on consistency in formatting and the inclusion of the country ("USA") when it's not originally mentioned. The state names are abbreviated uniformly, and "USA" is appended to each entry if not already present. This standardization process simplifies the geographical information, making it more concise and easier to understand at a glance. The output retains the essential location details (city, state abbreviation, and country) for each institution, ensuring clarity and uniformity across all entries.

### Relationship Between Input and Output

The transformation from input to output demonstrates a process of standardization and clarification of geographical information associated with various universities and colleges in the United States. The first input column serves to identify the institution, while the second column's geographical details are refined in the output to adhere to a consistent format. This process involves correcting spelling errors (e.g., "Phialdelphia" to "Philadelphia"), standardizing state abbreviations, and ensuring the country ("USA") is explicitly mentioned for clarity, especially for an international audience. The relationship between the input and output underscores the importance of clear, standardized location information in conveying the geographical context of these institutions, facilitating easier comprehension and comparison across different entries., and input as ['University of Pennsylvania', 'Phialdelphia, PA, USA'] output is Phialdelphia, PA, USA, input as ['UCLA', 'Los Angeles, CA'] output is Los Angeles, CA, USA, input as ['Cornell University', 'Ithaca, New York, USA'] output is Ithaca, NY, USA, input as ['Penn', 'Philadelphia, PA, USA'] output is Philadelphia, PA, USA, input as ['University of Maryland College Park', 'College Park, MD'] output is College Park, MD, USA, input as ['University of Michigan', 'Ann Arbor, MI, USA'] output is Ann Arbor, MI, USA, input as ['Columbia University', 'New York, NY, USA'] output is New York, NY, USA, input as ['NYU', 'New York, New York, USA'] output is New York, NY, USA, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
