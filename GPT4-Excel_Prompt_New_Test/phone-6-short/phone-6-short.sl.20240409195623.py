Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Summary of Input Column Data

The input data consists of strings that follow a specific format, which can be broken down into three distinct parts:

1. **Country Code Prefix**: This is a '+' sign followed by a series of digits. The number of digits varies, indicating the country code. This part of the string does not seem to influence the output directly, as it varies widely across the inputs and does not correlate with the output.

2. **First Number Block**: Following the country code, there is a space, and then a series of digits. This block of digits is the focus for the output. It varies in length but is always separated from the subsequent parts by a space.

3. **Remaining Number Blocks**: After the first number block, there are additional blocks of digits separated by hyphens. These blocks do not influence the output and seem to serve as additional information following the key output-related block.

The input data is qualitative in nature, with the structure and placement of digits within the string being more significant than the numerical value of the digits themselves.

### Summary of Output Column Data

The output data extracts and isolates a specific part of the input data:

- **Extracted Block**: The output consistently corresponds to the first block of digits that immediately follows the country code prefix in the input. This block is extracted in its entirety, including leading zeros where present.

- **Qualitative Nature**: The output is qualitative, representing a specific segment of the input string rather than a numerical value derived from calculations or transformations.

### Relationship Between Input and Output

The relationship between the input and output data is defined by a structured extraction process. The output is always the first block of digits that follows the country code prefix in the input string. This process ignores the country code itself and any digits that follow the first hyphen, focusing solely on the segment of the string that directly follows the country code and precedes any other separators (like hyphens).

This relationship indicates a rule-based extraction rather than a transformation or calculation, emphasizing the importance of the structure and placement of data within the input string over the numerical value of the data itself. The process treats the input as a source of qualitative data, where the meaning is derived from the format and order of elements within the string rather than their quantitative value., and input as ['+106 769-858-438'] output is 769, input as ['+83 973-757-831'] output is 973, input as ['+62 647-787-775'] output is 647, input as ['+172 027-507-632'] output is 027, input as ['+72 001-050-856'] output is 001, input as ['+95 310-537-401'] output is 310, input as ['+6 775-969-238'] output is 775, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
