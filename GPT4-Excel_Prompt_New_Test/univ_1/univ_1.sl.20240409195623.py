Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Input Column Summary:

The input data consists of two primary columns, each containing distinct but related pieces of information about various universities and colleges across the United States. The first column lists the names of these institutions, which include a mix of well-known universities (such as "University of Pennsylvania," "Cornell University," "MIT," "Harvard University") and colleges, encompassing both public and private entities, as well as a range of sizes and geographic locations. The names vary from full official titles to more colloquial or abbreviated forms (e.g., "Penn," "UCLA," "NYU," "UC Berkeley"). The second column provides the specific location of each institution, including the city and state, with some entries also including the country ("USA") for additional clarity. This column highlights the diverse geographic distribution of these institutions across various states such as Pennsylvania, California, New York, Michigan, and more, indicating a wide representation of the American higher education landscape.

### Output Column Summary:

The output data consolidates the information provided in the two input columns into a single, cohesive format. Each entry in the output column combines the name of the institution from the first input column with its corresponding location from the second input column, separated by a comma. This format provides a clear and concise way to present the full name and location of each institution in a standardized manner. The output retains the original naming conventions and location details as provided in the input, ensuring that the information remains accurate and recognizable. This unified format is beneficial for quickly understanding the specific institution being referred to and its geographical context, which could be useful for various purposes such as academic research, student applications, or general informational needs.

### Relationship Summary:

The relationship between the input and the output columns is a transformation process that merges the separate pieces of information (institution name and location) from the input columns into a single, streamlined output. This process involves concatenating the name of the institution with its location, using a comma as a separator, without altering the original text. The transformation maintains the integrity and specificity of the input data while making it more accessible and easier to comprehend in a single glance. This method of data presentation is particularly effective for databases, directories, or listings where space is limited, and clarity is paramount. The relationship underscores the importance of clear, concise information presentation in academic and geographic contexts., and input as ['University of Pennsylvania', 'Phialdelphia, PA, USA'] output is University of Pennsylvania, Phialdelphia, PA, USA, input as ['UCLA', 'Los Angeles, CA'] output is UCLA, Los Angeles, CA, input as ['Cornell University', 'Ithaca, New York, USA'] output is Cornell University, Ithaca, New York, USA, input as ['Penn', 'Philadelphia, PA, USA'] output is Penn, Philadelphia, PA, USA, input as ['University of Maryland College Park', 'College Park, MD'] output is University of Maryland College Park, College Park, MD, input as ['University of Michigan', 'Ann Arbor, MI, USA'] output is University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA, input as ['UC Berkeley', 'Berkeley, CA'] output is UC Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, input as ['MIT', 'Cambridge, MA'] output is MIT, Cambridge, MA, input as ['Rice University', 'Houston, TX'] output is Rice University, Houston, TX, input as ['Yale University', 'New Haven, CT, USA'] output is Yale University, New Haven, CT, USA, input as ['Columbia University', 'New York, NY, USA'] output is Columbia University, New York, NY, USA, input as ['NYU', 'New York, New York, USA'] output is NYU, New York, New York, USA, input as ['UC Berkeley', 'Berkeley, CA'] output is UC Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, input as ['UIUC', 'Urbana, IL'] output is UIUC, Urbana, IL, input as ['Temple University', 'Philadelphia, PA'] output is Temple University, Philadelphia, PA, input as ['Harvard University', 'Cambridge, MA, USA'] output is Harvard University, Cambridge, MA, USA, input as ['University of Connecticut', 'Storrs, CT, USA'] output is University of Connecticut, Storrs, CT, USA, input as ['Drexel University', 'Philadelphia, PA'] output is Drexel University, Philadelphia, PA, input as ['New Haven University', 'New Haven, CT, USA'] output is New Haven University, New Haven, CT, USA, input as ['University of California, Santa Barbara', 'Santa Barbara, CA, USA'] output is University of California, Santa Barbara, Santa Barbara, CA, USA, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
