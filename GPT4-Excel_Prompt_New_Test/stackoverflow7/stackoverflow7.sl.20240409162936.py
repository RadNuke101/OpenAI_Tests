Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Input Column Summary:

The input data consists of two columns, each containing strings that represent items, presumably watches, given the nature of the identifiers involved. The first column appears to contain a more detailed description of the items, including a model identifier followed by a specific version or variant code. The second column provides a more generalized identifier, which seems to be a subset of the information provided in the first column, focusing primarily on the model identifier without the additional version or variant code.

### Output Column Summary:

The output data is a single column that appears to distill the relationship between the two input columns into a concise identifier or descriptor. This output seems to focus on extracting the unique or distinguishing information from the first column that is not explicitly stated in the second column. In cases where the second column fully matches a portion of the first column, the output is simply a descriptive label (e.g., "Item 1"). In cases where the first column contains additional information not captured by the second column, the output isolates and presents this additional information (e.g., "-1DUQ").

### Relationship Summary:

The relationship between the input columns and the output column can be summarized as a process of differentiation and extraction. The goal appears to be to identify and extract the unique or distinguishing information from the first input column that is not already captured by the second input column. This process allows for a concise representation of what makes each item in the first column unique when compared to the generalized identifier provided in the second column. The output serves as a distilled identifier that highlights these differences or, in their absence, reaffirms the item's identity as presented in the first column. This method could be particularly useful in contexts where there is a need to quickly identify differences or specific versions/variations of items based on their identifiers., and input as ['Item 1 AQ-S810W-2AVDF', 'AQ-S810W-2AVDF'] output is Item 1, input as ['Item 2 AQ-230A-1DUQ', 'AQ-230A'] output is Item 2 -1DUQ, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
