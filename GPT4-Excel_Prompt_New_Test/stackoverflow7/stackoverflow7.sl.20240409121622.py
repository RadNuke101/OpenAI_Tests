Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Input Column Summary:

The input data consists of two columns, each containing strings that represent items, specifically models of products. The first column includes a more detailed description of the items, combining a name or identifier (e.g., "Item 1", "Item 2") followed by a specific model code (e.g., "AQ-S810W-2AVDF", "AQ-230A-1DUQ"). The second column presents a subset of the information found in the first column, focusing primarily on the model code but often in a less detailed form. This suggests that the first column provides a more comprehensive identification of the items, including both a general identifier and a specific model code, while the second column narrows the focus to primarily the model code, sometimes omitting certain details.

### Output Column Summary:

The output data is a transformation of the input data, specifically derived from the first column of the input. It appears to retain the general identifier (e.g., "Item 1", "Item 2") but modifies the model code information based on the comparison with the second input column. When the model code in the first column matches exactly with the second column, the output retains the general identifier only (e.g., "Item 1"). However, when there is a discrepancy or additional detail in the model code of the first column compared to the second, the output modifies the identifier to reflect this difference, either by omitting the additional detail found in the first column or by highlighting the discrepancy (e.g., "Item 2 -1DUQ").

### Relationship Summary:

The relationship between the input and output data involves a process of comparison and condensation of information. The transformation process seems to analyze the level of detail in the model codes between the two input columns. When the model code in the first column is exactly replicated in the second column, the output simplifies to just the general identifier, indicating a direct match. Conversely, when there is additional detail in the model code of the first column that is not captured in the second column, the output reflects this by either omitting the extra detail or by specifically highlighting the discrepancy. This suggests that the output is designed to succinctly communicate how the detailed model code in the first column compares to the more general or less detailed model code in the second column, focusing on the presence or absence of specific details., and input as ['Item 1 AQ-S810W-2AVDF', 'AQ-S810W-2AVDF'] output is Item 1, input as ['Item 2 AQ-230A-1DUQ', 'AQ-230A'] output is Item 2 -1DUQ, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
