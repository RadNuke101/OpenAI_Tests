Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Input Column Summary

The input data consists of two columns, each containing strings that represent items and their model specifications. The first column includes a more descriptive label of the item, combining a general identifier (e.g., "Item 1", "Item 2") with a specific model code (e.g., "AQ-S810W-2AVDF", "AQ-230A-1DUQ"). This model code is a combination of letters and numbers that likely represents the product's series, model, and variant. The second column presents a simplified or partial version of the model code found in the first column, omitting certain details such as variant identifiers or additional specifications.

### Output Column Summary

The output data simplifies or extracts specific information from the first input column based on the comparison with the second input column. When the model code in the second column matches the beginning of the model code in the first column, the output retains the general item identifier (e.g., "Item 1", "Item 2") and appends any additional variant or specification details from the first column that are not present in the second column. This process effectively highlights the unique or distinguishing features of the item's model code that are not captured by the simplified model code in the second column.

### Relationship Summary

The relationship between the input and output columns is characterized by a process of comparison and extraction. The transformation from input to output involves identifying the common base (the model code) between the two input columns and then extracting or retaining the elements that are unique to the more detailed description in the first column. This operation serves to distill the essential differences or additional specifications of the items beyond what is captured by the simplified model codes in the second column. Essentially, the output provides a concise way to understand what specific variant or additional features (if any) are associated with each item, as indicated by the differences between the detailed and simplified model codes. This process allows for a quick identification of the unique aspects of each item's model, facilitating easier reference or comparison based on those unique identifiers or specifications., and input as ['Item 1 AQ-S810W-2AVDF', 'AQ-S810W-2AVDF'] output is Item 1, input as ['Item 2 AQ-230A-1DUQ', 'AQ-230A'] output is Item 2 -1DUQ, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
