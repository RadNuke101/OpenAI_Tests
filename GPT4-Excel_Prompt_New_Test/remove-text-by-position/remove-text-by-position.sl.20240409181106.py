Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Summary for Input Column Data:

The input data consists of strings that represent file paths. Each string is structured to include a drive letter (in this case, 'c'), followed by a sequence of directories ('/users/dave/'), and finally, the name of a file with its extension ('.xls'). The files mentioned in the examples are related to spreadsheet operations, as indicated by the '.xls' extension, which is commonly associated with Microsoft Excel files. The file names ('shotcut.xls', 'formulas.xls', 'pivot table.xls') suggest that these files contain specific types of data or functions related to spreadsheet use, such as shortcuts, formulas, or pivot table information. The paths are absolute, providing a complete reference to the file's location on the system.

### Summary for Output Column Data:

The output data consists of the names of the files, including their extensions, extracted from the input paths. These names ('shotcut.xls', 'formulas.xls', 'pivot table.xls') directly correspond to the final segment of each input path, indicating that the output is focused solely on identifying the file name, disregarding the file's location within the system's directory structure. The output retains the original file name and extension, preserving the context of the file type (.xls) and its potential content or function.

### Relationship Summary:

The relationship between the input and output data is a process of extraction, where the output is derived by isolating the final segment (the file name and extension) of the input path. This process effectively removes the directory path, focusing only on the identity of the file itself. The transformation from input to output demonstrates a filtering operation where the specific location of the file within the system's directories is deemed irrelevant for the output's purpose, and only the file's name and type are retained. This suggests that the operation's primary interest lies in identifying or cataloging the files by name, rather than understanding their location within the user's directory structure., and input as ['c=/users/dave/shotcut.xls'] output is shotcut.xls, input as ['c=/users/dave/formulas.xls'] output is formulas.xls, input as ['c=/users/dave/pivot table.xls'] output is pivot table.xls, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
