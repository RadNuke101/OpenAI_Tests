Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Input Column Summary:

The input data consists of two columns. The first column contains a consistent string pattern 'zx66448' across all entries, indicating a fixed reference point for the transformation process. The second column varies with single-character entries ('z', 'x', '6', '4', '8'), each representing a specific character to be targeted for an operation within the context of the transformation applied to the first column's string.

### Output Column Summary:

The output data demonstrates the result of a transformation applied to the string from the first input column, based on the character specified in the second input column. The transformation involves removing occurrences of the specified character from the original string. The output varies depending on the character targeted for removal, illustrating different possible outcomes ('x66448', 'z66448', 'zx448', 'zx668', 'zx6644') from the operation.

### Relationship Summary:

The relationship between the input and output columns is defined by a character removal operation. The first input column provides a constant string that serves as the base for the transformation. The second input column specifies the character to be removed from this base string. The output column reflects the result of this operation, showcasing the base string with the specified character(s) removed. This process highlights a direct manipulation based on character targeting within a string, where the nature of the output is directly influenced by the character identified for removal in the second input column., and input as ['zx66448', 'z'] output is x66448, input as ['zx66448', 'x'] output is z66448, input as ['zx66448', '6'] output is zx448, input as ['zx66448', '4'] output is zx668, input as ['zx66448', '8'] output is zx6644, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
