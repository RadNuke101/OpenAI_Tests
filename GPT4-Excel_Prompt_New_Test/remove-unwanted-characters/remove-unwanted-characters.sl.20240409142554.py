Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Input Column Summary:

The input data consists of two distinct parts:

1. **Initial String**: The first part of the input is a constant string 'zx66448' across all examples. This string serves as the base from which transformations are made based on the second part of the input.
   
2. **Character to Remove**: The second part of the input varies across examples and specifies a character to be removed from the initial string. This character is represented as a single character string and includes 'z', 'x', '6', '4', and '8'. 

These inputs suggest a relationship where the operation to be performed is the removal of specified characters from a base string.

### Output Column Summary:

The output data demonstrates the result of removing the specified character (from the second part of the input) from the initial string 'zx66448'. Each output is unique to the character specified for removal and shows the initial string with all instances of that character removed. The outputs are as follows:

- Removing 'z' results in 'x66448'.
- Removing 'x' results in 'z66448'.
- Removing '6' results in 'zx448'.
- Removing '4' results in 'zx668'.
- Removing '8' results in 'zx6644'.

### Relationship Summary:

The relationship between the input and output data is a direct mapping of a character removal operation from a base string. The first part of the input acts as a constant base string, while the second part specifies the character to be removed from this base string. The output is the result of this operation, showcasing the base string with the specified character(s) removed. This operation is consistent across all examples, indicating a clear, rule-based transformation from input to output. The process does not alter the order of the remaining characters and removes all instances of the specified character, demonstrating a simple yet specific string manipulation operation., and input as ['zx66448', 'z'] output is x66448, input as ['zx66448', 'x'] output is z66448, input as ['zx66448', '6'] output is zx448, input as ['zx66448', '4'] output is zx668, input as ['zx66448', '8'] output is zx6644, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
