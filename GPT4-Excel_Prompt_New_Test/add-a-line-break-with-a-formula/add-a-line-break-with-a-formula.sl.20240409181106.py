Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Input Column Data Summary

1. **Name (First Column):** The first column contains full names of individuals, which include both first and last names. These names are diverse, representing different genders and potentially different ethnic backgrounds. The names serve as identifiers for the individuals associated with the addresses provided in the subsequent columns.

2. **Street Address (Second Column):** The second column lists street addresses, which include house numbers followed by the name of the street. These addresses are specific to the residences or locations of the individuals named in the first column. The format is consistent, providing a clear indication of the physical location of each person's residence or place of interest.

3. **City, State, and ZIP Code (Third Column):** The third column provides additional details about the location, including the city, state abbreviation, and ZIP code. This information complements the street address by situating it within a broader geographical context, making it possible to pinpoint the exact location within the United States.

### Output Column Data Summary

The output column combines the information from the three input columns into a single, structured format. Each entry in the output column is a concatenation of the corresponding row's data from the input columns, separated by "/n" to denote new lines. This format effectively transforms the tabular data into a block of text that preserves the logical separation of name, street address, and city/state/ZIP code, albeit in a more compact and linear form. The output is designed to present all relevant information about an individual's location in a format that is both readable and easily processed, whether by humans or machines.

### Relationship Between Input and Output

The transformation from input to output columns represents a process of data consolidation and formatting. The relationship between the input and output is characterized by the reorganization of discrete pieces of information (name, street address, city/state/ZIP) into a unified string that maintains the integrity and sequence of the original data. This process does not alter the content of the data but changes its presentation to suit different purposes, such as display in environments where a linear, text-based format is preferred over a tabular representation. The use of "/n" as a line separator in the output is a key aspect of this transformation, indicating where line breaks should occur if the data were to be displayed in a multi-line format. This method ensures that the essential elements of each individual's location information are kept intact and clearly delineated within the consolidated output., and input as ['Traci Brown', '1301 Robinson Court', 'Saginaw, MI 48607'] output is Traci Brown/n1301 Robinson Court/nSaginaw, MI 48607, input as ['Mary Hannan', '1195 Amethyst Drive', 'Lansing, MI 48933'] output is Mary Hannan/n1195 Amethyst Drive/nLansing, MI 48933, input as ['Linda Thomas', '2479 North Bend Road', 'Allen, KY 41601'] output is Linda Thomas/n2479 North Bend Road/nAllen, KY 41601, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
