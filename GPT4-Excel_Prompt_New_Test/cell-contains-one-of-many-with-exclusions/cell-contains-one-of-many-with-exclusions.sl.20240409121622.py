Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Input Column Summary:

The input data consists of four columns. The first column contains phrases that describe objects or scenes with specific colors and sometimes additional descriptive elements (e.g., "yellow dog on green grass"). The subsequent three columns list individual words, which are generally colors or descriptive terms (e.g., "yellow", "green", "cat").

1. **First Column (Phrases):** Descriptions that often include colors and sometimes an object or a descriptive term. These phrases seem to set a scene or describe an item in a visually descriptive manner.
   
2. **Second to Fourth Columns (Individual Words):** These columns contain individual words that are primarily colors but can also include descriptive terms or objects. Each of these columns seems to represent a specific attribute that could be found within the phrases of the first column.

### Output Column Summary:

The output data is a binary (true/false) value. It appears to indicate whether there is a match or a specific relationship between the words listed in the second to fourth columns and the phrase in the first column of the same row.

### Relationship Summary:

The relationship between the input and the output seems to be based on the presence of the words from the second to fourth columns within the phrase in the first column. Specifically, the output is true if:

1. **At least one of the colors** mentioned in the second or third columns is present in the phrase.
2. **The descriptive term or object** mentioned in the fourth column does not necessarily need to be present for the output to be true.

This suggests that the primary condition for the output to be true is the presence of at least one of the specified colors in the phrase. The presence of the descriptive term or object from the fourth column does not seem to be a strict requirement for the output to be true, indicating that the emphasis is on the colors rather than on any specific objects or additional descriptive terms mentioned., and input as ['yellow dog on green grass', 'yellow', 'green', 'cat'] output is true, input as ['warm gray sweater', 'yellow', 'green', 'cat'] output is false, input as ['blue neon signs', 'blue', 'green', 'neon'] output is false, input as ['hot pink socks', 'blue', 'pink', 'neon'] output is true, input as ['deep black eyes', 'yellow', 'green', 'neon'] output is false, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
