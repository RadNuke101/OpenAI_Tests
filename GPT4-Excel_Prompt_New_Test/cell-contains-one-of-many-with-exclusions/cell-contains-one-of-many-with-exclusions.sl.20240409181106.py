Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Input Column Summary:

The input data consists of four columns. The first column contains phrases describing objects with specific colors and sometimes additional descriptive elements (e.g., "yellow dog on green grass"). The next three columns list individual words, which seem to be colors or descriptive elements (e.g., "yellow", "green", "cat").

1. **First Column (Phrases):** Descriptions involving colors and sometimes additional attributes or objects.
2. **Second Column (Word 1):** Primarily colors, possibly indicating a key color to be identified in the first column.
3. **Third Column (Word 2):** Also mainly colors, suggesting another color or attribute to be identified.
4. **Fourth Column (Word 3):** Contains both colors and other descriptive words, indicating a mix of attributes or objects to be identified.

### Output Column Summary:

The output is a binary value (true or false) that seems to correlate with the presence or absence of specific criteria being met within the phrases of the first column, based on the words listed in the subsequent three columns.

### Relationship Summary:

The output appears to be determined by the presence of specific criteria within the first column's phrases, as influenced by the words in the next three columns. The criteria for an output of "true" seem to involve:

1. **Presence of Colors/Attributes:** At least one of the colors or attributes listed in the second and third columns must be present in the phrase.
2. **Specific Combinations or Exclusions:** The presence of the word in the fourth column might not necessarily dictate the output directly but could influence the outcome based on its presence or absence in conjunction with the other words.

For example, when the phrase contains colors or attributes listed in the second and third columns, and possibly considers the relevance of the fourth column's word, the output is "true". If the phrase lacks these elements or the specific combination does not meet the criteria, the output is "false".

In summary, the relationship between the input and output is determined by a set of rules that consider the presence of specific colors or attributes within the phrases, as indicated by the words in the second to fourth columns. The exact nature of these rules might involve combinations of presence/absence and specific pairings of the listed words with the content of the phrases., and input as ['yellow dog on green grass', 'yellow', 'green', 'cat'] output is true, input as ['warm gray sweater', 'yellow', 'green', 'cat'] output is false, input as ['blue neon signs', 'blue', 'green', 'neon'] output is false, input as ['hot pink socks', 'blue', 'pink', 'neon'] output is true, input as ['deep black eyes', 'yellow', 'green', 'neon'] output is false, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
