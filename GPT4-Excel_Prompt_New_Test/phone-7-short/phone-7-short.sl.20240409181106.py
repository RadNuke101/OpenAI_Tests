Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Summary of Input Column Data

The input data consists of strings that follow a specific pattern characterized by a combination of country codes, spaces, and hyphen-separated numbers. Each string begins with a '+' sign followed by a country code of varying lengths (one to three digits). After the country code, there is a space, followed by a sequence of three groups of numbers separated by hyphens. The first group appears to be of three digits, the second group also consists of three digits, and the third group is of three digits as well, making it a consistent pattern across all inputs. The numbers within these groups vary across the inputs, indicating no apparent numerical pattern or sequence that correlates with the country code or any other part of the input.

### Summary of Output Column Data

The output data extracted from each input string is consistently the second group of numbers from the hyphen-separated sequence in the input. This group always consists of three digits. The range of numbers in the output does not follow a specific numerical sequence or pattern that can be directly associated with the country code or any other part of the input string. The output numbers vary widely, from as low as '050' to as high as '969', showing no clear correlation with the input's country code or the first and third groups of numbers.

### Relationship Between Input and Output

The relationship between the input and output data is straightforward and consistent across all examples: the output is always the second group of three digits from the hyphen-separated sequence in the input string. This extraction process ignores the country code and the other two groups of numbers, focusing solely on the middle group for the output. The input data's structure (country code, space, and hyphen-separated numbers) serves as a template from which the output is reliably derived, indicating a qualitative relationship based on the position of the number groups within the input string rather than any quantitative or numerical relationship between the values of the input and the output., and input as ['+106 769-858-438'] output is 858, input as ['+83 973-757-831'] output is 757, input as ['+62 647-787-775'] output is 787, input as ['+172 027-507-632'] output is 507, input as ['+72 001-050-856'] output is 050, input as ['+95 310-537-401'] output is 537, input as ['+6 775-969-238'] output is 969, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
