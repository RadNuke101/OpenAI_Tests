Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Input Column Summary:

The input column data consists of strings that are a mix of alphanumeric characters. These strings appear to follow a pattern where numbers and text are combined, but the specific arrangement can vary. The numbers can be at the beginning, in the middle, or even represent a value (like a price) within the sentence. The textual part of these strings includes names, items, or descriptions. The diversity in the structure of these strings suggests that the input data could be coming from a dataset that includes identifiers (like ID numbers or prices) followed by descriptive text (such as names, items, or conditions).

### Output Column Summary:

The output column data retains only the textual part of the input strings, with all numeric characters removed. This suggests that the transformation process involves extracting or isolating the textual information from the mixed-format input. The output is purely qualitative, focusing on the descriptive aspect of the input data. It appears that the process aims to clean the input data by removing numerical values, leaving behind text that could be names, descriptions, or items without their associated quantities or identifiers.

### Relationship Summary:

The relationship between the input and output columns is characterized by a filtering or extraction process where the goal is to separate textual information from numerical data. This process can be seen as a form of data cleaning or preparation, where the output is more focused on qualitative aspects by removing quantitative elements. The transformation suggests that the purpose of the output data might be for contexts where the textual description is more relevant than the numerical values, such as in qualitative analysis, text-based processing, or when preparing data for applications where identifiers and quantities are not needed. This relationship highlights a common data preprocessing step where the nature of the analysis or the requirements of the downstream application dictate the removal of certain types of information (in this case, numbers) to refine the dataset for specific uses., and input as ['34653 jim mcdonald'] output is  jim mcdonald, input as ['price is 500'] output is  price is , input as ['100 apples'] output is  apples, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
