Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Summary for Input Column Data:

The input data appears to be a mix of alphanumeric strings that combine numbers with text. These strings vary in their structure, with some beginning with numbers followed by text, others embedding numbers within the text, and some consisting solely of text with numerical values. The numbers could represent identifiers, quantities, or prices, while the text provides context, names, or descriptions. The diversity in the structure of these strings suggests that the input data could be coming from a variety of sources or fields, such as inventory lists, transaction records, or identification databases.

### Summary for Output Column Data:

The output data retains only the textual component from the input data, systematically excluding any numerical figures that were present. This process transforms the input by removing numerical values, whether they are standalone or embedded within the text, leaving behind only the textual information. The output thus focuses on the qualitative aspects of the input data, emphasizing names, descriptions, or statements devoid of their quantitative elements.

### Relationship Between Input and Output:

The transformation from input to output data reveals a clear relationship characterized by the selective exclusion of numerical data to retain only the textual content. This process suggests a deliberate focus on qualitative information over quantitative details. The relationship indicates that the purpose of this transformation is to isolate and highlight the textual or descriptive elements of the input data, possibly for tasks or analyses where numerical values are irrelevant or where the emphasis is on understanding or categorizing the data based on text content alone. This could be particularly useful in contexts where the meaning or identity conveyed by the text is more significant than the numerical values, such as in qualitative research, textual analysis, or when preparing data for systems that process natural language., and input as ['34653 jim mcdonald'] output is  jim mcdonald, input as ['price is 500'] output is  price is , input as ['100 apples'] output is  apples, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
