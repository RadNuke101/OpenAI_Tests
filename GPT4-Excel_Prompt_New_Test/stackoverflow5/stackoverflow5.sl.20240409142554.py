Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Input Column Summary:

The input data appears to be a string that contains multiple pieces of information separated by equal signs (`=`) and commas. The structure of the input data suggests a pattern where each entry starts with a descriptive title or name, followed by a series of values separated by equal signs. These values could represent various attributes or parameters related to the initial title or name. The presence of numbers and potentially dates (e.g., 1915, 1914) suggests that the data might include historical or quantitative information. The titles or names at the beginning (e.g., "valentine day", "movie blah=2blahblah, The") seem to be the primary identifiers for each entry, with the subsequent data providing additional details or specifications.

### Output Column Summary:

The output data extracts and presents the initial descriptive title or name from each input entry, discarding the rest of the information that follows in the input. This process simplifies the complex and detailed input into a more straightforward and readable format, focusing solely on the primary identifier of each entry. The output, therefore, serves as a distilled version of the input, highlighting the main subject or topic without delving into the specifics or attributes that accompany it.

### Relationship Summary:

The relationship between the input and output data is characterized by a filtration or extraction process, where the output is derived by isolating a specific portion of the input data. Specifically, the output captures the initial descriptive title or name from each input entry, effectively summarizing or representing the entry in a more concise form. This relationship indicates a focus on identifying and highlighting the key subjects or topics within a broader set of information, allowing for easier recognition and categorization of the data. The transformation from input to output simplifies the data, making it more accessible and understandable by removing extraneous details and emphasizing the primary identifiers. This process is particularly useful in contexts where the essence or main idea of the data is more important than the comprehensive details or when a quick overview or categorization is desired., and input as ['valentine day=1915=50==7.1=45'] output is valentine day, input as ['movie blah=2blahblah, The=1914=54==7.9=17'] output is movie blah=2blahblah, The, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
