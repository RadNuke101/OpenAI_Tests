Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Input Column Summary:

The input data appears to be a structured string containing multiple pieces of information separated by equal signs ('=') and commas (','). Each entry seems to follow a pattern where it starts with a descriptive title or name, which could be related to events, movies, or other categories, followed by a series of values that are likely associated with specific attributes of the item described at the beginning. The structure suggests a format where the first part is a textual description, and the subsequent parts are numerical or coded values, possibly representing dates, ratings, counts, or other metrics. The presence of multiple equal signs and the occasional comma indicate a complex structure that might include nested or hierarchical data.

### Output Column Summary:

The output data extracted from the input strings is the initial descriptive title or name part of each entry. This suggests that the output is focused on identifying or highlighting the primary subject or topic of each input string, removing the additional, more detailed numerical or coded information that follows in the input. The output serves to simplify or distill the input data to its most basic and identifiable component, which is the name or title that presumably gives context to the rest of the data in each entry.

### Relationship Between Input and Output:

The relationship between the input and output data is one of simplification and extraction. The process involves taking a complex and detailed input string and distilling it down to its most essential and descriptive part, which is the name or title at the beginning of each entry. This transformation strips away the detailed metrics and values that follow the title in the input, focusing solely on the initial descriptive element. This suggests a prioritization of qualitative identification over quantitative analysis, as the output seeks to capture the essence or main subject of each entry without delving into the specifics of the data that accompanies it. The output effectively serves as a summary or headline for the input, providing a clear and concise representation of each entry's primary focus or topic., and input as ['valentine day=1915=50==7.1=45'] output is valentine day, input as ['movie blah=2blahblah, The=1914=54==7.9=17'] output is movie blah=2blahblah, The, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
