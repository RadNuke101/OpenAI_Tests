Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Input Column Summary:

The input data consists of two columns, each containing specific information about various educational institutions in the United States. The first column lists the names of the institutions, which include a mix of full university names (e.g., "University of Pennsylvania", "Cornell University") and abbreviations or informal names (e.g., "UCLA", "Penn"). The second column provides the geographical location of these institutions, including the city and state. In some instances, the country "USA" is also included, while in others, it is omitted. This variation in detail suggests a need for standardization in how location information is presented.

### Output Column Summary:

The output data consolidates the information from the two input columns into a single, standardized format. Each entry combines the institution's name with its geographical location, separated by a comma. Notably, if the country "USA" was omitted in the input, it is systematically added in the output, ensuring consistency across all entries. This standardization facilitates easier understanding and uniformity in how the educational institutions' names and locations are presented, making it clear that all listed institutions are located in the United States.

### Relationship Between Input and Output:

The transformation from input to output demonstrates a process of standardization and consolidation of information regarding educational institutions and their locations. The output ensures that each institution's name is followed by a complete and standardized geographical location, including the addition of "USA" where it was previously missing. This process enhances the clarity and consistency of the data, making it more accessible and useful for various purposes, such as academic research, informational databases, or geographical analysis of educational institutions in the United States. The relationship between the input and output underscores the importance of data standardization, especially when dealing with qualitative information that may initially lack uniformity in presentation., and input as ['University of Pennsylvania', 'Phialdelphia, PA, USA'] output is University of Pennsylvania, Phialdelphia, PA, USA, input as ['UCLA', 'Los Angeles, CA'] output is UCLA, Los Angeles, CA, USA, input as ['Cornell University', 'Ithaca, New York, USA'] output is Cornell University, Ithaca, New York, USA, input as ['Penn', 'Philadelphia, PA, USA'] output is Penn, Philadelphia, PA, USA, input as ['University of Maryland College Park', 'College Park, MD'] output is University of Maryland College Park, College Park, MD, USA, input as ['University of Michigan', 'Ann Arbor, MI, USA'] output is University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.

def generated_function(institution_name, location):
    """
    This function takes the name of an educational institution and its geographical location as inputs,
    and returns a standardized string combining both pieces of information. If the location does not
    already include "USA", it is added to ensure consistency.

    Parameters:
    institution_name (str): The name of the educational institution.
    location (str): The geographical location of the institution.

    Returns:
    str: A standardized string combining the institution's name and its location, with "USA" added if missing.
