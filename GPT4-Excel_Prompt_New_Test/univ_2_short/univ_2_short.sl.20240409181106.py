Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Summary of Input Column Data:

The input data consists of two columns, each representing distinct but related pieces of information about various educational institutions in the United States. The first column contains the names of universities or colleges, which vary from well-known public research universities to private Ivy League institutions. These names include both formal names (e.g., "University of Pennsylvania") and informal or abbreviated names (e.g., "Penn", "UCLA"). The second column provides the geographical location of these institutions, specifying the city and state. In some instances, the country ("USA") is also included, while in others, it is omitted. This variation suggests a lack of consistency in how geographical information is presented. The data covers a range of locations, from large cities like Los Angeles, California, to smaller towns like Ithaca, New York, indicating a diverse geographical distribution of these institutions across the United States.

### Summary of Output Column Data:

The output data combines the information from the two input columns into a single, cohesive format. Each output entry consists of the name of the university or college followed by its geographical location, including the city, state, and, where initially omitted, the country ("USA") is consistently added to standardize the format. This process of combining and standardizing the data results in a uniform presentation of the educational institutions' names and locations, making it easier to understand the specific details of each institution's geographical setting. The addition of "USA" to entries missing the country in the input highlights an effort to ensure clarity and completeness in the geographical information provided.

### Relationship Between Input and Output:

The transformation from input to output data demonstrates a process of standardization and clarification. By merging the separate pieces of information (institution name and location) into a single, standardized format and ensuring the inclusion of the country where it was initially omitted, the output offers a more complete and easily understood representation of each educational institution's identity and location. This process underscores the importance of consistency in data presentation, particularly when dealing with qualitative data that includes names and geographical locations. The output effectively addresses any inconsistencies or omissions in the input data, resulting in a coherent and comprehensive dataset that accurately represents each institution within a unified format., and input as ['University of Pennsylvania', 'Phialdelphia, PA, USA'] output is University of Pennsylvania, Phialdelphia, PA, USA, input as ['UCLA', 'Los Angeles, CA'] output is UCLA, Los Angeles, CA, USA, input as ['Cornell University', 'Ithaca, New York, USA'] output is Cornell University, Ithaca, New York, USA, input as ['Penn', 'Philadelphia, PA, USA'] output is Penn, Philadelphia, PA, USA, input as ['University of Maryland College Park', 'College Park, MD'] output is University of Maryland College Park, College Park, MD, USA, input as ['University of Michigan', 'Ann Arbor, MI, USA'] output is University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.

def generated_function(name, location):
    """
    This function takes the name of an educational institution and its geographical location as inputs,
    combines them into a single string, and ensures the location includes the country 'USA' if it was initially omitted.
    
    Parameters:
    - name (str): The name of the university or college.
    - location (str): The geographical location of the institution, including city and state. The country may or may not be included.
    
    Returns:
    - str: A single string combining the institution's name and its standardized geographical location.
