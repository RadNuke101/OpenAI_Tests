Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Input Column Summary:

The input data consists of two columns, each representing different but related pieces of information about various educational institutions in the United States. The first column contains the names of the institutions, which vary from universities with their full names such as "University of Pennsylvania" to abbreviations like "UCLA" (University of California, Los Angeles). The second column provides the geographical location of these institutions, including the city and state. In some cases, the country "USA" is also included, while in others, it is omitted. This variation in detail suggests a lack of uniformity in how location data is presented.

### Output Column Summary:

The output data combines the information from the two input columns into a single, cohesive string for each institution. It presents the name of the institution followed by its geographical location, including the city, state, and, where initially omitted, the country "USA" is consistently added to standardize the format. This process of combining and standardizing the data results in a uniform presentation of each institution's name and location, making it easier to understand and compare the information at a glance.

### Relationship Between Input and Output:

The transformation from the input to the output columns demonstrates a process of data standardization and consolidation. The primary relationship between the input and output is the methodical integration of the institution's name with its geographical details into a single, standardized format. This not only ensures consistency across the dataset but also enhances readability and usability of the information. The addition of "USA" to locations that initially lacked the country designation serves to normalize the data, ensuring that each entry provides a complete picture of the institution's geographical context. This process reflects a common practice in data processing where disparate pieces of information are combined and standardized to facilitate easier analysis and comprehension., and input as ['University of Pennsylvania', 'Phialdelphia, PA, USA'] output is University of Pennsylvania, Phialdelphia, PA, USA, input as ['UCLA', 'Los Angeles, CA'] output is UCLA, Los Angeles, CA, USA, input as ['Cornell University', 'Ithaca, New York, USA'] output is Cornell University, Ithaca, New York, USA, input as ['Penn', 'Philadelphia, PA, USA'] output is Penn, Philadelphia, PA, USA, input as ['University of Maryland College Park', 'College Park, MD'] output is University of Maryland College Park, College Park, MD, USA, input as ['University of Michigan', 'Ann Arbor, MI, USA'] output is University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.

def generated_function(institution_name, location):
    """
    This function takes the name of an educational institution and its geographical location as inputs,
    and returns a single string combining both pieces of information. If the country 'USA' is not included
    in the location, it is added to standardize the format.
    
    Parameters:
    institution_name (str): The name of the educational institution.
