Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Summary of Input Column Data:

The input data consists of strings that describe various operating systems along with their versions and, in some cases, specific build numbers or configurations. These strings include a mix of operating system names (e.g., AIX, VMware ESX Server, Linux, Red Hat Enterprise, Microsoft Windows) and version information. The version information is sometimes directly stated and at other times embedded within additional context or specifications (e.g., build numbers, specific editions like Advanced Server, or configurations like largesmp). The operating systems represented span a range of types, including Unix-like systems (AIX, Linux), enterprise server solutions (VMware ESX Server, Red Hat Enterprise), and consumer-oriented systems (Microsoft Windows versions). The diversity in the input data reflects the wide variety of ways in which operating system versions are referenced and highlights the challenge of extracting concise version information from varied textual descriptions.

### Summary of Output Column Data:

The output data consists of simplified version numbers extracted from the more complex and varied input strings. These version numbers are presented in a decimal format, typically including a major version and a minor version (e.g., 5.1, 3.5, 2.6, 1.0, 6.1). The extraction process appears to focus on identifying and isolating the most relevant numerical information that represents the version of the operating system mentioned in the input, disregarding additional details such as build numbers, configurations, or specific editions. The output data provides a standardized way of representing version information, making it easier to understand and compare across different operating systems.

### Relationship Between Input and Output:

The relationship between the input and output data involves the process of parsing and extracting key version information from a variety of textual descriptions of operating systems. This process requires identifying the relevant numerical patterns that signify version numbers within the broader context of each input string. The challenge lies in the diversity of formats and the presence of additional, sometimes extraneous, information alongside the core version numbers. The output represents a distilled version of the input, focusing solely on the essential version numbers and presenting them in a consistent format. This transformation facilitates easier comparison and analysis of operating system versions by reducing the complexity and variability found in the original descriptions. The relationship underscores the importance of data processing techniques in extracting meaningful information from unstructured or semi-structured textual data., and input as ['AIX 5.1'] output is 5.1, input as ['VMware ESX Server 3.5.0 build-110268'] output is 3.5, input as ['Linux Linux 2.6 Linux'] output is 2.6, input as ['Red Hat Enterprise AS 4 <2.6-78.0.13.ELlargesmp>'] output is 2.6, input as ['Microsoft <R> Windows <R> 2000 Advanced Server 1.0'] output is 1.0, input as ['Microsoft Windows XP Win2008R2 6.1.7601'] output is 6.1, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
