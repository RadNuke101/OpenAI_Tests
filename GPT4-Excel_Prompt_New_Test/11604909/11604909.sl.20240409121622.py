Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Summary for Input Column Data:

The input data represents a variety of operating system (OS) versions from different vendors, including but not limited to AIX, VMware, Linux, Red Hat Enterprise, Microsoft Windows, and others. Each entry in the input data is a string that contains the name of the OS along with its version number and, in some cases, additional details such as build numbers, specific updates, or configurations (e.g., "build-110268", "<2.6-78.0.13.ELlargesmp>"). The format of these entries varies significantly across different OS vendors and versions, indicating a lack of a standardized format for representing OS version information. The input data encapsulates a mix of both server and desktop operating systems, highlighting a broad spectrum of computing environments.

### Summary for Output Column Data:

The output data extracts and simplifies the version number from the corresponding input data, focusing primarily on the major and minor version numbers (e.g., "5.1", "3.5", "2.6", "1.0", "6.1"). This simplification process removes additional details such as build numbers, specific updates, configurations, or any redundant naming conventions present in the input data. The output data represents a streamlined version of the OS version information, making it easier to understand and compare across different OS vendors and versions.

### Relationship Summary Between Input and Output:

The relationship between the input and output data is characterized by a process of extraction and simplification of OS version information from a more complex and detailed string. The transformation process involves:

1. **Identifying the Version Number:** Extracting the major and minor version numbers from the input string, which may contain a mix of letters, numbers, symbols, and additional descriptors.
2. **Simplification:** Removing extraneous details that are not directly related to the version number itself, such as build numbers, specific updates, configurations, or redundant naming conventions.
3. **Standardization:** Presenting the version information in a consistent format across different OS vendors and versions, focusing on the major and minor version numbers.

This relationship highlights the importance of parsing and standardizing complex data to extract relevant information, in this case, the version number of various operating systems. The process facilitates easier comparison and analysis of OS versions by distilling the essential version information from a diverse and complex set of input data., and input as ['AIX 5.1'] output is 5.1, input as ['VMware ESX Server 3.5.0 build-110268'] output is 3.5, input as ['Linux Linux 2.6 Linux'] output is 2.6, input as ['Red Hat Enterprise AS 4 <2.6-78.0.13.ELlargesmp>'] output is 2.6, input as ['Microsoft <R> Windows <R> 2000 Advanced Server 1.0'] output is 1.0, input as ['Microsoft Windows XP Win2008R2 6.1.7601'] output is 6.1, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
