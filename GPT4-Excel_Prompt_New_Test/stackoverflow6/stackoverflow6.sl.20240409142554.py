Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Summary for Input Column Data:

The input data appears to follow a structured format, which includes a timestamp, a phone number, and a message content, all separated by specific delimiters. The timestamp is formatted with a date (in "Month Day, Year" format), followed by a time (in "Hour=Minute AM/PM" format). After the timestamp, a phone number is provided, prefixed with a country code (in this case, "+91" which is the country code for India). The phone number and the message content are separated by an "=" sign. The entire structure suggests that these inputs might be extracted from a messaging system or application, where each entry logs the time a message was sent, the sender's phone number, and the content of the message itself.

### Summary for Output Column Data:

The output data consists of the message content extracted from the input data. It is the text that follows the "=" sign after the phone number in the input data. This content varies in length and composition but is essentially the payload or the body of the message being communicated. The output data is stripped of any contextual information such as the time it was sent or the sender's identity, focusing solely on the message content.

### Relationship Between Input and Output:

The relationship between the input and output data is straightforward: the output is a subset of the input, specifically the message content portion. The process of deriving the output from the input involves parsing the input string to isolate and extract the message content, discarding the timestamp and the sender's phone number. This extraction suggests a filtering or parsing operation where the goal is to focus on the textual content of messages for further analysis or processing, possibly for tasks like content analysis, sentiment analysis, or other forms of textual data mining. The structured nature of the input data facilitates this extraction process, allowing for a consistent method to obtain the message content across different entries., and input as ['Dec 2, 2014, 11=23 PM - +91 90000 80000= loren ipsum'] output is loren ipsum, input as ['Dec 2, 2014, 11=24 PM - +91 90000 80000= loren'] output is loren, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
