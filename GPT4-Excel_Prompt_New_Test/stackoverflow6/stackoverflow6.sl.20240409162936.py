Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Input Column Summary:

The input column data consists of strings that follow a specific format, which includes a timestamp, a phone number, and a message. Each entry is structured as follows:

1. **Timestamp**: The timestamp is given in a specific format, starting with the date (e.g., "Dec 2, 2014"), followed by the time (e.g., "11=23 PM"). The date and time are separated by a comma. The time portion uses a 12-hour clock format and is followed by either "AM" or "PM".

2. **Phone Number**: After the timestamp, there is a phone number prefixed with a country code (e.g., "+91 90000 80000"). The country code and the phone number are separated by a space.

3. **Message**: Following the phone number, there is an equals sign ("="), which precedes the actual message content (e.g., "loren ipsum").

The entire entry is encapsulated within square brackets and quotes, indicating that each entry is a string element within a list. The format is consistent across entries, with variations only in the specific details of the timestamp, phone number, and message content.

### Output Column Summary:

The output column data consists of strings that represent the message content extracted from the input column. Each entry in the output column corresponds directly to the message part of the input column, stripped of the timestamp and phone number information. The output retains the original formatting and case of the message as it appeared in the input.

### Relationship Summary:

The relationship between the input and output columns is a straightforward extraction process, where the output is a specific subset of the information presented in the input. Specifically, the output is the message content that follows the equals sign ("=") in the input data, with all preceding information (timestamp and phone number) removed. This process isolates the message content from the structured format of the input, providing a clear and concise representation of the message itself, devoid of any contextual metadata like the time it was sent or the sender's phone number. The extraction process is consistent across all entries, indicating a systematic approach to parsing the input data to retrieve the desired information., and input as ['Dec 2, 2014, 11=23 PM - +91 90000 80000= loren ipsum'] output is loren ipsum, input as ['Dec 2, 2014, 11=24 PM - +91 90000 80000= loren'] output is loren, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
