Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Summary for Input Column Data:

The input data consists of strings that follow a specific format, which includes a timestamp, a phone number, and a message. The format is structured as follows: a date in "MMM DD, YYYY" format, followed by a time with an AM/PM indicator, a dash, a phone number prefixed with a country code, an equals sign, and finally, the message content. The date and time provide a timestamp for when the message was sent or received. The phone number indicates the sender or recipient of the message. The equals sign acts as a delimiter separating the metadata (date, time, phone number) from the actual message content.

### Summary for Output Column Data:

The output data consists of strings that are extracted from the input data, specifically the message content that follows the equals sign in each input string. This content varies in length and composition but is essentially the payload or the main body of the message being communicated. The output data is devoid of any metadata, focusing solely on the textual content of the messages.

### Relationship Between Input and Output:

The relationship between the input and output data is a process of extraction and focus shift. The input data contains a mix of metadata (timestamp and phone number) and the actual message content, serving as a comprehensive record of communication. The output data, on the other hand, isolates and presents only the message content, stripping away all metadata. This process highlights the content of the messages as the primary focus of interest, disregarding the contextual details about when the message was sent and who sent it. The transformation from input to output signifies a filtering operation where the essence or core information (the message content) is distilled from the surrounding contextual information., and input as ['Dec 2, 2014, 11=23 PM - +91 90000 80000= loren ipsum'] output is loren ipsum, input as ['Dec 2, 2014, 11=24 PM - +91 90000 80000= loren'] output is loren, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
