Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Given the data and the task, we can summarize the relationship between the input and the output as follows:

### Input Column Summary:
The input data consists of strings formatted as three groups of three digits each, separated by hyphens (e.g., 'XXX-XXX-XXX'). Each group of digits ranges from 000 to 999, and there doesn't seem to be an immediately apparent pattern or sequence to these numbers at a glance. The input data is qualitative, treating each string as a unique identifier or code rather than a numerical value to be calculated or analyzed quantitatively.

### Output Column Summary:
The output data consists of the last group of three digits from the input string. These outputs are also treated as qualitative data, meaning each output is seen as a distinct category or identifier rather than a numerical value. The range of outputs is similar to the range of each group in the input, from 000 to 999, but in this dataset, it specifically represents the last segment of the input data.

### Relationship Summary:
The relationship between the input and output data is straightforward: the output is directly extracted from the input, specifically being the last group of three digits in the input string. There is a one-to-one correspondence between each input and its output, with the output serving as a subset of the input data. This relationship suggests that the output could be used as a key or identifier that is part of a larger code or sequence represented by the input. The process of deriving the output from the input does not involve any transformation or calculation beyond extraction of the last segment. This relationship is consistent across all provided examples, indicating a rule-based extraction rather than a conditional or computational relationship., and input as ['938-242-504'] output is 504, input as ['308-916-545'] output is 545, input as ['623-599-749'] output is 749, input as ['981-424-843'] output is 843, input as ['118-980-214'] output is 214, input as ['244-655-094'] output is 094, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
