Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Given the examples provided, we can observe a clear pattern in the relationship between the input and output data. The input data consists of strings formatted as three groups of three digits each, separated by hyphens (e.g., 'XXX-XXX-XXX'). The output data is always the last group of three digits from the input string.

### Input Column Summary:
- The input data is formatted as strings with a consistent pattern: three groups of three digits each, separated by hyphens.
- Each group of digits ranges from 000 to 999, but no specific range or pattern within these groups is indicated by the examples provided.
- The input data appears to be qualitative in nature, with the specific numbers not directly influencing the output beyond their position in the string.

### Output Column Summary:
- The output data consists of the last group of three digits from the input string.
- These outputs are also formatted as strings and range from 000 to 999.
- The output is directly determined by the structure of the input data, specifically the last segment of the input string.

### Relationship Summary:
- The relationship between the input and output data is straightforward and based on the position of the digits within the input string. The output is always the last set of three digits from the input, regardless of the specific numbers present.
- This relationship indicates that the process to obtain the output from the input is a simple extraction of the last segment of the input string.
- There is no transformation or calculation involved in deriving the output from the input; it is purely a matter of extracting the relevant portion of the input data.

In summary, the relationship between the input and output data is defined by the format and structure of the input strings, with the output being a direct extraction of the last part of these strings., and input as ['938-242-504'] output is 504, input as ['308-916-545'] output is 545, input as ['623-599-749'] output is 749, input as ['981-424-843'] output is 843, input as ['118-980-214'] output is 214, input as ['244-655-094'] output is 094, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
