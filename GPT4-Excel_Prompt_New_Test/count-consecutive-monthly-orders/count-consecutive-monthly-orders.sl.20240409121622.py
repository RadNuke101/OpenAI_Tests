Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: To generate a summary for each input column and the output column, we'll first look at the provided data in a structured manner. Let's break down the input and output data:

### Input Columns:
- **Column 1:** [7, 0, 5, 0, 3, 5]
- **Column 2:** [0, 0, 6, 4, 0, 3]
- **Column 3:** [0, 2, 4, 5, 3, 2]
- **Column 4:** [5, 3, 6, 0, 0, 5]
- **Column 5:** [4, 3, 0, 0, 1, 6]
- **Column 6:** [4, 0, 7, 2, 2, 1]

### Output Column:
- **Output:** [3, 3, 4, 2, 2, 6]

### Summary for Input Columns:
1. **Column 1:** Values range from 0 to 7, with a mix of mid to high values, and a single 0 indicating a possible low-end outlier or a special case.
2. **Column 2:** Values range from 0 to 6, with zeros indicating potential low-end outliers or special cases, and the rest spread across mid to high values.
3. **Column 3:** Values are more evenly distributed from 2 to 4, with a single high value of 6, indicating a more consistent range but with potential for outliers.
4. **Column 4:** Values range from 0 to 6, with a mix of zeros indicating potential low-end outliers or special cases, and the rest are mid to high values.
5. **Column 5:** Values range from 0 to 6, with zeros and a single low value (1), indicating potential outliers or special cases, and the rest are mid to high values.
6. **Column 6:** Values are more evenly spread from 0 to 7, indicating a wide range of values with potential outliers or special cases at the low end.

### Summary for Output Column:
- **Output:** Values range from 2 to 6, indicating a mid to high range with no apparent low-end outliers. The distribution suggests a relationship with the input columns that might not be linear or directly proportional, given the variation in input values corresponding to similar output values.

### Relationship Summary:
- The relationship between the input columns and the output seems to be non-linear, as there isn't a clear pattern where increasing or decreasing values in any single input column consistently leads to higher or lower output values.
- The presence of zeros in the input columns suggests that they might represent special conditions or states that significantly influence the output, but not in a straightforward additive or subtractive manner.
- The variation in output values for similar ranges of input values across different columns suggests that the output might be determined by a combination of factors from multiple columns rather than a direct correlation with values from any single column.
- The data hints at a complex relationship where certain combinations of values across the input columns lead to specific output values, possibly indicating a rule-based system or a model that considers multiple inputs simultaneously to determine the output.

In summary, the relationship between the input columns and the output column appears to be governed by a complex set of rules or conditions, rather than a simple linear or directly proportional relationship. Understanding the exact nature of this relationship would likely require further analysis, possibly including a more detailed examination of the specific combinations of input values that lead to each output value., and input as ['7 0 0 5 4 4'] output is 3, input as ['0 0 2 3 3 0'] output is 3, input as ['5 6 4 6 0 7'] output is 4, input as ['0 4 5 0 0 2'] output is 2, input as ['3 0 3 0 1 2'] output is 2, input as ['5 3 2 5 6 1'] output is 6, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
