Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Input Column Summary:

The input data consists of strings representing phone numbers in a specific format. Each phone number is structured with dashes separating the area code, the central office code, and the line number, following the North American Numbering Plan (NANP) format: NXX-NXX-XXXX. Here, 'N' represents digits from 2 to 9, while 'X' represents any digit from 0 to 9. The input data is qualitative, as it represents categorical information in the form of phone numbers, despite being composed of digits. Each entry in the input column is unique and follows a consistent pattern, indicating a standardized method of recording phone numbers.

### Output Column Summary:

The output data consists of strings representing phone numbers with the dashes removed, resulting in a continuous string of digits. The transformation from the input to the output involves the removal of the formatting characters (dashes) without altering the order or value of the digits themselves. The output retains the qualitative nature of the input data, as it still represents phone numbers, but in a simplified format that might be used for systems requiring numerical-only input or for ease of processing in certain computational tasks.

### Relationship Summary:

The relationship between the input and output columns is a direct, deterministic transformation process focused on the removal of formatting characters (dashes) from the input phone numbers. This process does not alter the intrinsic value or the order of the digits within each phone number. The transformation can be viewed as a data cleaning or preprocessing step, where the goal is to standardize the phone numbers into a format that is perhaps more suitable for storage, analysis, or further processing in a database or a software application. The relationship highlights a common task in data preparation, where qualitative data is modified to meet the requirements of specific use cases or to ensure consistency across a dataset., and input as ['801-345-1987'] output is 8013451987, input as ['612-554-2000'] output is 6125542000, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
