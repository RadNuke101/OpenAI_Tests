Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Summary for Input Column Data

The input data consists of two columns, with each row representing a specific university and its corresponding location. The first column includes the full name or abbreviation of universities located in the United States, such as "University of Pennsylvania," "UCLA," "Cornell University," and others. This column showcases a mix of well-known public and private institutions, highlighting their diverse nomenclature that includes both full names and commonly used abbreviations.

The second column provides the geographical location of each university mentioned in the first column. These locations are specified with varying degrees of detail, including city and state, with some entries also including the country ("USA"). Notably, there are inconsistencies in the representation of state names (e.g., "PA" vs. "Pennsylvania") and city names (e.g., "Phialdelphia" which is a misspelling of "Philadelphia"). Additionally, the inclusion of "USA" is not consistent across all entries.

### Summary for Output Column Data

The output data standardizes the format of the geographical locations provided in the second input column. It corrects inconsistencies and errors found in the input, such as standardizing state abbreviations (e.g., converting "New York" to "NY") and correcting misspellings (e.g., "Phialdelphia" to "Philadelphia"). Furthermore, it ensures uniformity by appending ", USA" to all entries, assuming all universities are located within the United States. This process creates a consistent format for representing the locations of the universities, making it easier to understand and compare.

### Relationship Between Input and Output

The transformation from input to output data demonstrates a process of standardization and error correction for the geographical locations associated with various universities in the United States. The primary goal of this process is to achieve a uniform representation of university locations, which involves:

1. Correcting spelling errors in city names.
2. Standardizing state abbreviations to ensure consistency.
3. Ensuring the country ("USA") is explicitly mentioned in all entries, providing clarity especially for an international audience.

This relationship underscores the importance of data cleaning and standardization, especially when dealing with qualitative data that may have been entered manually or sourced from multiple origins. By applying these corrections and standardizations, the output data becomes more accessible and useful for comparison, analysis, or integration into broader datasets., and input as ['University of Pennsylvania', 'Phialdelphia, PA, USA'] output is Phialdelphia, PA, USA, input as ['UCLA', 'Los Angeles, CA'] output is Los Angeles, CA, USA, input as ['Cornell University', 'Ithaca, New York, USA'] output is Ithaca, NY, USA, input as ['Penn', 'Philadelphia, PA, USA'] output is Philadelphia, PA, USA, input as ['University of Maryland College Park', 'College Park, MD'] output is College Park, MD, USA, input as ['University of Michigan', 'Ann Arbor, MI, USA'] output is Ann Arbor, MI, USA, input as ['Columbia University', 'New York, NY, USA'] output is New York, NY, USA, input as ['NYU', 'New York, New York, USA'] output is New York, NY, USA, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
