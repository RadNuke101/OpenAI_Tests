Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Input Column Summary:

The input data consists of strings that follow a specific format: a prefix (e.g., "R/V", "R/S", "R/B") followed by a set of three numerical values enclosed in angle brackets "<>". The prefix appears to denote a category or type, with the part before the slash being constant ("R") across all inputs, and the part after the slash varying (e.g., "V", "S", "B"). The numerical values within the angle brackets are separated by commas and represent a set of three distinct numbers. These numbers could potentially represent a range of values, such as RGB color codes or other numerical data relevant to the prefix category.

### Output Column Summary:

The output data retains the structure of the input data but with a simplified format. The transformation involves removing the angle brackets "<>", replacing them with spaces, and removing the commas between the numerical values. The prefix remains unchanged, but the format is more streamlined and easier to read. The output preserves the original information from the input but in a format that is potentially more accessible for further processing or analysis.

### Relationship Between Input and Output:

The transformation from input to output involves a formatting change that simplifies the representation of the data without altering the inherent information it conveys. The process can be summarized as follows:

1. **Preservation of Prefix**: The category/type indicator (e.g., "R/V", "R/S", "R/B") is preserved exactly, indicating that the categorization or type distinction is crucial both in the original and transformed data.

2. **Removal of Enclosures**: The angle brackets enclosing the numerical values are removed in the output, suggesting that the specific enclosure format is not essential for the interpretation or use of the data.

3. **Separation Change**: The commas separating the numerical values in the input are replaced with spaces in the output, which could indicate a preference for a space-separated format in subsequent data processing or analysis steps.

4. **Data Integrity**: The numerical values are preserved exactly from input to output, emphasizing that while the format may change, the integrity and accuracy of the data are paramount.

In summary, the transformation from input to output is primarily a matter of formatting, designed to maintain the essential information while making the data more accessible or suitable for further processing steps. The relationship between the input and output underscores the importance of both the categorical/type information and the numerical values, with the transformation focused on enhancing readability and usability., and input as ['R/V<208,0,32>'] output is R/V 208 0 32, input as ['R/S<184,28,16>'] output is R/S 184 28 16, input as ['R/B<255,88,80>'] output is R/B 255 88 80, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
