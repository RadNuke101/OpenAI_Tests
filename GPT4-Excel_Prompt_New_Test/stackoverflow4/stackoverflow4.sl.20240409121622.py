Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Input Column Summary:

The input data consists of strings that follow a specific format: a prefix (e.g., "R/V", "R/S", "R/B") followed by a set of three numerical values enclosed in angle brackets "<>". The prefix appears to denote a category or type, while the numerical values likely represent some form of parameters or attributes associated with that category. Each of these components is separated by specific characters, such as "/", "<", ",", and ">". The prefixes before the "/" seem to be consistent ("R"), indicating a common category or domain, while the letters following the "/" vary (e.g., "V", "S", "B"), suggesting subcategories or specific types within the broader category.

### Output Column Summary:

The output data retains the structure of the input data but simplifies it by removing the angle brackets and the commas, resulting in a cleaner format that still preserves the essential information. The output format is a sequence of the prefix (e.g., "R/V", "R/S", "R/B") followed by the three numerical values, now separated by spaces. This transformation makes the data more straightforward and possibly easier to read or process for further applications.

### Relationship Between Input and Output:

The transformation from input to output involves a simplification process that removes certain characters ("<", ">", ",") and replaces them with spaces, while retaining the core structure of the data. This process suggests a standardization or normalization step that could be part of preparing the data for further analysis or use in other systems. The relationship indicates that the essential information (the prefix and the numerical values) is preserved during the transformation, while the format is made more uniform and possibly more compatible with systems or formats that require simpler delimiters (such as spaces instead of angle brackets and commas).

In summary, the transformation from input to output serves to standardize the data format while preserving the key information, indicating a preparation step for further processing or analysis., and input as ['R/V<208,0,32>'] output is R/V 208 0 32, input as ['R/S<184,28,16>'] output is R/S 184 28 16, input as ['R/B<255,88,80>'] output is R/B 255 88 80, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
