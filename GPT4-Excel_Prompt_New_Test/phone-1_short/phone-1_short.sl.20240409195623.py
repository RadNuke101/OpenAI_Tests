Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Summary of Input Column Data

The input data consists of strings formatted as three groups of three digits each, separated by hyphens (e.g., 'XXX-XXX-XXX'). Each group of digits ranges from 000 to 999, without any apparent restriction on repetition or sequence. The format is consistent across all inputs, suggesting a structured form of data, possibly representing codes, identifiers, or categorized numerical information. The diversity in the middle group of numbers, as seen in the examples, does not follow a clear pattern or sequence, indicating that the selection of these numbers is not based on a simple arithmetic rule or progression.

### Summary of Output Column Data

The output data consists of three-digit numbers (e.g., 'XXX'), extracted from the input data. These numbers specifically correspond to the middle group of digits in the input strings. The outputs range from 242 to 980 in the provided examples, showing a wide distribution of values without immediate repetition. This suggests that the output is directly related to the specific segment of the input data, rather than being the result of a calculation or transformation applied to the input numbers.

### Relationship Between Input and Output

The relationship between the input and output data is straightforward: the output is directly extracted from the input, specifically being the middle group of three digits in the input string. There is no transformation or manipulation of the numbers from input to output; the output is a subset of the input data. This relationship indicates that the task is one of data extraction, focusing on isolating a particular segment of interest within a larger structured string. The purpose behind selecting the middle group for output could be driven by the significance of this segment in the context of the data's application, such as highlighting a specific category, identifier, or key piece of information that is centrally located within the input strings., and input as ['938-242-504'] output is 242, input as ['308-916-545'] output is 916, input as ['623-599-749'] output is 599, input as ['981-424-843'] output is 424, input as ['118-980-214'] output is 980, input as ['244-655-094'] output is 655, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
