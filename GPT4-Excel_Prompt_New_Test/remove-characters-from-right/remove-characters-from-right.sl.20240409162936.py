Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Input Column Summary:

The input data consists of strings that represent distances in miles. Each entry in the column is formatted as a numerical value followed by the word "miles". The numerical part of these strings varies, indicating different distances. The format is consistent across all entries, suggesting a standardized way of representing distances. The data is qualitative in nature, as it is represented in a textual format, even though it describes quantitative distances. The presence of the word "miles" in each entry makes it clear that the distances are measured in the same unit, providing a uniform scale for measurement across the dataset.

### Output Column Summary:

The output data is purely numerical and represents the distances extracted from the input data, devoid of the unit of measurement ("miles"). Each output is a direct numerical representation of the distance mentioned in the corresponding input entry. The transformation from input to output involves extracting the numerical part of the input data and presenting it as an integer. This process converts the qualitative representation of distances in the input data into a quantitative format in the output data, making it suitable for numerical analysis and operations.

### Relationship Summary:

The relationship between the input and output data is a process of extraction and conversion from a qualitative to a quantitative representation of distances. The input data provides distances in a textual format, combining numerical values with the unit of measurement ("miles"). The output data, on the other hand, isolates the numerical values from the input, removing the textual context (the unit of measurement) and presenting the distances in a purely numerical form. This transformation facilitates the use of the distance data in numerical calculations and analyses, which would not be as straightforward with the qualitative input format. The consistent format of the input data ensures a reliable and uniform process for generating the output data across the dataset., and input as ['736 miles'] output is 736, input as ['1255 miles'] output is 1255, input as ['1221 miles'] output is 1221, input as ['790 miles'] output is 790, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
