Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Input Column Summary:

The input data consists of strings that appear to follow a structured format, which includes a prefix ('geb.'), a date (composed of a day, month, and year), and in some cases, a location name followed by an abbreviation (e.g., 'Westerkerk HRL'). The prefix 'geb.' suggests a specific context or category for the data, possibly indicating an event such as a birth, given its resemblance to the German or Dutch word for 'born'. The dates provided in the inputs span from at least 1956 to 1987, indicating the data points refer to events or records from these years. The inclusion of a location name in some inputs but not others suggests variability in the completeness of the records or the relevance of the location to the event being recorded.

### Output Column Summary:

The output data extracts and presents only the location names and their associated abbreviations from the input data, when available. In cases where the input does not include a location name, the output is empty. This indicates that the primary focus of the output is to isolate and present location-related information from the broader context provided in the input.

### Relationship Summary:

The relationship between the input and output data is characterized by a filtering or extraction process, where the output is derived by isolating specific pieces of information (location names and abbreviations) from the input. The presence of a structured format in the input allows for this targeted extraction, suggesting that the process is designed to identify and remove the location-related details from a more complex string of information. The consistent prefix ('geb.') and the structured date format in the input do not appear in the output, indicating that these elements are not relevant for the extraction process's purpose. The variability in the completeness of the input data (i.e., some inputs include location names while others do not) directly impacts the output, leading to cases where the output is either populated with the extracted location information or left empty when such information is not provided in the input. This relationship underscores a focused interest in the geographical aspect of the records, possibly for purposes such as mapping, analysis of geographical distribution, or simply separating location data from other event details., and input as ['geb. 14 oct 1956 Westerkerk HRL'] output is Westerkerk HRL, input as ['geb. 14 oct 1956 '] output is , input as ['geb. 15 feb 1987 Westerkerk HRL'] output is Westerkerk HRL, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
