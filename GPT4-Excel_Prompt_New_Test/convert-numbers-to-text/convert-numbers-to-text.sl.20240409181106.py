Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Input Column Summary:

The input column consists of a series of strings that represent numbers. Each entry in the column is a string that contains only numeric characters (0-9) and does not include any leading zeroes, except for the number zero itself, which would presumably be represented as '0'. The strings vary in length, indicating that the numbers they represent can range from single-digit to potentially very large numbers. The input data is qualitative in nature because it is treated as strings of text, even though the content of these strings is numeric.

### Output Column Summary:

The output column contains integers that are the direct numerical representation of the strings in the input column. Each string from the input column is converted into an integer, maintaining the exact value that the string represents. The output is quantitative data, as it directly represents numerical values. The range of these values can vary significantly, from small numbers to very large ones, depending on the length and content of the input strings.

### Relationship Summary:

The relationship between the input and output columns is a direct transformation from a qualitative representation of numbers to a quantitative representation. Each string in the input column, which qualitatively represents a number through a sequence of characters, is converted into an actual numerical value in the output column. This process involves parsing the string as an integer, effectively transitioning the data from a textual (qualitative) form to a numerical (quantitative) form without altering the value it represents.

This transformation allows for the numerical manipulation and analysis of the values that were originally presented as strings, enabling operations and comparisons that require quantitative data. The integrity of the numerical value is preserved through this conversion, ensuring that the output accurately reflects the value indicated by the input string. This relationship highlights the versatility of data representation and the importance of context in data processing, where qualitative data can be transformed into quantitative data to suit analytical needs., and input as ['101'] output is 101, input as ['1002'] output is 1002, input as ['743'] output is 743, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
