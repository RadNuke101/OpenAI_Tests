Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Input Column Summary:

The input data consists of two distinct columns, each containing specific information about various universities and colleges in the United States. The first column lists the names of the institutions, which include a mix of full university names (e.g., "University of Pennsylvania"), abbreviations (e.g., "UCLA", "MIT"), and informal names (e.g., "Penn"). The second column provides the geographical location of each institution, formatted as the city and state, with some entries also including the country ("USA"). The locations vary widely across the United States, covering both coasts, the Midwest, and southern states, reflecting a broad representation of American higher education institutions. The data captures a variety of institution types, from large public universities (e.g., "University of Michigan") to prestigious private colleges (e.g., "Harvard University"), and includes both urban (e.g., "NYU" in New York, NY) and more rural settings (e.g., "Cornell University" in Ithaca, New York).

### Output Column Summary:

The output data consolidates the information from the two input columns into a single string for each entry, formatted as "Institution Name, Location". This format maintains the original naming conventions and geographical details provided in the input, seamlessly integrating the institution's name with its location without altering the content. The output strings are concise yet comprehensive, offering a clear and immediate understanding of each institution's identity and its geographical context. This unified format is beneficial for quick reference, making it easier to identify the institution and its location in a straightforward manner.

### Relationship Summary:

The relationship between the input and output data is a process of concatenation and formatting. The transformation takes the discrete pieces of information provided in the two input columns—namely, the name of the institution and its geographical location—and combines them into a single, cohesive output string. This process does not alter the original information but rather restructures it into a more compact and accessible format. The output effectively bridges the gap between identifying an institution and understanding its geographical context, serving a dual purpose of preserving the integrity of the original data while enhancing its usability and readability. This transformation demonstrates a straightforward yet impactful method of data summarization and presentation, suitable for various applications where quick identification and location of an institution are required., and input as ['University of Pennsylvania', 'Phialdelphia, PA, USA'] output is University of Pennsylvania, Phialdelphia, PA, USA, input as ['UCLA', 'Los Angeles, CA'] output is UCLA, Los Angeles, CA, input as ['Cornell University', 'Ithaca, New York, USA'] output is Cornell University, Ithaca, New York, USA, input as ['Penn', 'Philadelphia, PA, USA'] output is Penn, Philadelphia, PA, USA, input as ['University of Maryland College Park', 'College Park, MD'] output is University of Maryland College Park, College Park, MD, input as ['University of Michigan', 'Ann Arbor, MI, USA'] output is University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA, input as ['UC Berkeley', 'Berkeley, CA'] output is UC Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, input as ['MIT', 'Cambridge, MA'] output is MIT, Cambridge, MA, input as ['Rice University', 'Houston, TX'] output is Rice University, Houston, TX, input as ['Yale University', 'New Haven, CT, USA'] output is Yale University, New Haven, CT, USA, input as ['Columbia University', 'New York, NY, USA'] output is Columbia University, New York, NY, USA, input as ['NYU', 'New York, New York, USA'] output is NYU, New York, New York, USA, input as ['UC Berkeley', 'Berkeley, CA'] output is UC Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, input as ['UIUC', 'Urbana, IL'] output is UIUC, Urbana, IL, input as ['Temple University', 'Philadelphia, PA'] output is Temple University, Philadelphia, PA, input as ['Harvard University', 'Cambridge, MA, USA'] output is Harvard University, Cambridge, MA, USA, input as ['University of Connecticut', 'Storrs, CT, USA'] output is University of Connecticut, Storrs, CT, USA, input as ['Drexel University', 'Philadelphia, PA'] output is Drexel University, Philadelphia, PA, input as ['New Haven University', 'New Haven, CT, USA'] output is New Haven University, New Haven, CT, USA, input as ['University of California, Santa Barbara', 'Santa Barbara, CA, USA'] output is University of California, Santa Barbara, Santa Barbara, CA, USA, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
