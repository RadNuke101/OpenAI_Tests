Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Input Column Summary:

The input data consists of two distinct columns, each containing qualitative information about higher education institutions in the United States. The first column lists the names of universities or colleges, which vary from well-known public and private institutions to more specialized or less widely recognized schools. These names include both formal names (e.g., "University of Pennsylvania") and informal or abbreviated names (e.g., "Penn," "UCLA"). The second column provides the geographical location of each institution, including the city and state, with some entries also including the country ("USA") for clarity. This column shows a variety of locations across the U.S., indicating a broad geographical distribution of these institutions. The data captures a snapshot of the diversity and range of higher education options available in the country, highlighting both the institutions' names and their specific locations.

### Output Column Summary:

The output data consolidates the information from the two input columns into a single string for each institution, combining the name of the university or college with its geographical location. This amalgamation is done by appending the location directly after the institution's name, separated by a comma. The output maintains the original formatting and naming conventions provided in the input data, including the use of informal or abbreviated names and the inclusion of "USA" in some of the locations. The resulting strings provide a concise yet comprehensive identification for each institution, encapsulating both its identity and its geographical context. This format is useful for quickly conveying where each institution is based, alongside its name, in a format that is easy to read and understand.

### Relationship Summary:

The relationship between the input and output columns is a transformation process that merges the separate pieces of qualitative data (institution name and location) from the input columns into a single, cohesive string in the output column. This process does not alter the original data but restructures it to provide a more integrated representation of each institution's identity and location. The output effectively serves as a summary or label for each entry, combining essential identifying information in a format that is both informative and efficient for communication or cataloging purposes. This transformation highlights the importance of both the name and location in identifying and differentiating institutions within the diverse landscape of higher education in the United States., and input as ['University of Pennsylvania', 'Phialdelphia, PA, USA'] output is University of Pennsylvania, Phialdelphia, PA, USA, input as ['UCLA', 'Los Angeles, CA'] output is UCLA, Los Angeles, CA, input as ['Cornell University', 'Ithaca, New York, USA'] output is Cornell University, Ithaca, New York, USA, input as ['Penn', 'Philadelphia, PA, USA'] output is Penn, Philadelphia, PA, USA, input as ['University of Maryland College Park', 'College Park, MD'] output is University of Maryland College Park, College Park, MD, input as ['University of Michigan', 'Ann Arbor, MI, USA'] output is University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA, input as ['UC Berkeley', 'Berkeley, CA'] output is UC Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, input as ['MIT', 'Cambridge, MA'] output is MIT, Cambridge, MA, input as ['Rice University', 'Houston, TX'] output is Rice University, Houston, TX, input as ['Yale University', 'New Haven, CT, USA'] output is Yale University, New Haven, CT, USA, input as ['Columbia University', 'New York, NY, USA'] output is Columbia University, New York, NY, USA, input as ['NYU', 'New York, New York, USA'] output is NYU, New York, New York, USA, input as ['UC Berkeley', 'Berkeley, CA'] output is UC Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, input as ['UIUC', 'Urbana, IL'] output is UIUC, Urbana, IL, input as ['Temple University', 'Philadelphia, PA'] output is Temple University, Philadelphia, PA, input as ['Harvard University', 'Cambridge, MA, USA'] output is Harvard University, Cambridge, MA, USA, input as ['University of Connecticut', 'Storrs, CT, USA'] output is University of Connecticut, Storrs, CT, USA, input as ['Drexel University', 'Philadelphia, PA'] output is Drexel University, Philadelphia, PA, input as ['New Haven University', 'New Haven, CT, USA'] output is New Haven University, New Haven, CT, USA, input as ['University of California, Santa Barbara', 'Santa Barbara, CA, USA'] output is University of California, Santa Barbara, Santa Barbara, CA, USA, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
