Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Summary of Input Column Data

The input data consists of strings that describe various vehicle maintenance or monitoring components, each followed by a unique alphanumeric identifier. These strings are structured in a way that they start with a description of a vehicle-related component or system, such as 'Tire Pressure', 'Oil Life', or 'Air conditioner', followed by the unique identifier which seems to be a mix of letters and numbers. The descriptions provide context about what aspect of the vehicle the identifier is related to, indicating a diverse range of vehicle maintenance or monitoring systems. The identifiers are embedded within these descriptions and are not immediately distinguishable without analyzing the context of the string.

### Summary of Output Column Data

The output data extracts and isolates the unique alphanumeric identifiers from the input strings. These identifiers, such as 'ABC123873', 'ABC849999999021', and 'GHF211', are crucial for distinguishing between different vehicle maintenance or monitoring components. The output data strips away the descriptive context provided in the input, focusing solely on these identifiers. This suggests that the identifiers themselves hold significant value, possibly for tracking, referencing, or categorizing purposes related to vehicle maintenance or monitoring activities.

### Relationship Between Input and Output

The relationship between the input and output data is characterized by a process of extraction and focus. The input data provides a contextual backdrop, describing various vehicle-related components or systems, each associated with a unique identifier. The process involves identifying and extracting these unique identifiers from the broader descriptive context. The output data, therefore, represents a distilled version of the input, where the emphasis shifts from the descriptive narrative about vehicle components to the specific, unique identifiers associated with each component.

This transformation from input to output highlights the importance of the identifiers in managing or referencing specific vehicle maintenance or monitoring components. It suggests a system where the identifiers serve as key references or tags, enabling efficient tracking, categorization, or retrieval of information related to vehicle maintenance. The extraction process underscores the utility of these identifiers beyond their immediate context, possibly for use in databases, inventory management, or service tracking systems where concise and precise references are essential., and input as ['Tire Pressure ABC123873 Monitor'] output is ABC123873, input as [' Oil Life ABC849999999021 gauge'] output is ABC849999999021, input as [' Air conditioner GHF211 maintenance'] output is GHF211, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
