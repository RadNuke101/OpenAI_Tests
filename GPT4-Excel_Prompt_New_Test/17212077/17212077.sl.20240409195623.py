Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Summary of Input Column Data:

The input data consists of dates formatted as strings in the "MM/DD/YYYY" format, where:
- "MM" represents the two-digit month,
- "DD" represents the two-digit day, and
- "YYYY" represents the four-digit year.

Each entry in the input column represents a specific date, including the month, day, and year components. The data is qualitative in nature, as it describes a specific attribute (date) in a structured text format. The input data does not directly quantify or measure anything but instead specifies points in time.

### Summary of Output Column Data:

The output data transforms the input dates into a simplified format, represented as strings in the "MM/YYYY" format, where:
- "MM" represents the two-digit month, and
- "YYYY" represents the four-digit year.

This transformation removes the day component ("DD") from the input dates, focusing only on the month and year. The output data retains the qualitative nature of the input by describing specific periods (months in specific years) without quantifying anything. The format change indicates a shift in granularity from specific days to broader months.

### Relationship Between Input and Output:

The transformation from the input to the output column data involves a simplification process where the day component of the dates is omitted, leaving only the month and year. This process indicates a change in the level of detail from specific days to more general months, reducing the granularity of the temporal information provided.

The relationship between the input and output can be summarized as follows:
- **Consistency in Components**: Both input and output retain the month and year components, ensuring that the temporal context is preserved.
- **Reduction in Granularity**: By removing the day component, the output abstracts the date information to a higher level, focusing on the month and year only.
- **Qualitative Nature Maintained**: Despite the transformation, the data remains qualitative, describing periods without quantifying them.

This transformation could be useful in contexts where the specific days are not as relevant as the months and years, allowing for a broader overview of time periods without the need for day-level precision., and input as ['01/15/2013'] output is 01/2013, input as ['03/07/2011'] output is 03/2011, input as ['05/09/2009'] output is 05/2009, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
