Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Summary of Input Column Data:

The input data consists of strings representing dates in the format "MM/DD/YYYY", where:
- "MM" stands for the two-digit month,
- "DD" stands for the two-digit day, and
- "YYYY" stands for the four-digit year.

Each entry in the input column is a unique date, indicating a specific day, month, and year. The data is qualitative in nature, representing specific points in time rather than numerical values that can be manipulated mathematically. The input data is consistent in its format, allowing for straightforward interpretation and processing.

### Summary of Output Column Data:

The output data retains a part of the input data's structure but simplifies it into a "MM/YYYY" format, where:
- "MM" represents the two-digit month, and
- "YYYY" represents the four-digit year.

This transformation indicates a shift from a specific day representation to a more general month and year representation. The output data omits the day ("DD") component present in the input data, focusing instead on the month and year as the primary identifiers. Like the input, the output data is qualitative, emphasizing the timing aspect without delving into numerical analysis.

### Relationship Between Input and Output:

The transformation from the input to the output data involves a simplification process where the specific day component of the date is removed, leaving only the month and year. This process suggests a shift in focus from a precise date to a broader time frame, indicating that the specific day is not relevant for the intended analysis or categorization. The relationship between the input and output data highlights a filtering or reduction operation, where only the essential components (month and year) for a given context are retained.

This transformation can be useful in scenarios where the specific day is not critical to the analysis, and a more general time frame (month and year) is sufficient. It simplifies the data while retaining the key temporal information, making it easier to categorize, compare, or analyze trends over time without the granularity of specific days., and input as ['01/15/2013'] output is 01/2013, input as ['03/07/2011'] output is 03/2011, input as ['05/09/2009'] output is 05/2009, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
