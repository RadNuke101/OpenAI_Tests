Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Summary of Input Column Data:

The input data consists of a series of dates formatted as strings in the "MM/DD/YYYY" format. Each entry in the column represents a specific date, including the month (MM), day (DD), and year (YYYY). The data is qualitative in nature, as it represents categorical information about specific points in time rather than numerical measurements. The input data appears to be diverse in terms of the years and months represented, suggesting a range of dates spanning different months and years. There is no indication that the data follows a specific chronological order or pattern within the column.

### Summary of Output Column Data:

The output data transforms the input dates into a simplified format, represented as strings in the "MM/YYYY" format. This transformation involves retaining the month and year from the input data while omitting the day. As with the input, the output data is qualitative, categorizing dates by month and year without specifying the exact day. The output format emphasizes the period (month and year) rather than the specific day, which could be useful for analyses or summaries that require a broader time frame rather than precise dates.

### Relationship Between Input and Output:

The transformation from the input to the output column data involves a process of simplification and generalization of the dates. Specifically, the relationship can be summarized as follows:

1. **Retention of Month and Year:** Both the month and year components of the dates are preserved during the transformation, indicating that these elements are considered significant for the output data's intended use or analysis.

2. **Omission of Day:** The day component is removed in the output data, suggesting that the specific day of the month is not necessary for the purposes of the output data. This could be due to the output data's focus on broader time periods or because the specific day is irrelevant to the analysis or application for which the data is intended.

3. **Format Consistency:** Both input and output maintain a consistent formatting style, using slashes ("/") to separate the components of the dates. This consistency aids in readability and understanding of the data transformation process.

4. **Qualitative Nature:** The transformation process does not alter the qualitative nature of the data. Both before and after transformation, the data represents categorical information about time periods, rather than numerical values or measurements.

In summary, the relationship between the input and output data columns involves a simplification process that retains the month and year for each date while omitting the day. This transformation suggests a focus on broader time periods and maintains the qualitative, categorical nature of the data., and input as ['01/15/2013'] output is 01/2013, input as ['03/07/2011'] output is 03/2011, input as ['05/09/2009'] output is 05/2009, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
