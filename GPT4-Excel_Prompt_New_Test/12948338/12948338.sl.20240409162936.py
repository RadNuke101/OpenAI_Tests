Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Input Column Summary:

The input data consists of two primary components per row. The first component is a string that contains a sentence or a sequence of sentences. These sentences include one or more instances of usernames or words, which are sometimes prefixed with an underscore (_). The context of these sentences suggests a social media or conversational setting, where mentions of users (denoted by the underscore prefix) are common. The second component is a single word or username (without the underscore prefix) that appears to be the target for identification within the first component of the input.

The strings in the first component vary in length and complexity, containing multiple occurrences of the target word or username, either with or without the underscore prefix. The context and usage of these words or usernames suggest a dynamic narrative or conversation, possibly reflecting interactions typical of social media platforms.

The target words or usernames in the second component are key to understanding the relationship between the input and the output. They are the focal point around which the analysis or operation is performed, serving as the criterion for counting or identification within the first component of the input.

### Output Column Summary:

The output data is a series of integers. Each integer corresponds to a row of input data and represents the count of occurrences of the target word or username (specified in the second component of the input) within the first component of the input. This count includes only those instances where the target word or username is prefixed with an underscore, indicating a specific form of mention or usage within the given string.

### Relationship Summary:

The relationship between the input and the output data is a function of identification and quantification. The process involves scanning the first component of the input for occurrences of the target word or username (as specified in the second component of the input) that are prefixed with an underscore. The output is the result of this scanning process, quantifying the number of times the target word or username, with the underscore prefix, appears within the string.

This relationship highlights a specific pattern recognition task, where the focus is on identifying and counting specific forms of words or usernames (underscore-prefixed) within a larger text. The underscore prefix plays a crucial role in this task, serving as a marker for the words or usernames of interest. The output's numerical value directly reflects the frequency of these marked occurrences, providing a quantified measure of the presence of the target word or username within the context of the input string., and input as ['An example string with _username in it RT _AwesomeUser says _username is awesome', 'username'] output is 2, input as ['An example string with _username in it RT _AwesomeUser says _username is awesome', 'AwesomeUser'] output is 1, input as ['An _example string with _example in it is awesome _example', 'example'] output is 3, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
