'''
Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: return everything after the last ".' in the inputted expression, and input as ['www.domain.com'] output is com, input as ['mail.net'] output is net, input as ['www.amaon.co.uk'] output is uk, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.

def generated_function(expression):
    # Split the expression by '.' and return the last element
    return expression.split('.')[-1]

# Test cases
output1 = generated_function('www.domain.com')
output2 = generated_function('mail.net')
output3 = generated_function('www.amaon.co.uk')

# The outputs can be used as needed, for example, printing them
print(output1)  # Expected: com
print(output2)  # Expected: net
print(output3)  # Expected: uk
print(generated_function("www.domain.com"))  ## Output: com
print(generated_function("mail.net"))  ## Output: net
print(generated_function("www.amaon.co.uk"))  ## Output: uk
