Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Input Column Summary:

The input column consists of a series of internet domain names. These domain names are strings that represent addresses where different entities host their websites. The format of these domain names varies but typically includes a combination of "www," a specific name (which could be the name of a company, organization, or service), and a domain suffix which indicates the top-level domain (TLD) under which the domain is registered. The TLD can be generic (.com, .net) or country-specific (.co.uk for the United Kingdom). The input data does not follow a strict pattern in terms of the presence of "www" or the specificity of the domain (e.g., "domain.com" vs. "amaon.co.uk"), but each entry is a valid representation of how domain names are structured on the internet.

### Output Column Summary:

The output column extracts and presents the top-level domain (TLD) from each domain name provided in the input column. The TLD is the last part of the domain name and is used to specify the domain's category or the country code it is associated with. In the given examples, the output includes generic TLDs such as "com" and "net," as well as a country-specific TLD "uk." This column simplifies the domain names to their most categorical or geographical identifier, stripping away other elements of the web address to focus solely on the TLD.

### Relationship Summary:

The relationship between the input and output columns is a process of extraction and simplification, where the complex and varied domain names provided as input are distilled down to their essential, defining component: the top-level domain (TLD). This process involves identifying and isolating the last segment of each domain name after the final dot, which signifies the TLD. The output, therefore, represents a categorization or geographical identification of the domain names based on their TLDs. This relationship highlights the significance of the TLD in classifying and locating internet domains within the vast digital landscape of the web. The transformation from a full domain name to just its TLD underscores the importance of TLDs in understanding the nature (generic vs. specific) and origin (global vs. country-specific) of web domains., and input as ['www.domain.com'] output is com, input as ['mail.net'] output is net, input as ['www.amaon.co.uk'] output is uk, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
