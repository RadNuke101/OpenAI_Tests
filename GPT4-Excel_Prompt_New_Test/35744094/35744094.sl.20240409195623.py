Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Input Column Summary:

The input data consists of URLs, each representing a web page from a company's website. These URLs are structured to include the protocol (either HTTP or HTTPS), followed by the domain name, and often include additional path segments that point to specific sections or products within the website. The domains observed in the examples are `www.apple.com` and `www.microsoft.com`, indicating that the companies involved are Apple and Microsoft, respectively. The path segments vary, pointing to different products or services offered by these companies, such as `/uk/mac` for Apple's Mac section of their UK website, and `/en-gb/windows` for Microsoft's Windows section of their UK website. The structure of these URLs follows a common pattern: protocol, domain, country code (optional), and product or service.

### Output Column Summary:

The output data extracts specific product or company names from the given URLs. These outputs are single words like "mac," "windows," or "microsoft," which represent either a product category or the company itself. The output provides a simplified identifier or key term associated with the content or primary focus of the URL. This simplification allows for a quick understanding or categorization of the URL's content without needing to parse the entire URL.

### Relationship Summary:

The relationship between the input and output data is a process of extracting and simplifying key information from a structured URL to identify the primary focus or category of the webpage. This process involves parsing the URL to isolate specific segments that indicate the product, service, or company being referenced. The output is essentially a distilled version of the input, highlighting the most relevant or defining aspect of the URL in a single word. This relationship demonstrates a method of data reduction and categorization, where complex or lengthy URLs are simplified to their most essential components, making it easier to understand or analyze the content or focus of the web page at a glance. This can be particularly useful for tasks involving categorization, indexing, or summarizing web content based on the company or product being referenced., and input as ['http=//www.apple.com/uk/mac'] output is mac, input as ['https=//www.microsoft.com/en-gb/windows'] output is windows, input as ['https=//www.microsoft.com/'] output is microsoft, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
