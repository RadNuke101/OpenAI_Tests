Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Summary for Input Column Data

The input data consists of two columns, with each row representing a specific university or college and its corresponding location. The first column includes the names of the universities or colleges, which vary from full names like "University of Pennsylvania" to abbreviations such as "UCLA" (University of California, Los Angeles). This column shows a diversity in how institutions of higher education can be referred to, encompassing both formal names and commonly used nicknames or acronyms.

The second column provides the geographical locations of these institutions. These locations are presented with varying degrees of detail. Some entries include the city, state, and country, while others might omit the country or use abbreviations for the state. This column highlights the geographical spread of these institutions across the United States, from the East Coast (e.g., New York, Philadelphia) to the West Coast (e.g., Los Angeles), and includes both large cities and smaller towns.

### Summary for Output Column Data

The output data standardizes the format of the geographical locations associated with each university or college mentioned in the input data. The output ensures consistency in presenting the city, state abbreviation, and country ("USA") for each location. It corrects any misspellings (e.g., "Phialdelphia" to "Philadelphia") and standardizes state names to their two-letter abbreviations (e.g., "New York" to "NY"). The inclusion of "USA" in every output entry, even when omitted in the input, emphasizes the country-wide context of these institutions. This standardization process facilitates a clearer and more uniform understanding of where each institution is located, making it easier to compare or reference them based on geographical location.

### Relationship Between Input and Output

The relationship between the input and output data illustrates a process of standardization and correction of geographical information associated with various universities and colleges in the United States. The transformation from input to output seeks to achieve uniformity in how locations are presented, ensuring clarity and consistency across entries. This process involves correcting misspellings, standardizing state abbreviations, and adding missing information (such as the country "USA") when necessary. The output serves as a refined and more accessible version of the input locations, tailored for ease of understanding and comparison across different educational institutions., and input as ['University of Pennsylvania', 'Phialdelphia, PA, USA'] output is Phialdelphia, PA, USA, input as ['UCLA', 'Los Angeles, CA'] output is Los Angeles, CA, USA, input as ['Cornell University', 'Ithaca, New York, USA'] output is Ithaca, NY, USA, input as ['Penn', 'Philadelphia, PA, USA'] output is Philadelphia, PA, USA, input as ['University of Maryland College Park', 'College Park, MD'] output is College Park, MD, USA, input as ['University of Michigan', 'Ann Arbor, MI, USA'] output is Ann Arbor, MI, USA, input as ['Columbia University', 'New York, NY, USA'] output is New York, NY, USA, input as ['NYU', 'New York, New York, USA'] output is New York, NY, USA, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
