Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Summary of Input Column Data:

The input data consists of two columns, each representing different aspects of information related to various universities in the United States. The first column specifies the name of the university, which includes a mix of full university names (e.g., "University of Pennsylvania") and abbreviations or informal names (e.g., "UCLA" for University of California, Los Angeles). This variety indicates a broad representation of institutions, covering both private and public universities, and includes those with both national and international recognition.

The second column provides the location of each university, but the format is not consistent across entries. Some locations are given with full detail, including the city, state abbreviation, and country (e.g., "Philadelphia, PA, USA"), while others omit the country (e.g., "Los Angeles, CA") or use a full state name instead of an abbreviation (e.g., "Ithaca, New York, USA"). This inconsistency suggests a need for standardization in representing university locations.

### Summary of Output Column Data:

The output data standardizes the location information provided in the second column of the input data. It consistently formats the location as "City, State Abbreviation, USA," ensuring uniformity across all entries. This standardization process involves correcting spelling errors (e.g., "Phialdelphia" to "Philadelphia"), abbreviating state names (e.g., "New York" to "NY"), and adding the country ("USA") where it was previously omitted. The output demonstrates a clear effort to provide a concise and uniform representation of university locations across the United States, making the data more accessible and easier to understand at a glance.

### Relationship Between Input and Output:

The transformation from input to output data illustrates a process of standardization and error correction for university locations in the United States. The input data's inconsistency in naming conventions and location details is refined into a consistent format in the output, enhancing clarity and usability. This process underscores the importance of uniform data presentation, especially when dealing with qualitative information that may originally come in varied formats. The relationship between the input and output highlights the value of data processing in making information more standardized and accessible, which is crucial for analysis, comparison, and communication purposes., and input as ['University of Pennsylvania', 'Phialdelphia, PA, USA'] output is Phialdelphia, PA, USA, input as ['UCLA', 'Los Angeles, CA'] output is Los Angeles, CA, USA, input as ['Cornell University', 'Ithaca, New York, USA'] output is Ithaca, NY, USA, input as ['Penn', 'Philadelphia, PA, USA'] output is Philadelphia, PA, USA, input as ['University of Maryland College Park', 'College Park, MD'] output is College Park, MD, USA, input as ['University of Michigan', 'Ann Arbor, MI, USA'] output is Ann Arbor, MI, USA, input as ['Columbia University', 'New York, NY, USA'] output is New York, NY, USA, input as ['NYU', 'New York, New York, USA'] output is New York, NY, USA, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
