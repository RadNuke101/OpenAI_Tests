Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Input Column Summary:

The input data consists of two distinct parts:

1. **Phrases Describing Objects or Scenes**: The first part of each input set is a phrase or a series of phrases that describe objects, colors, or scenes. These phrases are combinations of colors and objects (e.g., "red ball, green sweater") or just a simple description involving colors (e.g., "red green blue"). They provide a context in which colors are associated with certain objects or are simply listed together.

2. **List of Colors**: Following the descriptive phrase(s), there is a list of colors. These colors are not tied to any specific object or scene in the description but are listed as standalone items (e.g., "red", "green", "pink"). This list seems to serve as a set of criteria or a reference for evaluating the descriptive phrases.

### Output Column Summary:

The output is a binary value (true or false) that appears to be determined by the relationship between the descriptive phrases and the list of colors provided in the input. The exact nature of this relationship dictates whether the output is true or false.

### Relationship Between Input and Output:

The relationship between the input and the output seems to be based on whether the colors mentioned in the descriptive phrases (part 1 of the input) match or are contained within the list of colors provided (part 2 of the input). Specifically, the output is true if:

1. **All Colors Match**: All the colors mentioned in the descriptive phrases are found within the list of colors provided. This indicates a direct match between the colors described and the colors listed.

2. **Partial Matches with Specific Conditions**: In some cases, even if not all colors from the descriptive phrases are listed, the output can still be true. This suggests that there might be specific conditions under which partial matches are considered acceptable.

However, the output is false if:

1. **Mismatch or Missing Colors**: If any color mentioned in the descriptive phrases is not found in the list of colors, and if the specific conditions for a partial match are not met, the output is false. This indicates a mismatch or an incomplete match between the described colors and the listed colors.

In summary, the output seems to be a reflection of the degree of match between the colors described in the phrases and the colors listed. The true or false outcome is determined by whether the described colors fully match, partially match under certain conditions, or do not match the list of colors provided., and input as ['red ball, green sweater', 'red', 'green', 'pink'] output is true, input as ['pink ball, green sweater', 'red', 'green', 'pink'] output is false, input as ['blue sea, pink ribbon', 'red', 'blue', 'pink'] output is false, input as ['black sea, white ribbon', 'red', 'blue', 'pink'] output is false, input as ['red green blue', 'red', 'blue', 'pink'] output is true, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
