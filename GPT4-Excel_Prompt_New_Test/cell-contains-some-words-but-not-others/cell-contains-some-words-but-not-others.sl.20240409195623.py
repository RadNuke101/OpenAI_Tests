Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Summary of Input Column Data:

The input data consists of two parts: a list of items and a set of three color keywords. The first part of each input is a descriptive phrase or list that mentions various items along with their colors, such as "red ball, green sweater" or "blue sea, pink ribbon". These phrases describe scenarios or objects with associated colors. The second part of the input is a consistent set of three color keywords across all inputs, which are 'red', 'green', and 'pink' in most cases, with 'blue' replacing one of the colors in some inputs. The color keywords seem to serve as a filter or criteria set against the descriptive phrases.

### Summary of Output Column Data:

The output data is binary, consisting of either true or false values. The output appears to be determined by whether the descriptive phrase in the first part of the input contains all the color keywords listed in the second part of the input. If all the color keywords are present in the descriptive phrase, the output is true. If any of the color keywords are missing from the descriptive phrase, the output is false.

### Relationship Between Input and Output:

The relationship between the input and output data hinges on the presence of the color keywords within the descriptive phrases. The output is true when the descriptive phrase includes all the color keywords specified in the second part of the input. This suggests a rule-based system where the output is determined by checking for the inclusion of specific color keywords within the descriptive phrases. The process can be summarized as a matching operation, where the task is to verify whether all elements from a set of criteria (color keywords) are present within a given context (descriptive phrase). If the criteria are fully met, the result is positive (true); if not, the result is negative (false). This setup indicates a straightforward logical relationship where the output is contingent upon the complete match of the specified criteria within the input data., and input as ['red ball, green sweater', 'red', 'green', 'pink'] output is true, input as ['pink ball, green sweater', 'red', 'green', 'pink'] output is false, input as ['blue sea, pink ribbon', 'red', 'blue', 'pink'] output is false, input as ['black sea, white ribbon', 'red', 'blue', 'pink'] output is false, input as ['red green blue', 'red', 'blue', 'pink'] output is true, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
