Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Summary of Input Column Data

The input data consists of a collection of sentences followed by a series of keywords. Each sentence describes a scene or an object, incorporating various colors and elements. The keywords that follow are specific words that seem to be of interest in the context of the sentence. These keywords are consistent across different inputs and include colors like 'yellow' and 'green', as well as objects or beings, such as 'dog'. The sentences vary in their content, describing diverse scenarios from dogs on grass to neon signs, but they all share the commonality of mentioning colors and potentially a dog. The variability in the sentences suggests a broad range of contexts in which the keywords can appear, indicating the importance of these keywords in determining the relationship between the input sentences and the output.

### Summary of Output Column Data

The output data is binary, consisting of true or false values. These values seem to be determined based on whether the input sentences and the following keywords meet a certain criterion. The true or false outcome appears to be directly related to the presence of all the keywords within the sentence. When the sentence contains all the keywords listed after it, the output is true. Conversely, when at least one of the keywords is missing from the sentence, the output is false. This binary nature of the output suggests a straightforward, rule-based relationship between the input data and the output.

### Summary of the Relationship Between Input and Output

The relationship between the input sentences and the output values is governed by the presence of the specified keywords within each sentence. If a sentence contains all the keywords listed after it, the output is true, indicating that the sentence meets the criteria set by the keywords. If any of the keywords are missing from the sentence, the output is false, showing that the sentence does not fully align with the specified keywords. This relationship highlights the importance of the keywords in determining the relevance or compliance of the sentences with a given criterion, which in this case, is the inclusion of certain colors and possibly an object or being (e.g., a dog). The binary output serves as an indicator of whether the sentences contain the elements of interest defined by the keywords, providing a clear, rule-based connection between the input data and the output., and input as ['yellow dog on green grass', 'yellow', 'green', 'dog'] output is true, input as ['Lone dog with a green frisbie on yellow sand', 'yellow', 'green', 'dog'] output is true, input as ['A yellow sun in a green field', 'yellow', 'green', 'dog'] output is false, input as ['yellow neon sign with a green background', 'yellow', 'green', 'dog'] output is false, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
