Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Input Column Summary:

The input data consists of two distinct parts: a set of sentences and a list of keywords. Each sentence describes a scene or an object, incorporating various colors and elements. The keywords are specific words that are expected to be found within the sentences. These keywords typically include colors and objects, such as "yellow," "green," and "dog." The sentences vary in context, ranging from animals on colored backgrounds to objects and natural elements described with color attributes. The diversity in sentence construction and context provides a rich dataset for analyzing the presence of specific keywords within textual information.

### Output Column Summary:

The output data is binary, indicating a true or false value. These values represent whether all the keywords listed in the input are found within the corresponding sentence. A true value indicates that every keyword listed has been identified within the sentence, suggesting a direct match for each keyword within the textual context provided. Conversely, a false value indicates that at least one of the keywords is missing from the sentence, highlighting an incomplete match between the sentence and the list of keywords.

### Relationship Summary:

The relationship between the input and output data hinges on the presence of specific keywords within the sentences. When a sentence contains all the keywords listed, the output is true, signifying a complete match. This relationship underscores the importance of keyword detection within textual data, serving as a basic form of content analysis. The true or false output acts as a simple indicator of whether the textual content meets the criteria set by the list of keywords, essentially functioning as a filter based on keyword inclusion. This mechanism can be particularly useful in applications requiring content categorization, search functionality, or basic content analysis where the presence of specific terms or elements is a critical factor., and input as ['yellow dog on green grass', 'yellow', 'green', 'dog'] output is true, input as ['Lone dog with a green frisbie on yellow sand', 'yellow', 'green', 'dog'] output is true, input as ['A yellow sun in a green field', 'yellow', 'green', 'dog'] output is false, input as ['yellow neon sign with a green background', 'yellow', 'green', 'dog'] output is false, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
