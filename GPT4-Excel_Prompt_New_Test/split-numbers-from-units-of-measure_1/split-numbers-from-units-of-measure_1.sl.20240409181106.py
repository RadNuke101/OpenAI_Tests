Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Summary for Input Column Data:

The input column data consists of strings that are a combination of numerical values followed by alphabetical characters. These strings appear to represent measurements or quantities, with the numerical part indicating the magnitude and the alphabetical part likely denoting the unit or type of measurement (e.g., 'v' for volts, 'hrs' for hours, 'h' for hours, 'm' for meters). The second part of the input is a single digit, which does not seem to directly correlate with the numerical value in the first part of the input. The variety in the types of units ('v', 'hrs', 'h', 'm') suggests that the data could be from multiple domains or contexts, such as electrical measurements, time durations, and distances.

### Summary for Output Column Data:

The output column data consists solely of numerical values. These values directly correspond to the numerical part of the first element in the input data, stripped of any alphabetical characters. This indicates that the process or function applied to the input data extracts the numerical component from the first part of the input, disregarding the unit or type of measurement indicated by the alphabetical characters. The output values retain the magnitude of the measurement but lose the context provided by the units.

### Relationship Summary:

The relationship between the input and output data is a transformation process that extracts and isolates the numerical magnitude from a mixed-format string (numerical followed by alphabetical characters). This process ignores the second part of the input (the single digit) and any unit or type information provided by the alphabetical characters in the first part of the input. The output is purely the numerical value, indicating that the transformation focuses on quantifying the input data without retaining any qualitative or contextual information about the type or unit of measurement. This suggests that the purpose of the transformation is to standardize or simplify the input data into a uniform numerical format, possibly for further quantitative analysis or processing where the specific units of measurement are not required or are handled separately., and input as ['80v', '3'] output is 80, input as ['10hrs', '3'] output is 10, input as ['7h', '2'] output is 7, input as ['500m', '4'] output is 500, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
