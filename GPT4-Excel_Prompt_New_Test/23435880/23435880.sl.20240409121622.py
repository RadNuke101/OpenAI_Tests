Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Input Column Summary:

The input data consists of two distinct parts for each entry: a sentence or phrase containing one or more instances of a particular word, and the target word itself. The sentences or phrases are constructed in a way that they include the target word in various forms, such as singular, plural, or within different contexts. The target word is specified separately to clearly indicate which word's occurrence is to be counted within the given text. This setup suggests that the input data is designed to test the ability to identify and count specific words or terms within a text, taking into account their various forms and the context in which they appear.

### Output Column Summary:

The output data provides a single integer value for each input entry, representing the count of the specified target word within the given text. This count reflects not just the literal occurrence of the word as it is spelled in the target word input but also includes its various forms as they appear in the context of the sentence or phrase. The output is a direct quantitative measure of the presence of the target word within the input text, indicating the frequency of the specified word.

### Relationship Between Input and Output:

The relationship between the input and output data is a direct function of word occurrence counting within a given text. The input provides a context (a sentence or phrase) and specifies a target word to be counted. The output then reflects the number of times that target word, in any of its applicable forms, appears within the provided text. This relationship underscores a task of text analysis focused on word frequency analysis, requiring an understanding of not just the literal appearance of words but also their morphological variations and contextual relevance. The process involves identifying the target word within the text, counting its occurrences, and understanding that words can appear in different forms while still being counted as occurrences of the same target word. This task highlights the complexity of natural language processing, especially in recognizing and accounting for the nuances of language use, such as pluralization and contextual usage., and input as ['apple apples', 'apple'] output is 2, input as ['an orange among the oranges is a spoiled orange', 'orange'] output is 3, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
