Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Summary of Input Column Data:

The input data consists of two columns, with each row representing a specific university or college and its associated location. The first column contains the names of various higher education institutions, including a mix of full university names (e.g., "University of Pennsylvania", "Cornell University", "University of Maryland College Park", "University of Michigan") and abbreviations or informal names (e.g., "UCLA", "Penn"). These institutions are located across different states in the USA, reflecting a geographical diversity within the country's higher education landscape.

The second column provides the geographical locations of these institutions, typically including the city and state. In some cases, the country ("USA") is also explicitly mentioned, while in others, it is omitted, presumably because the context of the data set is understood to be within the United States. The locations vary from major metropolitan areas (e.g., "Los Angeles, CA", "Philadelphia, PA") to smaller cities or towns that are perhaps known primarily for hosting these institutions (e.g., "Ithaca, New York", "Ann Arbor, MI", "College Park, MD").

### Summary of Output Column Data:

The output data is a simplified or standardized version of the second input column, focusing solely on the geographical locations associated with each institution. It appears to follow a consistent format where the city, state, and, when initially omitted, the country ("USA") are included. This standardization process adds "USA" to entries where it was previously missing, ensuring a uniform presentation of the geographical data across all entries. The output data retains the essential location information (city, state, and country) necessary for identifying the whereabouts of each institution within the United States.

### Relationship Between Input and Output:

The relationship between the input and output columns demonstrates a process of standardization and clarification of geographical information associated with various higher education institutions in the USA. The input data provides a starting point with two pieces of information: the name of an institution and its location, which may or may not include the country. The output data then focuses on refining the location information to a consistent format that always includes the city, state, and country ("USA"), regardless of whether the country was mentioned in the original input.

This transformation process highlights the importance of having a uniform presentation of geographical data, making it easier to understand and compare the locations of different institutions. It also implicitly corrects any minor errors in the original input (e.g., "Phialdelphia" to "Philadelphia") and adds missing information (e.g., "USA") to ensure that each entry is complete and accurate. The relationship between the input and output underscores the value of data standardization, especially in contexts where geographical clarity and consistency are crucial., and input as ['University of Pennsylvania', 'Phialdelphia, PA, USA'] output is Phialdelphia, PA, USA, input as ['UCLA', 'Los Angeles, CA'] output is Los Angeles, CA, USA, input as ['Cornell University', 'Ithaca, New York, USA'] output is Ithaca, New York, USA, input as ['Penn', 'Philadelphia, PA, USA'] output is Philadelphia, PA, USA, input as ['University of Maryland College Park', 'College Park, MD'] output is College Park, MD, USA, input as ['University of Michigan', 'Ann Arbor, MI, USA'] output is Ann Arbor, MI, USA, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.

def generated_function(institution, location):
    """
    This function standardizes the geographical location information associated with higher education institutions in the USA.
    It ensures the output format includes the city, state, and country ("USA"), even if the country was omitted in the input.
    
    Parameters:
    - institution: The name of the higher education institution (not used in the current implementation, but included for completeness).
    - location: The geographical location of the institution, which may or may not include the country.
    
    Returns:
    - A string representing the standardized geographical location in the format "City, State, USA".
