Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Input Column Summary:

The input data consists of single-word strings that appear to be combinations of smaller words or standalone words. These strings can be categorized into two main types: 

1. **Compound Words**: These are combinations of two smaller words where the first word is often "that," and the second word is a verb (e.g., "thatensures," "thatwill," "thathave") or another word forming a meaningful phrase. In one instance, "knowthat" combines "know" with "that," deviating slightly from the pattern of the first word being "that."

2. **Standalone Words**: These are words that do not follow the pattern of being a combination of two smaller words (e.g., "that," "mouse"). 

The input data suggests a pattern where the presence of "that" at the beginning of a compound word might indicate a specific processing rule or a form of segmentation based on the word structure.

### Output Column Summary:

The output data consists of single-word strings that are either verbs, nouns, or conjunctions. The relationship between the input and output data indicates a process of extraction or segmentation where:

1. **From Compound Words**: The process extracts or isolates the second part of the compound word when "that" is the first part (e.g., "thatensures" to "ensures"). In the case of "knowthat," the process isolates "know," indicating that the rule might prioritize extracting the first word if it doesn't start with "that."

2. **From Standalone Words**: The process seems to simply replicate the input word in the output without any modification (e.g., "that" to "that," "mouse" to "mouse").

### Relationship Summary:

The relationship between the input and output data suggests a rule-based extraction or segmentation process. This process appears to prioritize:

- Extracting the second part of compound words when the first part is "that."
- Extracting the first part of compound words when it does not start with "that" but is followed by "that."
- Leaving standalone words unchanged.

This indicates a structured approach to processing the input data, likely aimed at isolating specific components of compound words or maintaining standalone words as they are for further use or analysis., and input as ['thatensures'] output is ensures, input as ['thatwill'] output is will, input as ['thathave'] output is have, input as ['knowthat'] output is know, input as ['that'] output is that, input as ['mouse'] output is mouse, input as ['knowthat'] output is know, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
