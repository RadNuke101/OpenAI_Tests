Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Summary for Input Column Data

The input data consists of strings that represent numbers in a textual format, each separated by a delimiter "/n". The strings range from "one" to potentially higher numbers, expressed in a sequential manner. Each string within a single input can be considered a list of numbers, starting from "one" and increasing by one for each additional number, separated by the delimiter. The format suggests a structured approach to representing a sequence of numbers in a textual and ordered manner. The input data is qualitative, as it represents categories (in this case, numbers in word form) rather than numerical values that can be manipulated mathematically.

### Summary for Output Column Data

The output data is numerical and directly correlates to the count of numbers represented in the input data. It is quantitative, providing a clear, numeric representation of the amount of distinct numbers (or items) mentioned in each input string. The output is a single integer value for each input, summarizing the total count of numbers expressed in the input string.

### Relationship Summary Between Input and Output

The relationship between the input and output data is a direct mapping of the count of qualitative, textual representations of numbers to a quantitative numerical value. The output serves as a summary metric, quantifying how many distinct numbers are mentioned in each input string. This mapping is consistent and linear, with the output value increasing by one for each additional number represented in the input. The use of the delimiter "/n" in the input is crucial for determining the count, as it separates each textual number, allowing for an accurate tally to be reflected in the output. This relationship highlights a transformation from a qualitative representation of data (textual numbers) to a quantitative summary (numeric count), providing a succinct overview of the information contained within each input string., and input as ['one'] output is 1, input as ['one/ntwo'] output is 2, input as ['one/ntwo/nthree'] output is 3, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
