Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Input Column Summary:

The input data consists of a primary string followed by three keywords. The primary string is a descriptive sentence that may or may not contain the keywords following it. These keywords are 'yellow', 'green', and 'dog'. The sentences vary in context, describing scenes or objects with specific colors and sometimes animals. The keywords remain constant across the dataset, suggesting they are the focus for analysis or filtering within the given context.

### Output Column Summary:

The output data is binary, represented by true or false values. These values seem to be determined by the presence or absence of the keywords within the primary string of the input data. When the primary string contains all the keywords listed after it, the output is true. Conversely, if any of the keywords are missing from the primary string, the output is false.

### Relationship Summary:

The relationship between the input and output data hinges on the inclusion of specific keywords within the primary string of the input. The output is true if all the keywords ('yellow', 'green', and 'dog') are found within the primary sentence. This indicates a direct correlation between the presence of these keywords in the descriptive sentence and the boolean value in the output. The purpose of this setup appears to be to identify whether a given descriptive sentence contains all of a predetermined set of keywords. This could be used for filtering content, tagging, or categorization based on the presence of certain elements or themes described in text., and input as ['yellow dog on green grass', 'yellow', 'green', 'dog'] output is true, input as ['warm gray sweater', 'yellow', 'green', 'dog'] output is false, input as ['A yellow sun in a green field', 'yellow', 'green', 'dog'] output is true, input as ['yellow neon sign with a green background', 'yellow', 'green', 'dog'] output is true, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
