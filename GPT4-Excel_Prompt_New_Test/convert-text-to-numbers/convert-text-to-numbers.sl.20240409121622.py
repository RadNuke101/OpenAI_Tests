Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Input Column Summary:

The input data consists of a single column containing strings that represent numerical values. These strings vary in length and composition but are exclusively made up of digits (0-9), with no leading zeros. Each entry in the column is unique and treated as qualitative data, meaning the focus is on the categorical aspect of the data rather than its numerical value. The input data appears to be directly related to the output data in a specific manner, which will be discussed in the output summary.

### Output Column Summary:

The output data is directly derived from the input column. Each output is a numerical representation of the string provided in the input. The transformation process involves converting the string format of numbers into their actual numerical values. This conversion process maintains the integrity and value of the numbers represented by the strings. The output is treated as quantitative data, showcasing a clear, one-to-one relationship with the input data. Each output value is unique and corresponds directly to the unique string in the input column.

### Relationship Summary:

The relationship between the input and output data is straightforward and linear. The input data, while treated as qualitative due to its string format, represents numerical values. The process involves a simple conversion from the string representation of a number (input) to its numerical form (output). This conversion does not alter the value but changes the data type from string (qualitative) to a numerical format (quantitative).

This relationship indicates a direct mapping where each input string is uniquely converted to its numerical counterpart without any loss of information or alteration of the value. The process is deterministic, meaning for every unique input string, there is a precisely corresponding numerical output. This conversion process highlights the importance of understanding the nature of the data (qualitative vs. quantitative) and how it can be transformed to serve different analytical purposes while maintaining the inherent value and meaning of the data., and input as ['101'] output is 101, input as ['1002'] output is 1002, input as ['743'] output is 743, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
