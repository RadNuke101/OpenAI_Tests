Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Input Column Summary:

The input data consists of two columns. The first column contains a constant string value 'spreadsheet' for all entries. This string is composed of 11 characters, each unique in its position within the word. The second column is a series of integers in string format, ranging from '1' to '5'. These integers represent a positional index within the string provided in the first column.

### Output Column Summary:

The output data is a single column that corresponds to the character from the string 'spreadsheet' at the position specified by the integer in the second input column. The outputs are individual characters, each representing a sequential extraction from the string 'spreadsheet' based on the index value provided in the second input column. The sequence of outputs follows the order of characters in the string 'spreadsheet', starting from 's' at position 1, 'p' at position 2, and so on, illustrating a direct mapping from the index to the character at that position in the string.

### Relationship Summary:

The relationship between the input and output columns is a direct positional mapping. The first input column provides a constant string 'spreadsheet', which serves as the source for character extraction. The second input column specifies the position of the character to be extracted from the string in the first column, acting as an index. The output column then displays the character from the 'spreadsheet' string that corresponds to the index number provided in the second input column.

This relationship demonstrates a straightforward extraction process where the second input column's numerical value directly determines the output character by specifying its position in the constant string provided in the first input column. This process is consistent across all entries, indicating a deterministic and predictable relationship between the input indices and the output characters., and input as ['spreadsheet', '1'] output is s, input as ['spreadsheet', '2'] output is p, input as ['spreadsheet', '3'] output is r, input as ['spreadsheet', '4'] output is e, input as ['spreadsheet', '5'] output is a, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
