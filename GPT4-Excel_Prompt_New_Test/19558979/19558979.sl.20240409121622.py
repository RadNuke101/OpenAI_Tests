Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Input Column Summary:

The input data consists of two columns. The first column contains a single, repeated qualitative value, "spreadsheet," which is a string of characters. The second column is a series of integers in string format, incrementing sequentially from '1' through '5'. These integers represent positions within the string provided in the first column.

### Output Column Summary:

The output data is a series of single characters, each corresponding to a specific position within the string "spreadsheet" as indicated by the integer value in the second input column. The output characters are 's', 'p', 'r', 'e', and 'a', respectively, for the positions 1 through 5 in the string "spreadsheet".

### Relationship Summary:

The relationship between the input and output columns is a direct mapping of position to character within a given string. The first input column specifies the string to be analyzed, which remains constant as "spreadsheet" in this dataset. The second input column specifies the position within this string, starting from 1. The output column reveals the character found at each specified position within the string "spreadsheet". This demonstrates a clear, deterministic process where the second input column's numerical value directly determines the output character by its ordinal position in the string provided in the first input column. This relationship showcases a basic indexing operation where the index (second input column) is used to fetch a specific character from the string (first input column)., and input as ['spreadsheet', '1'] output is s, input as ['spreadsheet', '2'] output is p, input as ['spreadsheet', '3'] output is r, input as ['spreadsheet', '4'] output is e, input as ['spreadsheet', '5'] output is a, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.

def generated_function(string, position):
    """
    This function takes a string and a position as inputs and returns the character at the given position in the string.
    The position is expected to be provided as a string representing an integer, and the function converts it to an integer
    to perform the indexing operation.
    
    Args:
    - string (str): The string from which to extract a character.
    - position (str): The position of the character to extract, provided as a string.
    
    Returns:
    - char (str): The character at the specified position in the input string.
