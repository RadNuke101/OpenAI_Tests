Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Summary of Input Column Data

The input data consists of strings that represent phone numbers in an international format. Each string begins with a '+' sign, followed by the country code, a space, and then the local number divided into three groups by hyphens. The country codes vary in length, ranging from one to three digits, indicating that the phone numbers belong to different countries. The local numbers are consistently divided into three groups, with the first group containing three digits and the subsequent two groups containing three digits each. This format suggests a standardized way of representing phone numbers but with variations in the country code lengths and the use of space and hyphens as separators.

### Summary of Output Column Data

The output data retains the structure of the input data but with a change in the separators used. The '+' sign is removed, the space after the country code is eliminated, and the hyphens between the local number groups are replaced with periods. The transformation results in a continuous string of digits segmented by periods into four groups: the country code, and the three groups of the local number. This format maintains the distinction between the country code and the local number groups while adopting a more streamlined separator.

### Relationship Summary

The transformation from the input to the output format demonstrates a systematic approach to reformatting phone numbers. The key changes include:

1. **Removal of the '+' Sign**: The initial '+' sign, indicating an international number, is removed in the output. This might suggest a standardization for systems or databases where the international nature of the number is implied or where a simpler numeric format is preferred.

2. **Change of Separators**: The space after the country code and the hyphens between the local number groups in the input are replaced with periods in the output. This change suggests a preference for a consistent separator within the number, possibly for aesthetic reasons or to conform to a specific data format requirement.

3. **Preservation of Number Groups**: Despite the changes in separators, the grouping of the digits (into the country code and three local number groups) is preserved. This indicates an intention to maintain the inherent structure of the phone numbers, ensuring that the country code and the segments of the local number remain identifiable.

Overall, the transformation process appears to be a methodical reformatting aimed at standardizing the representation of international phone numbers, possibly for integration into systems that require a uniform format for data processing or display purposes., and input as ['+106 769-858-438'] output is 106.769.858.438, input as ['+83 973-757-831'] output is 83.973.757.831, input as ['+62 647-787-775'] output is 62.647.787.775, input as ['+172 027-507-632'] output is 172.027.507.632, input as ['+72 001-050-856'] output is 72.001.050.856, input as ['+95 310-537-401'] output is 95.310.537.401, input as ['+6 775-969-238'] output is 6.775.969.238, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
