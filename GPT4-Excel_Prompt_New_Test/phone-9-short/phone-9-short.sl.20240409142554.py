Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Input Column Summary:

The input data consists of strings that represent phone numbers in an international format. Each string begins with a plus sign ('+') followed by the country code, a space, and then the local number divided into three groups by hyphens ('-'). The country codes vary in length, ranging from one to three digits, indicating that the phone numbers originate from various countries. The local numbers are consistently formatted into three groups, separated by hyphens, suggesting a standardized approach to representing phone numbers within the dataset. The presence of the plus sign at the beginning of each string signifies the international dialing format, which is commonly used in global communications.

### Output Column Summary:

The output data transforms the input phone numbers into a different format. The transformation involves removing the space and hyphens from the input and replacing them with periods ('.'). This results in a continuous string of digits, segmented by periods into four groups: the country code, followed by three groups of digits representing the local number. The output retains the original digits from the input without any additions or subtractions, indicating a direct conversion from one format to another. The use of periods as separators instead of hyphens or spaces suggests a preference for a specific stylistic representation of phone numbers, possibly for consistency or readability in a particular context.

### Relationship Summary:

The relationship between the input and output data is a systematic transformation of phone number formatting from one style to another. The process involves:

1. Removing the initial space after the country code and the hyphens separating the local number groups in the input.
2. Replacing these separators with periods to demarcate the country code and the three segments of the local number in the output.

This transformation does not alter the numerical content of the phone numbers but changes their visual and structural representation. The conversion suggests a standardized format for displaying or storing phone numbers, possibly for use in a database, application, or documentation where a consistent and compact format is required. The transformation is purely stylistic and does not affect the intrinsic value or meaning of the phone numbers, maintaining their integrity as unique identifiers for telephone lines across different countries., and input as ['+106 769-858-438'] output is 106.769.858.438, input as ['+83 973-757-831'] output is 83.973.757.831, input as ['+62 647-787-775'] output is 62.647.787.775, input as ['+172 027-507-632'] output is 172.027.507.632, input as ['+72 001-050-856'] output is 72.001.050.856, input as ['+95 310-537-401'] output is 95.310.537.401, input as ['+6 775-969-238'] output is 6.775.969.238, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
