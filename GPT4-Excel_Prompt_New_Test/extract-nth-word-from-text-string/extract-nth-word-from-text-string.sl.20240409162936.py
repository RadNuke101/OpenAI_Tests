Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Input Column Summary:

The input data consists of two distinct parts: a fixed sentence and a variable number that changes across different inputs. The fixed sentence for all inputs is "you can do anything but you can't do everything." This sentence remains constant across all the examples provided. The variable part is a number that changes with each input, represented in the examples as '4', '1', '2', and '3'. These numbers are given as strings rather than numerical values. The combination of this fixed sentence and a variable number forms the basis for generating the output.

### Output Column Summary:

The output data is a single word extracted from the fixed sentence in the input data. The specific word that becomes the output is determined by the variable number in the input. Each number corresponds to the position of a word in the fixed sentence, indicating a direct relationship between the numerical value in the input and the word's position in the sentence. The outputs in the given examples are "anything," "you," "can," and "do," respectively, which are words from the fixed sentence selected based on their positional order as dictated by the variable number.

### Relationship Summary:

The relationship between the input and output data is a function of word position within a fixed sentence. The variable number in the input directly determines which word from the sentence is selected as the output. This process can be summarized as a positional selection mechanism, where the numerical value (converted from a string to an integer for practical purposes) corresponds to the order of words in the sentence, starting with '1' for the first word. This relationship showcases a straightforward mapping from a numerical identifier to a specific word based on its sequence in a predefined sentence. The mechanism does not account for the semantic meaning of the words or the sentence but strictly follows a positional selection rule., and input as ['you can do anything but you cant do everything.', '4'] output is anything, input as ['you can do anything but you cant do everything.', '1'] output is you, input as ['you can do anything but you cant do everything.', '2'] output is can, input as ['you can do anything but you cant do everything.', '3'] output is do, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
