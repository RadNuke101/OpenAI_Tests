Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Input Column Summary:

The input data consists of two distinct parts: a fixed sentence and a variable numerical value. The sentence for all inputs remains constant: "you can do anything but you cant do everything." This sentence is composed of a sequence of words that convey a motivational message about the possibilities and limitations of individual capabilities. The numerical value, which varies across different inputs, appears to serve as an index or a positional reference within the given sentence.

1. **Fixed Sentence Component**: The sentence is a structured sequence of words that remains unchanged across all inputs. It serves as the primary textual content from which the output is derived.
   
2. **Variable Numerical Component**: This component changes from one input to another and is represented as a single digit in the examples provided. It indicates a specific position or order within the sentence, suggesting its role in determining the output.

### Output Column Summary:

The output data is a single word extracted from the fixed sentence provided in the input. The word selected as output directly corresponds to the numerical value given in the input, indicating its position in the sentence. For instance, a numerical value of '1' yields "you," the first word of the sentence, as the output. This pattern is consistent across all examples, demonstrating a clear relationship between the numerical index in the input and the word position in the sentence.

### Relationship Summary:

The relationship between the input and output data is characterized by a positional mapping mechanism, where the numerical value in the input serves as a key to extract a specific word from the given sentence. This process can be summarized as follows:

- **Positional Extraction**: The numerical value provided in the input acts as an index that determines which word from the sentence is selected as the output. The counting starts from 1, aligning with the natural order of words in the sentence.
  
- **Direct Correspondence**: There is a direct and predictable correspondence between the numerical index and the word position in the sentence. This means that for any given numerical value, one can accurately predict the output word by counting the words in the sentence up to the position indicated by the number.

This relationship highlights a simple yet effective method of data extraction based on positional indexing within a fixed textual content. It underscores the importance of understanding the structure and order of elements in data processing and manipulation tasks., and input as ['you can do anything but you cant do everything.', '4'] output is anything, input as ['you can do anything but you cant do everything.', '1'] output is you, input as ['you can do anything but you cant do everything.', '2'] output is can, input as ['you can do anything but you cant do everything.', '3'] output is do, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
