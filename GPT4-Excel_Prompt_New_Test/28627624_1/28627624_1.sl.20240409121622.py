Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Summary of Input Column Data:

The input data consists of strings that follow a specific format, which includes a date and time stamp, a phone number, and a text message. The format can be broken down as follows:

1. **Date and Time Stamp**: This part of the string is formatted to show the date (in "Month Day, Year" format) followed by the time (in "Hour=Minute AM/PM" format). The date and time are crucial elements that are consistently present at the beginning of each string.

2. **Phone Number**: Following the date and time stamp, there is a separator ("-") and then a phone number. The phone number is prefixed with a country code (in this case, "+91" for India), followed by a space and then the 10-digit phone number. This part of the string indicates the sender or recipient of the message.

3. **Text Message**: After the phone number, there is another separator ("="), followed by a text message. The content of the message varies but is indicated as a placeholder text (e.g., "loren ipsum" or "loren"). This part of the string represents the body of the message.

### Summary of Output Column Data:

The output data extracts and retains only the date and time stamp from the input data, maintaining the original format ("Month Day, Year, Hour=Minute AM/PM"). This suggests that the output is focused on the timing of the message, disregarding the sender/receiver information and the content of the message itself.

### Relationship Between Input and Output:

The relationship between the input and output data highlights a process of selective information extraction. The output is derived by isolating and preserving the date and time stamp from the input, while omitting the phone number and the text message content. This indicates that the transformation process values the temporal information of the messages over the sender/receiver identity and the message content. The consistent format of the input allows for a systematic extraction of the date and time, suggesting that the primary interest or utility of the output lies in understanding or documenting the timing of these messages, possibly for chronological organization, event tracking, or temporal analysis purposes., and input as ['Dec 2, 2014, 11=23 PM - +91 90000 80000= loren ipsum'] output is Dec 2, 2014, 11=23 PM, input as ['Dec 2, 2014, 11=24 PM - +91 90000 80000= loren'] output is Dec 2, 2014, 11=24 PM, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
