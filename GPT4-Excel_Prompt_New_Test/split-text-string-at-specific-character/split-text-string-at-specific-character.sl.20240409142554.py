Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Input Column Data Summary:

The input data consists of two columns, each containing qualitative information:

1. **First Column**: The first column contains strings that represent filenames, including a date prefix (in the format DDMMYY), an underscore, and a descriptive name of the file, followed by the file extension ".xlsx". The filenames seem to be related to assignments or financial documents (e.g., "cost").

2. **Second Column**: The second column contains single-digit strings, either '1' or '2', which appear to act as selectors or indicators for the type of output desired from the processing of the first column's data.

### Output Column Data Summary:

The output data is derived from the first column's filenames based on the indicator provided in the second column. When the indicator is '1', the output is the date prefix from the filename (DDMMYY format). When the indicator is '2', the output is the descriptive name of the file along with its extension (e.g., "assignment.xlsx" or "cost.xlsx").

### Relationship Summary:

The relationship between the input and output data is a function of both the structure of the filenames in the first input column and the indicator provided in the second input column. The process can be summarized as follows:

- If the indicator is '1', the output extracts and isolates the date prefix from the filename, disregarding the rest of the filename.
- If the indicator is '2', the output extracts and isolates the descriptive name of the file and its extension, disregarding the date prefix.

This relationship indicates a conditional extraction process based on the indicator value, where the input data's structure (a combination of date, descriptive name, and file extension) is parsed and selectively outputted according to the specified criteria. This process allows for a flexible retrieval of specific parts of the filenames based on the needs indicated by the second column., and input as ['011016_assignment.xlsx', '1'] output is 011016, input as ['011016_assignment.xlsx', '2'] output is assignment.xlsx, input as ['030116_cost.xlsx', '1'] output is 030116, input as ['030116_cost.xlsx', '2'] output is cost.xlsx, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
