Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Input Column 1 Summary:

The first input column consists of filenames that appear to follow a specific naming convention, combining a date, an underscore, and a descriptor followed by the ".xlsx" file extension. The date is in the format "ddmmyy," indicating a six-digit representation of day, month, and year. The descriptor after the underscore provides a hint about the content or purpose of the Excel file, such as "assignment" or "cost." The ".xlsx" extension indicates that these files are Excel spreadsheets, a common format for storing and managing data.

### Input Column 2 Summary:

The second input column contains single-digit numerical values, specifically '1' and '2'. These values seem to act as indicators or commands that dictate what part of the filename from the first input column should be extracted and presented as the output.

### Output Column Summary:

The output column contains parts of the filenames from the first input column, determined by the value in the second input column. When the value is '1', the output is the date portion of the filename, extracted from the beginning of the filename before the underscore. When the value is '2', the output is the descriptor portion of the filename, including the ".xlsx" extension, which follows the underscore.

### Relationship Summary:

The relationship between the input columns and the output column is a conditional extraction based on the value in the second input column. The process can be summarized as follows:

- If the second input column contains the value '1', the output is generated by extracting the date portion (the first six characters) from the filename in the first input column.
- If the second input column contains the value '2', the output is generated by extracting the descriptor portion of the filename, which includes everything after the underscore up to and including the ".xlsx" extension.

This relationship indicates a structured approach to parsing and extracting specific information from a standardized filename format, based on a simple numerical command. This process could be useful in various data management or organization tasks where filenames contain structured information that needs to be separated or categorized based on its components., and input as ['011016_assignment.xlsx', '1'] output is 011016, input as ['011016_assignment.xlsx', '2'] output is assignment.xlsx, input as ['030116_cost.xlsx', '1'] output is 030116, input as ['030116_cost.xlsx', '2'] output is cost.xlsx, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
