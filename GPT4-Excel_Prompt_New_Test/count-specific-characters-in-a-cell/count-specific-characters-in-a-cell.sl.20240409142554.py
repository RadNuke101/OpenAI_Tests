Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Input Column Summary:

The input data consists of two columns. The first column contains strings, all instances of the name "Hannah". This name is consistent across all inputs, indicating that the variation in output is not due to changes in this part of the input. The second column contains single characters ('n', 'x', 'N', 'a', 'h'), which vary across inputs. These characters are both lowercase and uppercase, and they include letters that are both present and not present in the name "Hannah".

### Output Column Summary:

The output data is numerical, with values ranging from 0 to 2. These numbers represent the count of occurrences of the character specified in the second input column within the string provided in the first input column. The output values observed are 0, 1, and 2, indicating that the characters from the second input column can appear zero, once, or twice in the name "Hannah".

### Relationship Summary:

The relationship between the input and output columns is a function of character occurrence within a given string. Specifically, the output is determined by counting how many times the character specified in the second input column appears in the string "Hannah". The key observations are as follows:

1. **Case Sensitivity**: The process is case-sensitive, as demonstrated by the inputs ['Hannah', 'n'] and ['Hannah', 'N']. Despite 'n' appearing twice in "Hannah", 'N' is not counted, resulting in outputs of 2 and 0, respectively. This indicates that the character's case must match exactly for it to be counted.

2. **Character Presence**: If the specified character does not exist in the string "Hannah" (as with 'x'), the output is 0, indicating no occurrences.

3. **Multiple Occurrences**: Characters that appear more than once in "Hannah" (like 'n' and 'a') result in outputs corresponding to their number of appearances (2 in both cases). This shows that the count is cumulative and not binary.

4. **Single Occurrences**: For characters that appear only once in the name "Hannah" (such as 'h'), the output is 1, reflecting the singular occurrence.

In summary, the output is directly tied to the frequency of the specified character's occurrence in the string "Hannah", with a strict adherence to case sensitivity. This relationship is purely qualitative, focusing on the presence and frequency of specific characters within a fixed string, and it does not extend to quantitative manipulation beyond counting occurrences., and input as ['Hannah', 'n'] output is 2, input as ['Hannah', 'x'] output is 0, input as ['Hannah', 'N'] output is 0, input as ['Hannah', 'a'] output is 2, input as ['Hannah', 'h'] output is 1, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
