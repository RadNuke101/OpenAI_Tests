Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Summary of Input Data

The input data consists of two columns, where the first column contains the string 'Hannah' for every entry, and the second column contains a single character. The characters provided in the second column vary and include 'n', 'x', 'N', 'a', and 'h'. These characters represent the qualitative data that we are analyzing in relation to the string 'Hannah'. The variation in the second column is crucial as it directly influences the output based on the occurrence of these characters in the string 'Hannah'.

### Summary of Output Data

The output data is a single column that represents the count of occurrences of the character specified in the second column of the input data within the string 'Hannah'. The output values observed are 2, 0, and 1. These numbers are quantitative representations of the qualitative analysis performed on the input data, specifically showing how many times a given character appears in the string 'Hannah'.

### Relationship Between Input and Output

The relationship between the input and output is defined by the occurrence count of a specific character within a predefined string ('Hannah'). The process involves:

1. **Case Sensitivity**: The analysis is case-sensitive, as demonstrated by the difference in output for 'n' and 'N'. The character 'n' appears twice in 'Hannah', resulting in an output of 2, whereas 'N' does not appear at all, resulting in an output of 0.

2. **Character Occurrence**: The output is directly proportional to the number of times the specified character in the second column of the input data appears in the string 'Hannah'. For example, 'a' appears twice, leading to an output of 2, while 'x' does not appear, resulting in an output of 0.

3. **Specificity to 'Hannah'**: The analysis is specifically tailored to the occurrences of characters within the string 'Hannah'. This means the output is entirely dependent on the composition of this string and the character being queried.

In summary, the relationship between the input and output is a straightforward count of how many times a given character from the input appears in the string 'Hannah'. This relationship is sensitive to the case of the letters and is specific to the occurrences within the string 'Hannah' itself., and input as ['Hannah', 'n'] output is 2, input as ['Hannah', 'x'] output is 0, input as ['Hannah', 'N'] output is 0, input as ['Hannah', 'a'] output is 2, input as ['Hannah', 'h'] output is 1, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
