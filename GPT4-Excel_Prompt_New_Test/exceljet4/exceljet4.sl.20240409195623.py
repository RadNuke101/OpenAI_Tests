Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Summary of Input Column Data:

The input data consists of a series of strings that represent URLs or addresses, each prefixed with a protocol identifier followed by "://". These protocol identifiers include "https", "ftp", and "sftp", indicating the protocol used for accessing or transferring data over the internet or a network. The remainder of each string after the protocol identifier and "://" sequence is a combination of domain names, IP addresses, and potentially paths or specific pages within those domains. The data represents a variety of sources, including commercial websites (e.g., "exceljet.net" and "microsoft.com"), server addresses (e.g., "someserver.com"), and a numerical IP address ("127.0.0.1"). This variety indicates a broad range of internet or network resources, from publicly accessible websites to potentially private servers or devices identified by an IP address.

### Summary of Output Column Data:

The output data retains only the significant portion of the input URLs or addresses, specifically the domain names or IP addresses, and any paths or specific pages within those domains, if present. The protocol identifiers and the "://" sequence are removed, simplifying the original input to its essential components for identifying the resource on the internet or a network. This simplification process results in a cleaner, more concise representation of the original resources, focusing solely on the location without specifying the method of access (protocol).

### Relationship Between Input and Output:

The transformation from the input to the output data involves stripping away the protocol identifier and the "://" sequence from the original strings, leaving only the domain names, IP addresses, and any specified paths or pages. This process highlights a clear relationship where the input represents the full specification for accessing a resource on the internet or a network, including the protocol and the resource's location, while the output focuses exclusively on the location of the resource, disregarding the access method. The relationship underscores a simplification or abstraction step, moving from a detailed access specification to a straightforward identification of the resource itself. This transformation is useful for contexts where the focus is on the resource's identity rather than the specifics of how it is accessed., and input as ['https=//exceljet.net/catalog'] output is exceljet.net/catalog, input as ['https=//microsoft.com'] output is microsoft.com, input as ['ftp=//someserver.com'] output is someserver.com, input as ['sftp=//127.0.0.1'] output is 127.0.0.1, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
