Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Summary of Input Column Data:

The input data consists of a collection of strings that represent URLs or addresses, each prefixed with a protocol identifier followed by an equal sign (`=`) and two forward slashes (`//`). The protocols observed in the given examples include `https`, `ftp`, and `sftp`, indicating the method or protocol used for accessing or transferring data. The remainder of each string after the protocol identifier and slashes represents the specific address or location being referred to, which can be a domain name (e.g., `exceljet.net`, `microsoft.com`, `someserver.com`) or an IP address (`127.0.0.1`). The data is qualitative, representing different types of web or network resources identified by their access protocols and addresses.

### Summary of Output Column Data:

The output data consists of the specific addresses or locations extracted from the input data, with the protocol identifiers and the equal sign with slashes (`=//`) removed. This results in a cleaner, more focused representation of the addresses or locations themselves, without the protocol-specific prefixes. The output includes both domain names and IP addresses, indicating the core information that identifies the resources or locations being referred to. The output data is qualitative, focusing on the essential identifiers of web or network resources.

### Relationship Between Input and Output:

The relationship between the input and output data is a transformation process that extracts the core address or location information from a more complex string that also includes protocol identifiers. This process involves removing the protocol prefix (including the equal sign and slashes) from the input data to isolate and present the address or location in a simplified form. The transformation highlights the essential information (the address or location) while discarding protocol-specific details, making the output more universally understandable regardless of the specific protocol used in the input. This simplification can be particularly useful for applications or analyses that require focusing on the resources or locations themselves, rather than the methods used to access or interact with them., and input as ['https=//exceljet.net/catalog'] output is exceljet.net/catalog, input as ['https=//microsoft.com'] output is microsoft.com, input as ['ftp=//someserver.com'] output is someserver.com, input as ['sftp=//127.0.0.1'] output is 127.0.0.1, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
