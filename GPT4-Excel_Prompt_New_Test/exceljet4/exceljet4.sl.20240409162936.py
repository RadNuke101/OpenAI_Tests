Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Summary for Input Column Data:

The input data consists of a series of URLs, each prefixed with a protocol identifier followed by an equal sign (`=`) instead of the conventional colon (`:`) used in standard URL formatting. The protocols identified in the given examples include `https`, `ftp`, and `sftp`, indicating a variety of secure, standard, and file transfer protocols. The URLs themselves point to a mix of domain types, including commercial websites (`.com`), network addresses (`127.0.0.1`), and specific paths within a site (`/catalog`). This diversity suggests the input data could be from a wide range of internet or network resources, encompassing both public-facing websites and potentially private or internal network addresses.

### Summary for Output Column Data:

The output data retains the core component of each URL from the input data, specifically the domain name and any path or resource identifier following it, but stripped of the protocol prefix and the unconventional equal sign separator. This simplification process results in a cleaner, more standardized representation of the URLs, focusing on the essential elements that identify the resource location on the internet or a network. The output format is more universally recognizable and could be more easily utilized for further processing, analysis, or presentation purposes.

### Relationship Between Input and Output:

The transformation from input to output data represents a process of normalization and simplification of URL formats. By removing the protocol identifier and the equal sign, the data is converted into a more standard and accessible format. This process could serve several purposes, such as preparing the URLs for logging, analysis, or display in user interfaces where the protocol is not needed or is assumed. The relationship between the input and output highlights a focus on the essence of the web or network resource (its domain and path) over the specifics of how the resource is accessed (the protocol). This transformation suggests an underlying assumption that the primary interest lies in the resource itself, rather than the details of its retrieval or the security of its transmission., and input as ['https=//exceljet.net/catalog'] output is exceljet.net/catalog, input as ['https=//microsoft.com'] output is microsoft.com, input as ['ftp=//someserver.com'] output is someserver.com, input as ['sftp=//127.0.0.1'] output is 127.0.0.1, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
