Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Summary of Input Column Data

The input column consists of strings that are fragments of sentences or complete sentences. These strings appear to be derived from the nursery rhyme "Humpty Dumpty." The content varies from mentioning the character by name, describing an action, or detailing a consequence related to the story. The inputs range from very short phrases, such as 'humpty dumpty', to longer ones that include actions or outcomes, like 'humpty dumpty sat on a wall,' or 'couldn't put humpty together again.' The variation in length and content of these inputs suggests a focus on different aspects of the narrative or story elements.

### Summary of Output Column Data

The output column contains integers that correspond to the inputs from the input column. These integers range from 2 to 6, and they represent the count of words in each input string. The output is directly related to the length of the input in terms of the number of words present in each input string. There is a clear, linear relationship between the complexity or length of the input string and the numerical value in the output column.

### Relationship Between Input and Output

The relationship between the input and output columns is straightforward: the output is a quantitative representation of the qualitative data in the input. Specifically, the output number corresponds to the total count of words in the input string. This relationship indicates that the task is to analyze the input strings and quantify them by counting the number of words they contain. The process does not involve interpreting the meaning or context of the input beyond recognizing and counting the words. This simple yet effective relationship allows for a direct understanding of the input data's complexity or length through the output values., and input as ['humpty dumpty'] output is 2, input as ['humpty dumpty sat on a wall,'] output is 6, input as ['couldnt put humpty together again.'] output is 5, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
