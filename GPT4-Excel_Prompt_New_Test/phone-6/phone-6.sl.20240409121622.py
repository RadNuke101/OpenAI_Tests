Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Summary of Input Column Data

The input data consists of strings that follow a specific format: a plus sign (+) followed by a country code, a space, and then a phone number divided into three segments by hyphens. The country code varies in length, ranging from one to three digits. The phone number is consistently formatted as three segments: the first segment (which is of interest for the output) consists of three digits, followed by two more segments, each also consisting of three digits. The input data represents international phone numbers, with the country code indicating the country of origin and the first segment of the phone number being the focal point for generating the output.

### Summary of Output Column Data

The output data extracts and isolates the first segment of the phone number from each input string. This segment consists of three digits and is positioned immediately after the country code and space, before the first hyphen in the input string. The output ignores both the country code and the remaining segments of the phone number, focusing solely on this first segment. The output treats these numbers as qualitative data, meaning the focus is on the pattern and structure of the data rather than its numerical value.

### Relationship Between Input and Output

The relationship between the input and output data is defined by a consistent extraction process, where the output is derived by isolating a specific part of the input data. Specifically, the output captures the first segment of the phone number from the input, disregarding the country code and the rest of the phone number. This process highlights a pattern where the input serves as a structured source from which a specific qualitative piece of information (the first phone number segment) is extracted for the output. The extraction process treats the data qualitatively, focusing on the presence and position of the digits within the structured format rather than interpreting them as numerical values with inherent quantitative meaning., and input as ['+106 769-858-438'] output is 769, input as ['+83 973-757-831'] output is 973, input as ['+62 647-787-775'] output is 647, input as ['+172 027-507-632'] output is 027, input as ['+72 001-050-856'] output is 001, input as ['+95 310-537-401'] output is 310, input as ['+6 775-969-238'] output is 775, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
