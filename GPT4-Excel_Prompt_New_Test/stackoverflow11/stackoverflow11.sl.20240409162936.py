Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Input Column Summary:

The input data consists of strings that appear to be a mix of alphanumeric codes, abbreviations, and potentially meaningful words or phrases. These strings are structured but not in a uniform manner across different entries, suggesting variability in the information each string carries. The presence of both uppercase letters and numbers, along with special characters such as hyphens and underscores, indicates a coded format that might be used for identification, categorization, or tracking purposes. The data seems to contain segments that could represent codes (e.g., '2283-332-44543'), keywords (e.g., 'CAP', 'BOX'), and possibly identifiers or names (e.g., 'PPL445', 'TYYTE'). The underscore character appears to mark the end of a significant portion of the input, potentially indicating the boundary between relevant and irrelevant data for a specific context.

### Output Column Summary:

The output data extracts and presents specific segments from the input strings, suggesting a filtering or selection process based on certain criteria. These criteria seem to focus on extracting meaningful words or phrases that follow a pattern or a specific marker within the input (e.g., the underscore character). The output retains a part of the structure from the input but is more streamlined, focusing on potentially meaningful or actionable information. The outputs are cleaner, with the removal of alphanumeric codes and most abbreviations, leaving behind what appears to be names, identifiers, or key phrases (e.g., 'HEEN PAX 77820', 'PAX', 'BOX 4403 PAX SSKA').

### Relationship Between Input and Output:

The relationship between the input and output data suggests a process of extraction and refinement, where the input data is parsed to identify and isolate segments of interest based on predefined criteria. This process appears to be aimed at distilling the input down to its most relevant or meaningful components, possibly for further analysis, reporting, or operational use. The criteria for selection seem to involve identifying specific patterns or markers within the input (such as the underscore character) and extracting the information that follows these markers up to a certain point. The process effectively filters out noise and focuses on data that is presumably of higher value or relevance for the context in which it is being used. This indicates a structured approach to handling and interpreting complex, mixed-format data, aiming to simplify and clarify the information for end-users or subsequent processing stages., and input as ['2283-332-44543 CAP DDT PPL445_ HEEN PAX 77820'] output is HEEN PAX 77820, input as ['44372-33-3223 TYYTE CAP BOX 1550 244 BOX PPSSA223_ PAX'] output is PAX, input as ['PRECISE 77 CLEAR BLUE 99WIE_ BOX 4403 PAX SSKA'] output is BOX 4403 PAX SSKA, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
