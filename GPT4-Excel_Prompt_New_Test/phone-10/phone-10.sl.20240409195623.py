Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Input Column Summary:

The input data consists of a series of strings representing phone numbers in a specific format. Each entry begins with a '+' sign followed by a country code of one to three digits. After a space, the rest of the number is divided into three parts by hyphens. The first part appears to represent an area code or a similar subdivision, followed by two additional segments of the phone number. The number of digits in each segment varies, but the overall structure is consistent across all entries: a '+' sign, a country code, an area code, and two more segments of the number, all separated by spaces or hyphens.

### Output Column Summary:

The output data retains the same essential information as the input but alters the format slightly for readability or standardization purposes. The country code remains directly after the '+' sign but is now followed by a space and the area code enclosed in parentheses. The final two segments of the phone number are separated by a hyphen, as in the input. This format is more aligned with common international phone number formatting conventions, which often use parentheses to set off the area code or equivalent portion of the number.

### Relationship Summary:

The transformation from the input to the output column involves a reformatting of the phone numbers to adhere to a more standardized or widely recognized international format. The key changes include:

1. Enclosing the area code (or its equivalent) in parentheses.
2. Maintaining the separation of the last two segments of the number with a hyphen.
3. Keeping the country code directly after the '+' sign, indicating that it remains unchanged.

This reformatting does not alter the essential information contained within each phone number but rather presents it in a way that might be more immediately recognizable or understandable to an international audience. The process suggests an effort to standardize the presentation of phone numbers for clarity, ease of reading, or adherence to common formatting practices in telecommunications., and input as ['+106 769-858-438'] output is +106 (769) 858-438, input as ['+83 973-757-831'] output is +83 (973) 757-831, input as ['+62 647-787-775'] output is +62 (647) 787-775, input as ['+172 027-507-632'] output is +172 (027) 507-632, input as ['+72 001-050-856'] output is +72 (001) 050-856, input as ['+95 310-537-401'] output is +95 (310) 537-401, input as ['+6 775-969-238'] output is +6 (775) 969-238, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
