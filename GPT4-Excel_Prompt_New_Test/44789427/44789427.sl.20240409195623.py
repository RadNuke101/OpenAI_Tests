Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Input Column Summary:

The input data consists of two columns. The first column contains strings representing date ranges, while the second column contains single-digit numerical strings ('1' or '2').

1. **Date Range Column**: The date ranges are represented in two formats:
   - MM/DD/YY (e.g., '1/17/16-1/18/17')
   - MM/DD/YYYY (e.g., '01/17/2016-01/18/2017')
   
   Each entry in this column is a string that specifies a start date and an end date, separated by a hyphen ('-'). The dates within the range are in either a 2-digit year format or a 4-digit year format, with months and days possibly being zero-padded (e.g., '01' instead of '1').

2. **Selector Column**: This column contains strings that are either '1' or '2'. It serves as a selector or an indicator for which date within the range (start or end) should be outputted based on its value.

### Output Column Summary:

The output data consists of a single column that contains dates. These dates are selected from the date ranges provided in the first input column, based on the selector indicated in the second input column. The format of the output dates corresponds directly to the format of the dates within the input range they were selected from. If the input date range is in a 2-digit year format, the output date retains this format. Similarly, if the input date range uses a 4-digit year format, the output date also uses a 4-digit year format.

### Relationship Summary:

The relationship between the input and output columns is a function of selection based on the criteria provided in the second input column (the selector column). The process can be summarized as follows:

- If the selector is '1', the output is the start date of the range provided in the first input column.
- If the selector is '2', the output is the end date of the range provided in the first input column.

This relationship demonstrates a conditional extraction of data based on the input parameters, where the format of the output is directly influenced by the format of the input date range. The process effectively allows for the selection of specific parts of a qualitative data set (in this case, dates within a range) based on a simple, predefined criterion., and input as ['1/17/16-1/18/17', '1'] output is 1/17/16, input as ['1/17/16-1/18/17', '2'] output is 1/18/17, input as ['01/17/2016-01/18/2017', '1'] output is 01/17/2016, input as ['01/17/2016-01/18/2017', '2'] output is 01/18/2017, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
