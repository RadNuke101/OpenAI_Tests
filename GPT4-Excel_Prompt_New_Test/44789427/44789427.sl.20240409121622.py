Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Based on the provided examples, we can summarize the relationship between the input and output data as follows:

### Input Column Summary:

The input data consists of two columns:

1. **Date Range Column**: This column contains strings representing date ranges. The date ranges are formatted either as 'MM/DD/YY-MM/DD/YY' or 'MM/DD/YYYY-MM/DD/YYYY', indicating a start date and an end date separated by a hyphen. The format of the dates within a single range is consistent, but across different entries, it can vary between the two mentioned formats.

2. **Selection Column**: This column contains single-digit strings ('1' or '2') that indicate whether the first or the second date in the date range should be selected.

### Output Column Summary:

The output data consists of a single column:

- **Selected Date Column**: This column contains strings representing dates. The format of these dates corresponds directly to the format of the dates in the input date range. If the selection is '1', the output is the start date of the range; if the selection is '2', the output is the end date of the range. The output format (whether 'MM/DD/YY' or 'MM/DD/YYYY') matches the format of the input date range.

### Relationship Summary:

The relationship between the input and output data is a selection mechanism based on the second column of the input. The first column provides a range of dates, and the second column specifies which date within that range should be outputted. The output is always a single date, and its format is determined by the format of the input date range. This process essentially filters or selects specific dates from a given range based on a simple criterion provided in the input data., and input as ['1/17/16-1/18/17', '1'] output is 1/17/16, input as ['1/17/16-1/18/17', '2'] output is 1/18/17, input as ['01/17/2016-01/18/2017', '1'] output is 01/17/2016, input as ['01/17/2016-01/18/2017', '2'] output is 01/18/2017, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.

def generated_function(date_range, selection):
    """
    Selects a date from a given date range based on the selection criteria.

    Parameters:
    - date_range (str): A string representing a date range in the format 'MM/DD/YY-MM/DD/YY' or 'MM/DD/YYYY-MM/DD/YYYY'.
    - selection (str): A single-digit string ('1' or '2') indicating whether to select the first or second date in the range.

    Returns:
    - str: The selected date in the same format as provided in the date range.
