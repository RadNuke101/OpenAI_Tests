Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Summary for Input Column Data:

The input data consists of two columns. The first column contains strings that primarily represent names of fruits, possibly followed by numeric characters. These numeric characters, when present, are directly appended to the fruit names without any separating character. The range of these numeric characters varies, including instances where no numeric characters are present at all, as seen in the case of 'pears'. The second column contains numeric characters represented as strings. These numbers do not directly correlate with the numeric characters (if any) appended to the fruit names in the first column.

### Summary for Output Column Data:

The output data consists of a single column that contains only the names of fruits, with any numeric characters from the first input column removed. This output is purely alphabetic, indicating a process of extraction or removal of numeric characters from the first input column, disregarding the second input column entirely.

### Relationship Summary Between Input and Output:

The relationship between the input and output data suggests a processing operation that focuses solely on the first input column. This operation involves extracting the fruit names by removing any numeric characters that may be appended to them. The second column in the input data does not influence the output, indicating that its presence is not relevant to the transformation process leading to the output. The process appears to be a form of data cleaning or preparation, where the goal is to isolate qualitative descriptors (fruit names) from a mix of qualitative and quantitative data. This operation simplifies the data to a uniform format that could be useful for further analysis or categorization tasks that require only the qualitative aspect (fruit names) of the dataset., and input as ['apples30', '7'] output is apples, input as ['peaches24', '8'] output is peaches, input as ['peaches0', '8'] output is peaches, input as ['pears', '6'] output is pears, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
