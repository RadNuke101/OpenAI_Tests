Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Input Column Summary:

The input data consists of two columns. The first column contains strings that are primarily names of fruits, possibly followed by a numeric value (e.g., 'apples30', 'peaches24', 'peaches0', 'pears'). The numeric value, when present, is directly attached to the fruit name without any space. In cases where no numeric value is attached, the entry consists solely of the fruit name (e.g., 'pears'). The second column contains numeric values represented as strings (e.g., '7', '8', '6'). These values are standalone and not attached to any textual content.

### Output Column Summary:

The output data consists of a single column that contains only the names of fruits (e.g., 'apples', 'peaches', 'pears'). This output is derived from the first column of the input data, where any numeric values attached to the fruit names are removed, leaving only the textual part that represents the fruit name.

### Relationship Summary:

The relationship between the input and output data can be summarized as follows:

1. **Extraction of Fruit Names**: The primary operation that connects the input to the output is the extraction of fruit names from the first column of the input data. This involves removing any numeric characters that are attached to the fruit names, effectively isolating the textual part that represents the name of the fruit.

2. **Independence from Second Column**: The second column of the input data, which contains numeric values, does not influence the output. The output is generated solely based on the content of the first column, indicating that the transformation process is independent of the values provided in the second column.

3. **Consistency Across Variants**: Regardless of whether the fruit name in the first column of the input data is followed by a numeric value or not, the output consistently represents the fruit name without any numeric characters. This indicates a uniform processing approach that focuses on textual content extraction.

4. **Preservation of Textual Content**: The process preserves the original textual content (fruit names) from the first column while discarding numeric values. This suggests that the transformation is designed to filter out non-textual elements, focusing on retaining meaningful, qualitative data.

In summary, the relationship between the input and output data highlights a process designed to extract and preserve qualitative information (fruit names) from a mixed-format input, disregarding any quantitative elements (numeric values) that may be present., and input as ['apples30', '7'] output is apples, input as ['peaches24', '8'] output is peaches, input as ['peaches0', '8'] output is peaches, input as ['pears', '6'] output is pears, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
