Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Input Column Summary:

The input data consists of two columns. The first column contains strings that are a combination of numbers followed by alphabetic characters, representing some form of measurement or duration (e.g., '80v', '10hrs', '7h', '500m'). These strings seem to denote a quantity followed by a unit of measurement or an identifier. The second column contains numbers in string format, which appear to be unrelated to the first column's content at a glance, as they do not directly modify or affect the alphabetic part of the strings in the first column.

### Output Column Summary:

The output data is a single column that extracts and presents the alphabetic characters from the strings in the first column of the input data. This output ignores the numeric part of the input strings and focuses solely on the characters that follow, which represent units of measurement or identifiers (e.g., 'v', 'hrs', 'h', 'm').

### Relationship Summary:

The relationship between the input and the output data is a process of extraction and focus shift. The process involves taking the input strings from the first column, which are composed of both numeric and alphabetic characters, and isolating the alphabetic portion of these strings to produce the output. The second column in the input data does not influence the output, indicating that the transformation from input to output is solely based on the content of the first input column. The output essentially summarizes or highlights the type of measurement or identifier associated with the numeric value in the input without considering the magnitude of those numbers. This process underscores a qualitative analysis of the input data, emphasizing the nature or category of the measurements rather than their quantitative value., and input as ['80v', '3'] output is v, input as ['10hrs', '3'] output is hrs, input as ['7h', '2'] output is h, input as ['500m', '4'] output is m, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
