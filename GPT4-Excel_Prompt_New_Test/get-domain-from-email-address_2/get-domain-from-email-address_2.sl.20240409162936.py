Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Input Column Summary:

The input data consists of two columns, each containing qualitative information related to individuals' names and their associated email addresses or identifiers. The first column includes full names, typically formatted as "first name" followed by "last name". These names are presented in a straightforward, plain text format without any special characters or separators, other than a space between the first and last names.

The second column contains strings that appear to be either email addresses or unique identifiers related to the individuals named in the first column. These strings are more complex than the names, featuring a mix of letters, possibly the individuals' initials or parts of their names, and may include underscores, periods, or other special characters as separators. Additionally, these strings end with what seems to be domain names or extensions, suggesting an email or web identifier format.

### Output Column Summary:

The output data extracts and presents specific segments from the second input column (email addresses or identifiers). These segments seem to represent a more concise identifier for each individual, possibly serving as a username or a key part of their email address before the domain. The output retains certain characteristics from the input, such as the inclusion of periods, underscores, or other characters that were part of the original identifier, indicating that these features are significant for the uniqueness or identification purpose of the output.

### Relationship Summary:

The relationship between the input columns and the output column appears to be a process of extracting and condensing information from the second input column (the email addresses or identifiers) into a simplified form that still uniquely identifies each individual. This process selectively retains parts of the original string, such as initials, parts of the name, or specific separators like periods and underscores, which are deemed relevant for identification purposes. The first input column (full names) does not directly influence the output but provides a contextual reference for the individual associated with each email address or identifier. The transformation from input to output seems to focus on creating a more concise, easily identifiable representation of each individual, possibly for use in scenarios where a shorter identifier is needed, such as usernames or simplified email addresses., and input as ['ann chang', 'achang_maaker.com'] output is achang, input as ['bobby smith', 'bobt_sphynx.uk.co'] output is bobt, input as ['art lennox', 'art.lennox_svxn.com'] output is art.lennox, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
