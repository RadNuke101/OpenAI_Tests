Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Summary for Input Column Data:

The input column data consists of pairs of qualitative descriptors and their corresponding numerical representations. Each entry in the column is a combination of a word that represents a number in its textual form (e.g., "one", "two", "three", "four") and the actual numerical digit that represents the quantity (e.g., 1, 2, 3, 4). The data appears to follow a sequential pattern, starting from "one" and incrementing by one in both its textual and numerical forms. This pattern suggests a deliberate organization of the data to represent a simple numerical sequence in both its written and digit forms. The input data, therefore, serves as a qualitative representation of basic numerical values.

### Summary for Output Column Data:

The output column data is a list of phrases where each phrase corresponds to a specific quantity of a particular fruit. The quantities are represented by the textual form of numbers (e.g., "one", "two", "three", "four"), and each quantity is associated with a distinct type of fruit (e.g., apple, bananas, strawberries, oranges). The sequence of fruits does not follow any apparent numerical or alphabetical order but seems to be arbitrarily assigned to the numerical values from the input data. The output data, thus, provides a qualitative description of quantities of various fruits, directly linked to the numerical sequence provided in the input data.

### Relationship Between Input and Output:

The relationship between the input and output data is characterized by a direct mapping of numerical values (both in their textual and digit forms) to specific quantities of fruits. Each numerical value from the input is translated into a corresponding quantity of a particular fruit in the output. This mapping is consistent and follows a one-to-one correspondence where each unique input pair (textual and numerical representation of a number) is associated with a unique output phrase describing a quantity of fruit. The choice of fruit for each numerical value seems arbitrary and does not follow a discernible pattern based on the input data alone. However, the relationship clearly demonstrates a structured approach to linking numerical values with specific quantities of different fruits, illustrating a qualitative interpretation of numbers through the context of fruit quantities., and input as ['one, 1'] output is one apple, input as ['two, 2'] output is two bananas, input as ['three, 3'] output is three strawberries, input as ['four, 4'] output is four oranges, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
