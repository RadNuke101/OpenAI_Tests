Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Input Column Summary:

The input column consists of pairs of qualitative data that represent a combination of a written numeral (e.g., "one", "two", "three", "four") and its corresponding numeric form (e.g., 1, 2, 3, 4). Each pair is unique, covering a sequential range from one to four. The data is structured in a way that combines a textual representation of a number with its digit form, separated by a comma. This structure suggests a deliberate pairing of linguistic and numeric representations of basic integers, emphasizing a dual-format presentation of numbers within a limited range.

### Output Column Summary:

The output column contains phrases that pair each input numeral (in its textual form) with a specific type of fruit (e.g., "one apple", "two bananas", "three strawberries", "four oranges"). Each output is unique and follows a consistent pattern where the numeral is directly followed by a type of fruit, with the type of fruit changing as the numeral increases. The sequence of fruits does not follow any apparent numerical or alphabetical order but seems to be arbitrarily assigned to each numeral.

### Relationship Summary:

The relationship between the input and output columns is characterized by a direct mapping of each input pair to a specific output phrase. This mapping associates each numeral (both in its written and numeric forms) with a unique fruit, suggesting a one-to-one correspondence where the input directly determines the output. The choice of fruit for each numeral does not seem to follow any specific pattern related to the properties of the numbers or fruits themselves (e.g., size, color, nutritional value) but is instead arbitrary.

This relationship highlights a structured transformation process where the input data, which redundantly presents numbers in both textual and numeric formats, is used to generate output phrases that combine the textual numeral with a specific fruit. The transformation process emphasizes the qualitative nature of the data, treating numbers as labels or identifiers rather than quantities to be manipulated mathematically. The output serves to illustrate a simple, rule-based association where each input uniquely identifies a specific combination of a numeral and a fruit, showcasing a straightforward, if arbitrary, linkage between the input pairs and their corresponding outputs., and input as ['one, 1'] output is one apple, input as ['two, 2'] output is two bananas, input as ['three, 3'] output is three strawberries, input as ['four, 4'] output is four oranges, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
