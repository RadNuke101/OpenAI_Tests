Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Summary for Input Column Data:

The input data consists of pairs of qualitative descriptors that are closely related to each other, with the first part of each pair being a textual representation of a number (e.g., "one", "two", "three", "four") and the second part being the numeric representation of that number (e.g., "1", "2", "3", "4"). These pairs are structured in a consistent format across the dataset, where each pair is separated by a comma and encapsulated within a single list item. The sequence of these pairs follows a natural numerical order, starting from "one, 1" and incrementing by one in each subsequent pair. This pattern suggests a deliberate mapping between the textual and numeric representations of numbers, serving as a foundational structure for the dataset.

### Summary for Output Column Data:

The output data is a list of phrases where each phrase corresponds to a specific quantity of a particular fruit, with the quantity being represented by the textual version of a number (e.g., "one", "two", "three", "four") and the fruit being consistent for each specific number across the dataset. The fruits mentioned are "apple", "bananas", "strawberries", and "oranges", with each fruit being uniquely associated with a specific number. The sequence of fruits does not follow any apparent botanical or nutritional categorization but seems to be arbitrarily assigned to correspond with the input numbers. This output data structure suggests a predefined mapping between the input data and specific fruit quantities, where each input pair is directly linked to a unique output phrase.

### Relationship Summary between Input and Output:

The relationship between the input and output data is a structured and deterministic mapping, where each input pair (consisting of a textual and numeric representation of a number) is directly linked to a specific output phrase that describes a quantity of fruit. This mapping is consistent and predictable, with the textual representation of the number in the input directly influencing the quantity of fruit mentioned in the output. The numeric part of the input pair seems to serve as a validation or reinforcement of the textual part, ensuring accuracy in the mapping process. The choice of fruit for each number appears arbitrary and does not follow any discernible pattern related to the properties of the numbers or fruits themselves. Instead, the relationship is defined by a set rule where each input pair is assigned a specific fruit and quantity in the output, demonstrating a clear, rule-based connection between the input data and the corresponding output phrases., and input as ['one, 1'] output is one apple, input as ['two, 2'] output is two bananas, input as ['three, 3'] output is three strawberries, input as ['four, 4'] output is four oranges, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
