Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Summary for Input Column Data:

The input data consists of two columns, each containing qualitative, nominal data representing personal names. The first column contains given names (first names), while the second column contains family names (surnames). These names are diverse, indicating a variety of cultural backgrounds. The given names column includes names such as Nancy, Andrew, Jan, and Mariya, showcasing a mix of gender and possibly cultural origins. The family names column includes surnames like FreeHafer, Cencici, Kotas, and Sergienko, further indicating a variety of ethnic or national origins. The data in these columns are textual and are used to identify individuals uniquely.

### Summary for Output Column Data:

The output data is a single column that combines elements from both input columns to create a new format for representing names. This format includes the full given name followed by the initial of the family name, ending with a period. For example, 'Nancy FreeHafer' from the input columns is transformed into 'Nancy F.' in the output. This format provides a concise way to refer to individuals, maintaining a level of formality and privacy by not disclosing full family names. The output retains the personal identification purpose of the input while modifying the format for potentially more formal, succinct, or privacy-conscious contexts.

### Relationship Between Input and Output:

The relationship between the input and output data is a transformational one, where the input data undergoes a process to generate the output. This process involves concatenating the given name with the initial of the family name, followed by a period. This transformation suggests a purposeful modification to standardize the way names are presented, possibly for use in environments where full names are unnecessary, or privacy is a concern. The output format could be particularly useful in settings like professional communications, academic listings, or any context where a balance between identification and brevity or privacy is desired. The transformation retains essential identification information (the given name and an initial from the family name) while streamlining the format and potentially enhancing privacy or reducing the space needed for names in written materials., and input as ['Nancy', 'FreeHafer'] output is Nancy F., input as ['Andrew', 'Cencici'] output is Andrew C., input as ['Jan', 'Kotas'] output is Jan K., input as ['Mariya', 'Sergienko'] output is Mariya S., , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
