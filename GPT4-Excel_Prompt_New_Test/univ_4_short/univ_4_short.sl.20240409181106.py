Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Summary for Input Column Data

The input data consists of two columns, each representing different aspects of information related to various universities and colleges in the United States. The first column provides the names of the institutions, which include a mix of full university names (e.g., "University of Pennsylvania," "Cornell University") and abbreviations or informal names (e.g., "UCLA," "Penn"). This variety indicates that the dataset encompasses both formal and colloquial references to these institutions.

The second column specifies the locations of these institutions, presented in a format that includes the city, state abbreviation, and sometimes the country (USA). However, there is inconsistency in the presentation of the state and country information. Some entries provide full state names (e.g., "New York"), while others use state abbreviations (e.g., "NY"). Additionally, the inclusion of the country ("USA") is not consistent across all entries.

### Summary for Output Column Data

The output data standardizes the location information provided in the second input column. It consistently formats the state as an abbreviation and ensures the inclusion of "USA" for all entries, thereby addressing the inconsistencies observed in the input data. The output retains the city names as provided but modifies the state and country representations to achieve a uniform format across all entries (e.g., "New York, New York, USA" becomes "New York, NY, USA").

### Relationship Between Input and Output

The transformation from input to output demonstrates a process of standardization and normalization of location data related to various higher education institutions in the United States. The primary goal of this transformation is to achieve consistency in how the state and country information is presented. This process involves:

1. Converting full state names to their respective abbreviations, ensuring a uniform representation of state information.
2. Adding "USA" to all entries, even if the original input did not specify the country, to clarify the national context of each institution's location.
3. Retaining the city names as originally provided, as these did not require standardization.

This relationship highlights the importance of consistent data formatting, especially when dealing with qualitative information that may be presented in various forms. The output data provides a cleaner, more uniform set of location information that could be more easily utilized for mapping, data integration, or any process that benefits from standardized location formats., and input as ['University of Pennsylvania', 'Phialdelphia, PA, USA'] output is Phialdelphia, PA, USA, input as ['UCLA', 'Los Angeles, CA'] output is Los Angeles, CA, USA, input as ['Cornell University', 'Ithaca, New York, USA'] output is Ithaca, NY, USA, input as ['Penn', 'Philadelphia, PA, USA'] output is Philadelphia, PA, USA, input as ['University of Maryland College Park', 'College Park, MD'] output is College Park, MD, USA, input as ['University of Michigan', 'Ann Arbor, MI, USA'] output is Ann Arbor, MI, USA, input as ['Columbia University', 'New York, NY, USA'] output is New York, NY, USA, input as ['NYU', 'New York, New York, USA'] output is New York, NY, USA, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
