Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Input Column Summary:

The input data consists of a single column containing qualitative descriptors, specifically names of colors (e.g., 'yellow', 'gray', 'black', 'blue', 'pink', 'orange') and one non-color entry ('turkey'). These inputs are categorical in nature and represent a mix of primary colors, secondary colors, and a neutral color, along with an outlier that does not fit into the color category.

### Output Column Summary:

The output data is binary, represented by boolean values true or false. The output indicates a certain property or characteristic associated with the input, which is determined by whether the input is a certain type of color or not.

### Relationship Summary:

The relationship between the input and output suggests a pattern where certain colors are associated with a true value, while others, including a non-color entry, are associated with a false value. Specifically:

- **True Output:** The colors 'yellow', 'blue', 'pink', and 'orange' result in a true output. These colors share a common characteristic of being either primary colors (yellow, blue) or colors that can be perceived as warm or vibrant (pink, orange).
  
- **False Output:** The colors 'gray' and 'black', along with the non-color entry 'turkey', result in a false output. This suggests that neutral colors and non-color entries do not meet the criteria set for a true output.

The pattern indicates that the output might be related to the vibrancy, warmth, or the position of the color in the color spectrum (primary vs. neutral). The outlier ('turkey') confirms that the characteristic being tested is specific to colors, as it does not fit the category and thus does not meet the criteria for a true output., and input as ['yellow'] output is true, input as ['gray'] output is false, input as ['black'] output is false, input as ['blue'] output is true, input as ['pink'] output is true, input as ['orange'] output is true, input as ['turkey'] output is false, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
