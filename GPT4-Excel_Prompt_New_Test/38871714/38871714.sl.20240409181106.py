Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Summary for Input Column Data:

The input data consists of strings that include placeholders marked by angle brackets `< >`. These placeholders are embedded within sentences or expressions, indicating areas within the text that are subject to change or specification. The content within the angle brackets varies, including words and symbols, suggesting that the placeholders are used to denote variable elements, which could be anything from descriptive terms to numerical values. The structure of the input data suggests a template-like format where specific details are to be filled in or replaced, based on a certain context or criteria not provided within the input itself. The use of placeholders within a broader textual context implies that the input data serves as a flexible framework intended for further customization or modification.

### Summary for Output Column Data:

The output data represents the transformation of the input strings where the placeholders marked by angle brackets `< >` have been removed, along with the angle brackets themselves. The content that was within the brackets is retained in the output, seamlessly integrated into the surrounding text. This process effectively transforms the template-like, variable-laden input into a more finalized form of text that no longer indicates the presence of variable or changeable elements. The transformation results in sentences or expressions that appear more concrete and specific, devoid of the markers that suggest modification or filling in of details. The output maintains the original structure and meaning of the input text while eliminating the visual and syntactical cues of variability.

### Relationship Summary between Input and Output:

The relationship between the input and output data is characterized by a process of simplification and specification, where variable elements within a structured text are resolved into their specified forms. The input serves as a flexible template that accommodates variability and customization through the use of placeholders. The transformation process, which leads to the output, involves the removal of these placeholders and the integration of their content into the text, resulting in a more definitive and less variable expression. This relationship underscores a transition from potentiality to actuality, where the input's open-ended, customizable nature is refined into the output's specific and finalized form. The process highlights a method of textual manipulation and customization, where generic templates are tailored to convey particular information or details without the visual markers of modification., and input as ['This is a <string>, It should be <changed> to <a> number.'] output is This is a string, It should be changed to a number., input as ['a < 4 and a > 0'] output is a  4 and a  0, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
