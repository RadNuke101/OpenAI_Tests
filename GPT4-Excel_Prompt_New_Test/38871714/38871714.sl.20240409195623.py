Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Summary of Input Column Data:

The input data consists of strings that include placeholders marked by angle brackets `< >`. These placeholders are embedded within sentences or logical expressions, indicating areas within the text that are meant to be replaced or focused upon. The content within the angle brackets varies, including words and symbols, suggesting that the placeholders are used to denote variable parts of the sentences or expressions that are subject to change or require attention. The presence of these placeholders within a broader textual context suggests that the input data is designed to highlight or specify certain elements within the text for modification or emphasis.

### Summary of Output Column Data:

The output data retains the overall structure and content of the input data, with the significant difference being the removal of the angle brackets `< >` and their content being integrated seamlessly into the surrounding text. This transformation indicates that the process involves extracting the placeholder content and embedding it directly into the text, making the sentences or expressions complete and coherent. The output data, therefore, represents a finalized form of the input, where the previously marked variables or focus areas have been resolved or filled in, resulting in complete sentences or logical expressions without the need for further modification.

### Relationship Between Input and Output:

The relationship between the input and output data is characterized by a transformation process where specific placeholders within the input text, denoted by angle brackets, are identified, extracted, and then integrated into the surrounding text to produce a coherent and complete output. This process effectively removes the need for placeholders, resolving the text into its final form. The transformation suggests a focus on refining or completing the text by filling in or emphasizing certain parts that were initially marked as variable or subject to change. The consistent removal of angle brackets and the integration of their content into the text in the output highlight a process aimed at text clarification, completion, and the removal of ambiguity, making the information more straightforward and accessible., and input as ['This is a <string>, It should be <changed> to <a> number.'] output is This is a string, It should be changed to a number., input as ['a < 4 and a > 0'] output is a  4 and a  0, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
