'''
Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: remove spaces from the beginning and end of input, and input as: "  The shawshank" output is: The shawshank, input as: "The    godfather" output is: The godfather, input as: "    pulp   fiction" output is: pulp fiction, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above. All boolean return value should be converted to lowercase string.

# Define the generated function
def generated_function(*args):
    # Initialize an empty list to store the outputs
    outputs = []
    
    # Iterate through each input argument
    for arg in args:
        # Remove spaces from the beginning and end of the input
        output = arg.strip()
        # Append the processed input to the outputs list
        outputs.append(output)
    
    # Return the outputs list as a comma-separated string
    return ', '.join(outputs).lower()



print(generated_function("That    godfather"))  ### Output: "That    godfather"
print(generated_function("  Some text"))  ### Output: "  Some text"
print(generated_function("    pulp   novel"))  ### Output: "    pulp   novel"


print(generated_function("  The shawshank"))  ## Output: The shawshank
print(generated_function("The    godfather"))  ## Output: The godfather
print(generated_function("    pulp   fiction"))  ## Output: pulp fiction
