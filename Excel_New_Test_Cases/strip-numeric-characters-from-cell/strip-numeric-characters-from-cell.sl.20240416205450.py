'''
Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: remove the numbers from input, and input as: ['34653 jim mcdonald'] output is:  jim mcdonald, input as: ['price is 500'] output is:  price is , input as: ['100 apples'] output is:  apples, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above. All boolean return value should be converted to lowercase string.

# Define the generated function

    for arg in args:
        # Remove numbers from input
        output = ''.join([i for i in arg if not i.isdigit()])
        result.append(output.strip())
    return result



print(generated_function("34653 jim mcdonald alicned paoid"))  ### Output: "34653 jim mcdonald alicned paoid"
print(generated_function("the highest price is 500"))  ### Output: "the highest price is 500"
print(generated_function("100 bananas"))  ### Output: "100 bananas"


print(generated_function("34653 jim mcdonald"))  ## Output:  jim mcdonald
print(generated_function("price is 500"))  ## Output:  price is 
print(generated_function("100 apples"))  ## Output:  apples
