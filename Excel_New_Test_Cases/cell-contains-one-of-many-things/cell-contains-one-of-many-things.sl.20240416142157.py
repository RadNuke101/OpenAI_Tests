Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: if either the second, third, or fourth inputs (words) are in the first input (expression), return true, else false, and input as ['yellow dog on green grass', 'yellow', 'green', 'dog'] output is true, input as ['warm gray sweater', 'yellow', 'green', 'dog'] output is false, input as ['A yellow sun in a green field', 'yellow', 'green', 'dog'] output is true, input as ['yellow neon sign with a green background', 'yellow', 'green', 'dog'] output is true, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above. All boolean return value should be converted to lowercase string.

# Define the function
def generated_function(input_str, word1, word2, word3):
    # Check if any of the words are in the input expression
    if word1 in input_str or word2 in input_str or word3 in input_str:
        return 'true'
    else:
        return 'false'

# Test cases
print(generated_function('yellow dog on green grass', 'yellow', 'green', 'dog'))
print(generated_function('warm gray sweater', 'yellow', 'green', 'dog'))
print(generated_function('A yellow sun in a green field', 'yellow', 'green', 'dog'))
print(generated_function('yellow neon sign with a green background', 'yellow', 'green', 'dog'))



print(generated_function("blue dog on yellow grass", "yellow", "green", "dog"))  ### Output: "blue dog on yellow grass", "yellow", "green", "dog"
print(generated_function("Neon sign with a green background", "yellow", "green", "dog"))  ### Output: "Neon sign with a green background", "yellow", "green", "dog"
print(generated_function("N/A", "yellow", "green", "dog"))  ### Output: "N/A", "yellow", "green", "dog"
print(generated_function("Cold white sweater", "yellow", "green", "dog"))  ### Output: "Cold white sweater", "yellow", "green", "dog"
print(generated_function("A yellow sun in a field", "yellow", "green", "dog"))  ### Output: "A yellow sun in a field", "yellow", "green", "dog"


print(generated_function("yellow dog on green grass", "yellow", "green", "dog"))  ## Output: true
print(generated_function("warm gray sweater", "yellow", "green", "dog"))  ## Output: false
print(generated_function("A yellow sun in a green field", "yellow", "green", "dog"))  ## Output: true
print(generated_function("yellow neon sign with a green background", "yellow", "green", "dog"))  ## Output: true
