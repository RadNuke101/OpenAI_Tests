Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Summary for Input Column Data:
- The input column data consists of strings that contain a mix of letters and numbers.
- The strings vary in length and do not follow a specific pattern.

Summary for Output Column Data:
- The output column data consists of boolean values (true or false) based on certain criteria.
- The criteria for determining the output value is not explicitly mentioned.

Relationship between Input and Output:
- Based on the provided examples, it seems that the output value is determined by the presence of a certain pattern or sequence of characters in the input string.
- The output is 'true' when the input string contains a specific pattern or sequence, and 'false' when it does not.
- The relationship between the input and output is based on the content or structure of the input string rather than any quantitative or numerical data., and input as ['dhfjd9999999dfda'] output is true, input as ['ddsss999dfdfsfd'] output is false, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
