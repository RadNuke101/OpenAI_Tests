Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Summary for Input Column Data:
- The input column data consists of file paths in the format 'c=/users/dave/filename.xls'.
- Each input represents a different Excel file with a specific name at the end of the path.

Summary for Output Column Data:
- The output column data consists of the file names extracted from the input paths.
- Each output represents the specific file name of the corresponding input Excel file.

Relationship between Input and Output:
- The relationship between the input and output is that the output column contains only the file names extracted from the input paths.
- The output column serves as a simplified version of the input paths, focusing solely on the specific file names without the additional path information.
- This relationship allows for easier identification and reference to the specific Excel files represented by the input paths., and input as ['c=/users/dave/shotcut.xls'] output is shotcut.xls, input as ['c=/users/dave/formulas.xls'] output is formulas.xls, input as ['c=/users/dave/pivot table.xls'] output is pivot table.xls, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
