Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Summary for Input Column Data:
- The first input column data is 'The'.
- The second input column data is 'The quick fox'.
- The third input column data is 'The quick  fox'.

Summary for Output Column Data:
- The output values are 3, 13, and 14.

Relationship between Input and Output:
- The length of the input strings seems to have a direct relationship with the output values.
- The output value increases as the length of the input string increases.
- There is a positive correlation between the length of the input string and the output value., and input as ['The'] output is 3, input as ['The quick fox'] output is 13, input as ['The quick  fox'] output is 14, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.

# Define the generated function
def generated_function(input_str):
    # Calculate the length of the input string
    length = len(input_str)
    
    # Return the calculated length as the output value
    return length

# Test cases
output1 = generated_function('The')  # Output should be 3
output2 = generated_function('The quick fox')  # Output should be 13
output3 = generated_function('The quick  fox')  # Output should be 14
print(generated_function("The"))  ## Output: 3
print(generated_function("The quick fox"))  ## Output: 13
print(generated_function("The quick  fox"))  ## Output: 14
