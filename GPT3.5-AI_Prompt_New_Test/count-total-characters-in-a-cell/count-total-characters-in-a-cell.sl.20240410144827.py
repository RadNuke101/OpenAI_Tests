Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Summary for Input Column Data:
- The input column data consists of phrases or sentences.
- The length of the input varies based on the number of words and spaces in each phrase or sentence.

Summary for Output Column:
- The output column represents the total number of characters in each input phrase or sentence.
- The output values are influenced by the length of the input, including the number of words and spaces.

Relationship between Input and Output:
- The length of the input phrases or sentences directly impacts the output value.
- The output value is determined by counting the total number of characters in the input, including letters, spaces, and punctuation.
- Longer input phrases or sentences result in higher output values, as there are more characters to count., and input as ['The'] output is 3, input as ['The quick fox'] output is 13, input as ['The quick  fox'] output is 14, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.

# Define the generated function
def generated_function(*args):
    # Initialize a variable to store the total number of characters
    total_chars = 0
    
    # Iterate through each input argument
    for arg in args:
        # Count the total number of characters in the input argument
        total_chars += len(arg)
    
    # Return the total number of characters
    return total_chars

# Test cases
print(generated_function('The')) # Output: 3
print(generated_function('The quick fox')) # Output: 13
print(generated_function('The quick  fox')) # Output: 14
print(generated_function("The"))  ## Output: 3
print(generated_function("The quick fox"))  ## Output: 13
print(generated_function("The quick  fox"))  ## Output: 14
