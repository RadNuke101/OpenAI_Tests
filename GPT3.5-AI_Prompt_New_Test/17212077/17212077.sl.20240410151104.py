Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Summary for Input Column Data:
- The input column data consists of dates in the format MM/DD/YYYY.
- The input data represents specific dates in the past.
- Each input value consists of a month, day, and year.

Summary for Output Column Data:
- The output column data consists of dates in the format MM/YYYY.
- The output data represents a generalization of the input dates by omitting the day.
- The output values provide a broader view of time by focusing on the month and year only.

Relationship between Input and Output:
- The relationship between the input and output is that the output simplifies the input data by removing the specific day information.
- The output column provides a more generalized view of time compared to the input column.
- By focusing on the month and year only, the output allows for easier comparison and analysis of trends over time., and input as ['01/15/2013'] output is 01/2013, input as ['03/07/2011'] output is 03/2011, input as ['05/09/2009'] output is 05/2009, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.

# Define the generated function

    # Split the input date into month, day, and year
    month, day, year = input_date.split('/')
    # Return the output in the format MM/YYYY
    return f"{month}/{year}"

# Test cases
