Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Summary for Input Column Data:
- The input column data consists of dates in the format MM/DD/YYYY.
- Each date represents a specific point in time.

Summary for Output Column Data:
- The output column data consists of dates in the format MM/YYYY.
- The output column data represents the month and year of the corresponding input date.

Relationship between Input and Output:
- The output column data is derived from the input column data by extracting only the month and year information.
- The relationship between the input and output is that the output provides a simplified version of the input, focusing only on the month and year.
- The output serves as a summary or condensed representation of the input, making it easier to compare and analyze the data at a higher level., and input as ['01/15/2013'] output is 01/2013, input as ['03/07/2011'] output is 03/2011, input as ['05/09/2009'] output is 05/2009, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.

# Define the generated function
def generated_function(input_date):
    # Split the input date by '/' and extract the month and year
    month, _, year = input_date.split('/')
    # Return the month and year in the desired format
    return f"{month}/{year}"

# Test cases
print(generated_function('01/15/2013')) # Output: 01/2013
print(generated_function('03/07/2011')) # Output: 03/2011
print(generated_function('05/09/2009')) # Output: 05/2009
print(generated_function("01/15/2013"))  ## Output: 01/2013
print(generated_function("03/07/2011"))  ## Output: 03/2011
print(generated_function("05/09/2009"))  ## Output: 05/2009
