Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Summary for Input Column 1:
The input column data consists of descriptions related to different car parts or maintenance tasks. Each description includes a combination of letters and numbers, with a specific code embedded within the text.

Summary for Output Column:
The output column consists of the extracted codes from the input descriptions. These codes are alphanumeric sequences that are unique identifiers for different car parts or maintenance tasks.

Relationship between Input and Output:
The input descriptions provide context and details about various car parts or maintenance tasks, while the output codes serve as specific identifiers for these components. By extracting the codes from the input descriptions, we can easily reference and identify the corresponding car parts or maintenance tasks. The relationship between the input and output is that the codes extracted from the input descriptions help in categorizing and organizing the information related to car parts and maintenance tasks., and input as ['Tire Pressure ABC123873 Monitor'] output is ABC123873, input as [' Oil Life ABC849999999021 gauge'] output is ABC849999999021, input as [' Air conditioner GHF211 maintenance'] output is GHF211, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
