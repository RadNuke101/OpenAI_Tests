Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Summary for input column data:
- The input column data consists of descriptions of different automotive components or maintenance tasks.
- The data includes phrases such as "Tire Pressure Monitor," "Oil Life gauge," and "Air conditioner maintenance."

Summary for output column data:
- The output column data consists of alphanumeric codes such as ABC123873, ABC849999999021, and GHF211.
- The codes appear to be unique identifiers or serial numbers associated with the automotive components or maintenance tasks described in the input column data.

Relationship between input and output:
- The alphanumeric codes in the output column seem to correspond to specific components or tasks mentioned in the input column data.
- The codes likely serve as identifiers or references for the different automotive items or maintenance activities described in the input data.
- The output codes may be used for tracking, inventory management, or maintenance record-keeping purposes based on the input descriptions provided., and input as ['Tire Pressure ABC123873 Monitor'] output is ABC123873, input as [' Oil Life ABC849999999021 gauge'] output is ABC849999999021, input as [' Air conditioner GHF211 maintenance'] output is GHF211, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
