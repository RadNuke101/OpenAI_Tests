Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Summary for Input Column 1:
- The input column data consists of descriptions related to different car parts or maintenance tasks.
- The format of the input data is consistent, with each description starting with the name of the car part or maintenance task followed by a code.

Summary for Output Column:
- The output column consists of alphanumeric codes extracted from the input descriptions.
- The codes in the output column are a combination of letters and numbers, with varying lengths.

Relationship between Input and Output:
- The output column contains alphanumeric codes that are extracted from the input descriptions.
- The codes in the output column seem to be unique identifiers or serial numbers associated with the car parts or maintenance tasks mentioned in the input descriptions.
- The output column serves as a way to categorize or identify the different car parts or maintenance tasks mentioned in the input data., and input as ['Tire Pressure ABC123873 Monitor'] output is ABC123873, input as [' Oil Life ABC849999999021 gauge'] output is ABC849999999021, input as [' Air conditioner GHF211 maintenance'] output is GHF211, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.

# Define the generated function
def generated_function(input_str):
    # Split the input string to extract the alphanumeric code
    code = input_str.split()[-1]
    
    # Return the extracted code
    return code

# Test cases
