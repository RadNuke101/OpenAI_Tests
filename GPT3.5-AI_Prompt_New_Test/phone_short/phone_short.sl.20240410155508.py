Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Summary for Input Column Data:
- The input column data consists of phone numbers in the format XXX-XXX-XXX.
- Each phone number is unique and does not repeat in the dataset.
- The first three digits of each phone number vary, indicating different area codes.

Summary for Output Column:
- The output column consists of the first three digits of each phone number in the input column.
- The output represents the area code of each phone number.
- The relationship between the input and output is that the output is derived from the first three digits of the input phone number, specifically the area code.

Relationship between Input and Output:
- The output column (area code) is directly related to the input column (phone numbers).
- The area code is extracted from the first three digits of each phone number in the input column.
- The output serves as a way to categorize and identify the geographic location associated with each phone number in the input column., and input as ['938-242-504'] output is 938, input as ['308-916-545'] output is 308, input as ['623-599-749'] output is 623, input as ['981-424-843'] output is 981, input as ['118-980-214'] output is 118, input as ['244-655-094'] output is 244, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
