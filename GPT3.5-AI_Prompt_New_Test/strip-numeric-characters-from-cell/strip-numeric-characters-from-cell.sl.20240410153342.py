Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Summary for Input Column 1: 
- The input column contains various pieces of information such as names, prices, and quantities. 
- The data in this column is a mix of qualitative information, including names like "jim mcdonald" and items like "apples."

Summary for Output Column:
- The output column contains a mix of words and phrases that are related to the input data. 
- The output seems to be a combination of the last word or phrase in the input data, which may indicate a pattern or relationship between the input and output.

Relationship between Input and Output:
- The output column appears to be derived from the last word or phrase in the input data. 
- This suggests that the output is related to the final piece of information provided in the input. 
- The output seems to be a simplified version of the last word or phrase in the input, possibly indicating a summarization or extraction process., and input as ['34653 jim mcdonald'] output is  jim mcdonald, input as ['price is 500'] output is  price is , input as ['100 apples'] output is  apples, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.

# Define the generated function

    outputs = []
    for arg in args:
        input_data = arg.split()
        output_data = input_data[-1]
        outputs.append(output_data)
    return outputs

# Test cases
print(generated_function('34653 jim mcdonald'))  # Output: ['mcdonald']
print(generated_function('price is 500'))  # Output: ['500']
print(generated_function('100 apples'))  # Output: ['apples']
print(generated_function("34653 jim mcdonald"))  ## Output:  jim mcdonald
print(generated_function("price is 500"))  ## Output:  price is 
print(generated_function("100 apples"))  ## Output:  apples
