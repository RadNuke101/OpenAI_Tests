Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Summary for Input Column Data:
- The input column data consists of phone numbers in the format XXX-XXX-XXX.
- Each phone number is unique and does not repeat within the dataset.
- The first set of numbers in each phone number seems to vary widely, with no clear pattern or trend.

Summary for Output Column Data:
- The output column data consists of the middle set of numbers in each phone number.
- The middle set of numbers varies between 242, 916, 599, 424, 980, and 655.
- There is no apparent sequential or numerical relationship between the middle set of numbers in the input and the output.

Relationship between Input and Output:
- The output column data seems to be randomly selected from the middle set of numbers in each phone number.
- There is no discernible pattern or rule that determines how the middle set of numbers in the input corresponds to the output.
- The relationship between the input and output appears to be arbitrary and not based on any logical sequence or pattern., and input as ['938-242-504'] output is 242, input as ['308-916-545'] output is 916, input as ['623-599-749'] output is 599, input as ['981-424-843'] output is 424, input as ['118-980-214'] output is 980, input as ['244-655-094'] output is 655, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
