Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: For the input column data, it appears that each entry consists of three sets of numbers separated by hyphens. The first set of numbers seems to vary across entries, while the second set of numbers remains constant at 3 digits. The third set of numbers also varies across entries. 

As for the output column, it appears to be the middle set of numbers from each input entry. This middle set of numbers seems to be the focus or target of the relationship between the input and output columns. The middle set of numbers in the input column seems to determine the value in the output column.

Overall, the relationship between the input and output columns seems to involve extracting the middle set of numbers from each input entry to generate the corresponding output. This suggests a pattern where the middle set of numbers plays a significant role in determining the final output value., and input as ['938-242-504'] output is 242, input as ['308-916-545'] output is 916, input as ['623-599-749'] output is 599, input as ['981-424-843'] output is 424, input as ['118-980-214'] output is 980, input as ['244-655-094'] output is 655, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
