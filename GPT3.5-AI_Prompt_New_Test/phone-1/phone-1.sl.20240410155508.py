'''
Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Summary for Input Column Data:
- The input column data consists of phone numbers in the format '###-###-###'.
- Each phone number is unique and does not repeat in the dataset.
- The first set of numbers in each phone number seems to be random and varies across the dataset.
- The second set of numbers in each phone number appears to be the focus of attention as it is consistently mentioned in the output column.

Summary for Output Column Data:
- The output column data consists of the middle set of numbers from each phone number in the input column.
- The middle set of numbers seems to be the key information that is being highlighted or extracted from the phone numbers.
- The middle set of numbers varies across the dataset and does not follow a specific pattern or sequence.
- The middle set of numbers is the main focus of attention in the relationship between the input and output columns.

Relationship between Input and Output:
- The relationship between the input and output columns is that the middle set of numbers from each phone number in the input column is being extracted and highlighted in the output column.
- The middle set of numbers serves as a key identifier or reference point in the dataset.
- The input column provides context with the full phone numbers, while the output column focuses on a specific part of the phone numbers.
- The output column seems to be emphasizing the middle set of numbers as important or relevant information within the dataset., and input as ['938-242-504'] output is 242, input as ['308-916-545'] output is 916, input as ['623-599-749'] output is 599, input as ['981-424-843'] output is 424, input as ['118-980-214'] output is 980, input as ['244-655-094'] output is 655, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
