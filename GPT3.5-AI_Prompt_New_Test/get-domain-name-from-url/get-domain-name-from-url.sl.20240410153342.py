Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Summary for Input Column Data:
- The input column data consists of URLs in the format 'protocol=//domain/path'.
- Each URL contains a protocol (http or https), a domain, and a path.
- The URLs vary in terms of the domain and path specified.

Summary for Output Column Data:
- The output column data consists of URLs with the protocol and domain extracted from the input URLs.
- The paths from the input URLs are removed in the output.

Relationship between Input and Output:
- The output URLs are derived from the input URLs by extracting the protocol and domain while removing the path.
- The relationship between the input and output is that the output provides a cleaner version of the input URLs with only the essential protocol and domain information., and input as ['https=//abc.com/def'] output is https=//abc.com/, input as ['http=//www.abc.com/def/cef'] output is http=//www.abc.com, input as ['http=//chandoo.org/wp/def-def'] output is http=//chandoo.org/, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.

# Define the generated function

    # Split the input string into protocol, domain, and path
    parts = input_str.split('=')
    protocol = parts[0]
    domain = parts[1].split('/')[0]
    
    # Construct the output URL with protocol and domain only
    output = f"{protocol}={domain}/"
    
    return output

# Test cases
print(generated_function('https=//abc.com/def')) # Output: https=//abc.com/
print(generated_function('http=//www.abc.com/def/cef')) # Output: http=//www.abc.com
