Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Summary for Input Column Data:
- The input column data consists of URLs with various formats, including 'https=//abc.com/def', 'http=//www.abc.com/def/cef', and 'http=//chandoo.org/wp/def-def'.
- Each input contains a protocol (http or https), a domain name, and a path.

Summary for Output Column Data:
- The output column data consists of the domain name extracted from the input URLs, such as 'https=//abc.com/', 'http=//www.abc.com', and 'http=//chandoo.org/'.
- The output column focuses on the domain name part of the input URLs.

Relationship between Input and Output:
- The output column data shows the domain name extracted from the input URLs by removing the path and keeping the protocol.
- The relationship between the input and output is that the output column simplifies the input URLs by only displaying the domain name, which is the main focus of the URLs., and input as ['https=//abc.com/def'] output is https=//abc.com/, input as ['http=//www.abc.com/def/cef'] output is http=//www.abc.com, input as ['http=//chandoo.org/wp/def-def'] output is http=//chandoo.org/, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
