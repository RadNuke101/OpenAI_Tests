'''
Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Summary for Input Column 1: The input column consists of a famous quote "you can do anything but you can't do everything." Each word in the quote represents a different idea or concept.

Summary for Input Column 2: The input column consists of single-digit numbers representing the position of a word in the quote "you can do anything but you can't do everything."

Summary for Output Column: The output column consists of individual words extracted from the quote based on the position provided in the corresponding input column. The output words represent a sequence of ideas or actions.

Relationship between Input and Output: The input column provides a quote with various ideas and concepts, while the output column extracts specific words from the quote based on the position provided in the input column. The relationship between the input and output is that the output words are selected from the input quote based on their position, showcasing a connection between the two columns., and input as ['you can do anything but you cant do everything.', '4'] output is anything, input as ['you can do anything but you cant do everything.', '1'] output is you, input as ['you can do anything but you cant do everything.', '2'] output is can, input as ['you can do anything but you cant do everything.', '3'] output is do, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.

# Define the generated function

    # Split the input string into words
    words = input_str.split()
    
    # Extract the word based on the position provided
    output = words[int(position) - 1]
    
    return output
