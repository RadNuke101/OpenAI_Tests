Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Summary for Input Column 1: The input column consists of sentences or phrases that convey a message or idea. Each input represents a different statement or thought.

Summary for Output Column: The output column consists of individual words extracted from the input sentences. Each word represents a specific part of the input sentence.

Relationship Summary: The output column contains words that are extracted from the input sentences. Each word in the output column corresponds to a specific position in the input sentence. The relationship between the input and output is that the output words are derived from the input sentences, with each word representing a distinct element of the input statement., and input as ['you can do anything but you cant do everything.', '4'] output is anything, input as ['you can do anything but you cant do everything.', '1'] output is you, input as ['you can do anything but you cant do everything.', '2'] output is can, input as ['you can do anything but you cant do everything.', '3'] output is do, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.

# Define the generated function
def generated_function(input_str, position):
    # Split the input sentence into words
    words = input_str.split()
    
    # Return the word at the specified position
    return words[position-1]

# Test cases
print(generated_function('you can do anything but you cant do everything.', 4)) # Output: anything
print(generated_function('you can do anything but you cant do everything.', 1)) # Output: you
print(generated_function('you can do anything but you cant do everything.', 2)) # Output: can
print(generated_function('you can do anything but you cant do everything.', 3)) # Output: do
print(generated_function("you can do anything but you cant do everything.", "4"))  ## Output: anything
