'''
Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Summary for Input Column 1: The input column consists of a quote "you can do anything but you can't do everything." Each word in the quote represents a different possibility or limitation.

Summary for Input Column 2: The input column consists of numbers ranging from 1 to 4. These numbers likely represent the position of a word in the quote.

Summary for Output Column: The output column displays a single word from the quote based on the corresponding number in the input column. The output provides a specific word from the quote, indicating a selection or choice made from the possibilities presented in the input.

Relationship between Input and Output: The input column provides a range of possibilities and limitations, while the output column selects a specific word from the quote based on the corresponding number. This relationship suggests a decision-making process where a choice is made from the various options available. The output column reflects a decision or selection made from the input column's range of possibilities., and input as ['you can do anything but you cant do everything.', '4'] output is anything, input as ['you can do anything but you cant do everything.', '1'] output is you, input as ['you can do anything but you cant do everything.', '2'] output is can, input as ['you can do anything but you cant do everything.', '3'] output is do, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
