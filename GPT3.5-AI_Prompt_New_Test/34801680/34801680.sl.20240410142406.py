Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Input Column Summary:
- The input column data consists of company names, with the format 'Name= Company Name'. The company names include ABC Retailers and XYZ Suppliers.

Output Column Summary:
- The output column consists of the company names extracted from the input column data. The output includes ABC Retailers and XYZ Suppliers.

Relationship Summary:
- The relationship between the input and output columns is that the output column directly reflects the company names mentioned in the input column data. The input column provides the full company name with additional text, while the output column extracts and displays only the company name itself. This relationship shows how the input data is processed to generate a clear and concise output., and input as ['Name= ABC Retailers'] output is ABC Retailers, input as [' ame= XYZ Suppliers'] output is XYZ Suppliers, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
