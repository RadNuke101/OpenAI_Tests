Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Input Column Summary:
- The input column contains names of different retailers or suppliers.
- The names are preceded by the string 'Name=' or ' ame=', indicating a potential data entry error in the second case.

Output Column Summary:
- The output column contains the corrected names of retailers or suppliers.
- The corrections involve removing the unnecessary characters 'Name=' or ' ame=' from the input names.

Relationship Summary:
- The relationship between the input and output columns is that the output column provides the corrected names by removing the unnecessary characters from the input names.
- The corrections made in the output column ensure that the names are accurately represented without any errors or typos., and input as ['Name= ABC Retailers'] output is ABC Retailers, input as [' ame= XYZ Suppliers'] output is XYZ Suppliers, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
