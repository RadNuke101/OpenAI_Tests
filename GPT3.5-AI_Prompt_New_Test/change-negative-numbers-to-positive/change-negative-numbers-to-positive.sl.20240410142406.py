Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Summary for Input Column Data:
- The input column data consists of qualitative values representing different numbers with varying formats such as negative numbers, positive numbers, and decimal numbers.

Summary for Output Column Data:
- The output column data consists of qualitative values representing the same numbers as the input column data but in a standardized format with the removal of special characters like '%'.

Relationship between Input and Output:
- The relationship between the input and output columns is that the output column data is a cleaned and standardized version of the input column data. The output column data removes any special characters and formats the numbers uniformly, making it easier to interpret and analyze., and input as ['-%134'] output is %134, input as ['500'] output is 500, input as ['5.125'] output is 5.125, input as ['-%43.00'] output is %43.00, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.

# Define the generated function
def generated_function(input_str):
    # Remove special characters and return the standardized output
    return input_str.replace('%', '').replace('-', '')

# Test cases
print(generated_function('-%134'))  # Output: 134
print(generated_function('500'))     # Output: 500
print(generated_function('5.125'))   # Output: 5.125
print(generated_function('-%43.00')) # Output: 43.00
print(generated_function("-%134"))  ## Output: %134
print(generated_function("500"))  ## Output: 500
print(generated_function("5.125"))  ## Output: 5.125
print(generated_function("-%43.00"))  ## Output: %43.00
