Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Summary for Input Column Data:
- The input column data consists of qualitative values representing various numbers with symbols such as % and -. The values include integers, decimals, and negative numbers.

Summary for Output Column Data:
- The output column data consists of qualitative values representing numbers without any symbols. The values include integers, decimals, and negative numbers.

Relationship between Input and Output:
- The input column data includes various formats of numbers with symbols, while the output column data represents the same numbers without symbols. The relationship between the input and output is that the output column data is a cleaned-up version of the input column data, removing any symbols and formatting to present the numbers in a standardized format., and input as ['-%134'] output is %134, input as ['500'] output is 500, input as ['5.125'] output is 5.125, input as ['-%43.00'] output is %43.00, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
