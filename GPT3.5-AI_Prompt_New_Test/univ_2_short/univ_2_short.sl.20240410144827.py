Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Summary for Input Column Data:
- The input column data consists of the names of various universities or educational institutions along with their locations.
- The locations include cities, states, and sometimes countries.

Summary for Output Column Data:
- The output column data includes the names of universities or educational institutions along with their locations, followed by the country name "USA" in all cases.

Relationship between Input and Output:
- The relationship between the input and output is that the input provides the name and location of the university or educational institution, while the output includes the same information along with the country name "USA" appended at the end.
- The output column consistently adds "USA" to the end of the location information provided in the input column, indicating that all the universities listed are located in the United States.
- This relationship suggests that the output is a standardized format that ensures the country of location is explicitly stated for each university or educational institution mentioned in the input., and input as ['University of Pennsylvania', 'Phialdelphia, PA, USA'] output is University of Pennsylvania, Phialdelphia, PA, USA, input as ['UCLA', 'Los Angeles, CA'] output is UCLA, Los Angeles, CA, USA, input as ['Cornell University', 'Ithaca, New York, USA'] output is Cornell University, Ithaca, New York, USA, input as ['Penn', 'Philadelphia, PA, USA'] output is Penn, Philadelphia, PA, USA, input as ['University of Maryland College Park', 'College Park, MD'] output is University of Maryland College Park, College Park, MD, USA, input as ['University of Michigan', 'Ann Arbor, MI, USA'] output is University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
