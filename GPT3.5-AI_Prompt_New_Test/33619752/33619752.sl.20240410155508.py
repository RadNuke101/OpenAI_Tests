Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Summary for Input Column Data:
- The input column data consists of various company names such as General Electric, Microsoft, and Nintendo.
- Some company names include additional terms like Inc, Corporation, and Enterprises.

Summary for Output Column Data:
- The output column consists of the cleaned-up company names without additional terms like Inc, Corporation, or Enterprises.
- The output column includes General Electric, Microsoft, and Nintendo.

Relationship between Input and Output:
- The relationship between the input and output is that the output column contains the cleaned-up versions of the company names from the input column.
- The output column simplifies the company names by removing any additional terms or variations, resulting in a standardized format for each company., and input as ['General Electric'] output is General Electric, input as ['General Electric Inc'] output is General Electric, input as ['General Electric Company'] output is General Electric, input as ['Microsoft'] output is Microsoft, input as ['Microsoft Corporation'] output is Microsoft, input as ['Nintendo'] output is Nintendo, input as ['Nintendo Enterprises'] output is Nintendo, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
