Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Summary for Input Column Data:
- The input column data consists of various company names such as General Electric, Microsoft, and Nintendo. Some entries include additional terms like Inc, Corporation, and Enterprises.

Summary for Output Column:
- The output column consists of the cleaned-up company names, where any additional terms like Inc, Corporation, or Enterprises have been removed.

Relationship between Input and Output:
- The relationship between the input and output is that the output column contains the cleaned-up versions of the company names from the input column. The cleaning process involves removing any additional terms to standardize the company names. This ensures consistency and clarity in the data., and input as ['General Electric'] output is General Electric, input as ['General Electric Inc'] output is General Electric, input as ['General Electric Company'] output is General Electric, input as ['Microsoft'] output is Microsoft, input as ['Microsoft Corporation'] output is Microsoft, input as ['Nintendo'] output is Nintendo, input as ['Nintendo Enterprises'] output is Nintendo, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
