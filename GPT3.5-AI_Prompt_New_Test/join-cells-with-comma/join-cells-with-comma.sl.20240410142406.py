'''
Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Summary for Input Column 1: The first input column contains a list of fruits, including figs, an empty string, and apples.

Summary for Input Column 2: The second input column contains a list of fruits, including mangos, kiwis, and grapes.

Summary for Output Column: The output column contains a list of fruits that correspond to the input columns, including figs, apples, mangos, kiwis, and grapes.

Relationship between Input and Output: The input columns consist of different types of fruits, and the output column combines all the fruits from both input columns. The output column serves as a comprehensive list of all the fruits mentioned in the input columns., and input as ['figs', '', 'apples'] output is figs, apples, input as ['mangos', 'kiwis', 'grapes'] output is mangos, kiwis, grapes, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.

    input2_list = input2.split(', ')
    
    # Combine the lists of fruits
    output_list = input1_list + input2_list
    
    # Remove any empty strings from the output list
    output_list = [fruit for fruit in output_list if fruit != '']
    
    # Return the combined list of fruits as a string
    return ', '.join(output_list)

# Test cases
input1_test1 = 'figs, , apples'
input2_test1 = 'mangos, kiwis, grapes'
generated_function(input1_test1, input2_test1)
print(generated_function("figs", "", "apples"))  ## Output: figs, apples
print(generated_function("mangos", "kiwis", "grapes"))  ## Output: mangos, kiwis, grapes
