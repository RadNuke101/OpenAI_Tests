Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Summary for Input Column Data:
- The input column data consists of phrases or sentences.
- Each row in the input column data contains a phrase or sentence along with a specific word or phrase to be searched for within that sentence.

Summary for Output Column Data:
- The output column data consists of boolean values (true or false) indicating whether the search term was found in the corresponding input sentence.

Relationship between Input and Output:
- The relationship between the input and output is based on whether the search term provided in the input sentence is found within that sentence.
- If the search term is found in the input sentence, the output is true; otherwise, it is false.
- The output serves as a confirmation of whether the specified word or phrase exists within the given sentence in the input data., and input as ['An apple a day keeps the doctor away', 'apple'] output is true, input as ['An apple a day keeps the doctor away', 'orange'] output is false, input as ['Better the devil you know', 'you know'] output is true, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
