Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Input Column Summary:
- The input column data consists of full names of individuals.
- Each name appears to have a first name followed by a last name.

Output Column Summary:
- The output column consists of only the first names extracted from the input column data.

Relationship Summary:
- The relationship between the input and output columns is that the output column extracts and displays only the first names from the input column data.
- The output column serves as a simplified version of the input column, focusing solely on the first names of the individuals.
- This relationship allows for a more concise and straightforward representation of the data, making it easier to identify and refer to individuals by their first names., and input as ['Nancy FreeHafer'] output is Nancy, input as ['Andrew Cencici'] output is Andrew, input as ['Jan Kotas'] output is Jan, input as ['Mariya Sergienko'] output is Mariya, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
