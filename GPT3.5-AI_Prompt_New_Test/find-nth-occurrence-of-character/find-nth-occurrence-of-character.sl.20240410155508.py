Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Input Column Summary:
The input column data consists of phrases indicating replies to different individuals. Each phrase includes the names of three individuals: _aya, _tasisuke, and _chan.

Output Column Summary:
The output column data consists of numerical values that seem to be calculated based on the input phrases. The values are 12, 18, and 33 for the respective inputs.

Relationship between Input and Output:
Based on the provided examples, it appears that the output values are derived from the input phrases in some way. The relationship between the input and output values is not immediately clear from the given examples. Further analysis or additional examples may be needed to determine the exact relationship between the input phrases and the output values., and input as ['replies to _aya, _tasisuke, and _chan', '1'] output is 12, input as ['replies to _aya, _tasisuke, and _chan', '2'] output is 18, input as ['replies to _aya, _tasisuke, and _chan', '3'] output is 33, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
