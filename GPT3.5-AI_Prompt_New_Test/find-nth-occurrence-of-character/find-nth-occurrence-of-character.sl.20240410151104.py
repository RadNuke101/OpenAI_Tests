Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Input Summary:
- The input data consists of a list of replies to different individuals, specifically _aya, _tasisuke, and _chan. The number of replies varies between 1, 2, and 3.

Output Summary:
- The output values are 12, 18, and 33.

Relationship between Input and Output:
- It appears that there is a pattern between the number of replies to the individuals (_aya, _tasisuke, and _chan) and the corresponding output values. The output values seem to increase as the number of replies increases. For example, when there is 1 reply, the output is 12. When there are 2 replies, the output is 18. And when there are 3 replies, the output is 33. This suggests that there is a positive correlation between the number of replies and the output values., and input as ['replies to _aya, _tasisuke, and _chan', '1'] output is 12, input as ['replies to _aya, _tasisuke, and _chan', '2'] output is 18, input as ['replies to _aya, _tasisuke, and _chan', '3'] output is 33, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
