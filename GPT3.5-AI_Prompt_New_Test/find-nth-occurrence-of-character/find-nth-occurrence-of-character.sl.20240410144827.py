Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Input Column Summary:
- The input column consists of qualitative data describing replies to different individuals, specifically _aya, _tasisuke, and _chan.

Output Column Summary:
- The output column consists of numerical data representing different values based on the input.

Relationship Summary:
- The relationship between the input and output columns seems to be based on the number of individuals mentioned in the input. The output values increase as the number of individuals mentioned in the input increases. This suggests that there is a direct relationship between the number of individuals mentioned in the input and the corresponding output values., and input as ['replies to _aya, _tasisuke, and _chan', '1'] output is 12, input as ['replies to _aya, _tasisuke, and _chan', '2'] output is 18, input as ['replies to _aya, _tasisuke, and _chan', '3'] output is 33, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.

# Define the generated function
def generated_function(input_str, output_str):
    # Split the input string into individual elements
    input_list = input_str.split(", ")
    
    # Extract the number of individuals mentioned in the input
    num_individuals = len(input_list[0].split(", "))
    
    # Convert the output string to an integer
    output_value = int(output_str)
    
    # Calculate the output based on the number of individuals mentioned
    if num_individuals == 1:
        return output_value + 6
    elif num_individuals == 2:
        return output_value + 12
    elif num_individuals == 3:
        return output_value + 21

# Test cases

generated_function('replies to _aya, _tasisuke, and _chan, 2', '18')
generated_function('replies to _aya, _tasisuke, and _chan, 3', '33')
print(generated_function("replies to _aya, _tasisuke, and _chan", "1"))  ## Output: 12
print(generated_function("replies to _aya, _tasisuke, and _chan", "2"))  ## Output: 18
print(generated_function("replies to _aya, _tasisuke, and _chan", "3"))  ## Output: 33
