Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Summary for Input Column Data:
- The input column data consists of different motorcycle brands followed by their engine sizes.
- The motorcycle brands included in the input data are Ducati and Honda.
- The engine sizes mentioned in the input data are 100, 125, 250, and 550.

Summary for Output Column Data:
- The output column data consists of the motorcycle brands Ducati and Honda.

Relationship between Input and Output:
- The output column (brand) is directly related to the first part of the input data, which is the motorcycle brand.
- The engine size mentioned in the input data does not affect the output brand.
- The output brand is determined solely based on the first part of the input data, which is the motorcycle brand (Ducati or Honda)., and input as ['Ducati100'] output is Ducati, input as ['Honda125'] output is Honda, input as ['Ducati250'] output is Ducati, input as ['Honda250'] output is Honda, input as ['Honda550'] output is Honda, input as ['Ducati125'] output is Ducati, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.

# Define the generated function
def generated_function(input_str):
    # Split the input string into brand and engine size
    brand, engine_size = input_str[:-3], int(input_str[-3:])
    
    # Check the brand and return the output accordingly
    if brand == 'Ducati':
        return 'Ducati'
    elif brand == 'Honda':
        return 'Honda'

# Test cases

print(generated_function('Honda125'))
print(generated_function('Ducati250'))
print(generated_function('Honda250'))
print(generated_function('Honda550'))
print(generated_function('Ducati125'))
print(generated_function("Ducati100"))  ## Output: Ducati
