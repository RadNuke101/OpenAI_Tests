Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Summary for Input Column Data:
- The input column data consists of different motorcycle brands followed by their engine sizes (e.g., Ducati100, Honda125).
- The brands mentioned in the input data are Ducati and Honda.

Summary for Output Column Data:
- The output column data consists of the brand names extracted from the input data (e.g., Ducati, Honda).
- The output column represents the brand of the motorcycle mentioned in the input data.

Relationship between Input and Output:
- The relationship between the input and output data is that the output column extracts and displays only the brand name from the input data.
- The output column serves as a simplified version of the input data, focusing solely on the brand of the motorcycle mentioned.
- The output column helps in categorizing the input data based on the brand of the motorcycle, making it easier to analyze and interpret the information., and input as ['Ducati100'] output is Ducati, input as ['Honda125'] output is Honda, input as ['Ducati250'] output is Ducati, input as ['Honda250'] output is Honda, input as ['Honda550'] output is Honda, input as ['Ducati125'] output is Ducati, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
