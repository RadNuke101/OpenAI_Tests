Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Summary for Input Column Data:
- The input column data consists of different motorcycle brands followed by their engine sizes.
- The brands mentioned in the input data are Ducati and Honda.
- The engine sizes mentioned in the input data are 100, 125, 250, and 550.

Summary for Output Column Data:
- The output column data consists of the brand names only, either Ducati or Honda.

Relationship between Input and Output:
- The output column (brand name) is derived from the input column data by extracting the brand name mentioned before the engine size.
- The output column reflects the brand of the motorcycle mentioned in the input data.
- The relationship between the input and output is that the output is determined by the brand name mentioned in the input data, specifically the brand name that comes before the engine size., and input as ['Ducati100'] output is Ducati, input as ['Honda125'] output is Honda, input as ['Ducati250'] output is Ducati, input as ['Honda250'] output is Honda, input as ['Honda550'] output is Honda, input as ['Ducati125'] output is Ducati, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.

    # Iterate through each input argument
    for arg in args:
        # Split the input argument into brand and engine size
        brand, engine_size = arg[:-3], arg[-3:]
        
        # Append the brand to the output list
        output.append(brand)
    
    # Return the output list
    return output
