Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Summary for Input Column Data:
- The input column data consists of phrases or sentences that are focused on different aspects such as time, evil, and life.

Summary for Output Column:
- The output column consists of words that are related to deeper or negative aspects such as evil.

Relationship between Input and Output:
- The input column data seems to be exploring different concepts or ideas, while the output column focuses on more negative or profound aspects. The relationship between the input and output could be that the input is prompting a deeper exploration or reflection on certain topics, leading to the output of words related to deeper or negative aspects., and input as ['focus on one thing at a time'] output is time, input as ['premature opt is the root of all evil'] output is evil, input as ['where is life'] output is life, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
