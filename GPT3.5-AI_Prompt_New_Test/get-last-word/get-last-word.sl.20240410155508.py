Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Summary for input column data:
- The input column data consists of phrases related to focus, options, and life.

Summary for output column data:
- The output column data consists of words related to time, evil, and life.

Relationship between input and output:
- The input column data seems to revolve around different aspects of life and decision-making, while the output column data reflects the key themes or outcomes associated with those aspects. The relationship between the input and output can be seen as a progression from focusing on one thing at a time to dealing with the consequences of premature decisions, ultimately leading to a reflection on the essence of life itself., and input as ['focus on one thing at a time'] output is time, input as ['premature opt is the root of all evil'] output is evil, input as ['where is life'] output is life, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
