Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Input Summary:
The input data consists of phrases or sentences that seem to be focused on different topics or themes such as time management, the concept of evil, and the meaning of life.

Output Summary:
The output data consists of single words that are key elements or themes extracted from the input data, specifically "time", "evil", and "life".

Relationship Summary:
The relationship between the input and output data appears to involve extracting key concepts or themes from the input phrases. The output words seem to represent central ideas or focal points within the input data, highlighting the importance of these concepts in the context of the input sentences. This process of summarization helps to distill the essence of the input phrases into key themes, providing a concise representation of the main ideas conveyed in the original data., and input as ['focus on one thing at a time'] output is time, input as ['premature opt is the root of all evil'] output is evil, input as ['where is life'] output is life, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
