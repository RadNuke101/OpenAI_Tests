1. Valentine day: A special day celebrated in 1915 with a rating of 7.1 and 45 votes.
2. Movie blah=2blahblah, The: A movie released in 1914 with a rating of 7.9 and 17 votes.

Output Column Summary:
- The output column includes the titles "Valentine day" and "Movie blah=2blahblah, The", which are related to special occasions or events.

Relationship between Input and Output:
The input data consists of specific events or movies with associated ratings and votes. The output column seems to be a combination of these events or movie titles, suggesting a connection between the input data and the output. The output may be a compilation of noteworthy or memorable occurrences, possibly highlighting significant moments or popular choices., and input as ['valentine day=1915=50==7.1=45'] output is valentine day, input as ['movie blah=2blahblah, The=1914=54==7.9=17'] output is movie blah=2blahblah, The, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
