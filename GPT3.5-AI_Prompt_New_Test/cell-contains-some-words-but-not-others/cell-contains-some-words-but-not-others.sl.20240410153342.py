Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Summary for Input Column Data:
1. ['red ball, green sweater', 'red', 'green', 'pink']: The input column data consists of color descriptions for items such as a red ball and a green sweater.
2. ['pink ball, green sweater', 'red', 'green', 'pink']: The input column data includes color descriptions for items like a pink ball and a green sweater.
3. ['blue sea, pink ribbon', 'red', 'blue', 'pink']: The input column data contains color descriptions for objects like a blue sea and a pink ribbon.
4. ['black sea, white ribbon', 'red', 'blue', 'pink']: The input column data features color descriptions for items such as a black sea and a white ribbon.
5. ['red green blue', 'red', 'blue', 'pink']: The input column data includes color descriptions like red, green, and blue.

Summary for Output Column Data:
1. True: The output column data indicates a true relationship between the input color descriptions and the output. This suggests that the input contains at least one of the colors mentioned in the output.

Relationship Summary:
The output column data being true indicates that the input column data includes at least one of the colors mentioned in the output. This suggests that the presence of specific colors in the input determines the truth value of the output. The relationship between the input and output is based on the presence or absence of certain colors within the input data., and input as ['red ball, green sweater', 'red', 'green', 'pink'] output is true, input as ['pink ball, green sweater', 'red', 'green', 'pink'] output is false, input as ['blue sea, pink ribbon', 'red', 'blue', 'pink'] output is false, input as ['black sea, white ribbon', 'red', 'blue', 'pink'] output is false, input as ['red green blue', 'red', 'blue', 'pink'] output is true, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.

# Define the generated function
def generated_function(input_str, color1, color2, color3):
    # Check if any of the colors mentioned in the output are present in the input
    if color1 in input_str or color2 in input_str or color3 in input_str:
        return True
    else:
        return False

# Test cases
print(generated_function('red ball, green sweater', 'red', 'green', 'pink')) # Should return True

print(generated_function('blue sea, pink ribbon', 'red', 'blue', 'pink')) # Should return False
print(generated_function('black sea, white ribbon', 'red', 'blue', 'pink')) # Should return False
print(generated_function('red green blue', 'red', 'blue', 'pink')) # Should return True
print(generated_function("red ball, green sweater", "red", "green", "pink"))  ## Output: true
