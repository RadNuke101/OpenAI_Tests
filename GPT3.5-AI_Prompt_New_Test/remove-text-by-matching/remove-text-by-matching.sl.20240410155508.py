Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Summary for Input Column Data:
- The input column data consists of phone numbers in the format XXX-XXX-XXXX.
- Each entry in the input column represents a unique phone number.

Summary for Output Column Data:
- The output column data consists of phone numbers without any dashes.
- Each entry in the output column is a transformed version of the corresponding input phone number.

Relationship between Input and Output:
- The relationship between the input and output is a transformation of the phone numbers.
- The transformation involves removing the dashes from the input phone numbers to generate the output phone numbers.
- The output phone numbers are a direct result of the manipulation of the input phone numbers by removing the dashes., and input as ['801-345-1987'] output is 8013451987, input as ['612-554-2000'] output is 6125542000, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
