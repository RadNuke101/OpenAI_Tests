Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Summary for Input Column Data:
- The input column data consists of phone numbers in the format XXX-XXX-XXXX.

Summary for Output Column:
- The output column consists of phone numbers without any dashes.

Relationship between Input and Output:
- The relationship between the input and output is that the output column is derived from the input column by removing the dashes from the phone numbers. This transformation simplifies the phone numbers and makes them easier to read and use., and input as ['801-345-1987'] output is 8013451987, input as ['612-554-2000'] output is 6125542000, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.

# Define the generated function

    output = input_str.replace("-", "")
    
    # Return the output without dashes
    return output
