Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Input Column Data Summary:
- The input column data consists of phrases expressing feelings towards fruits, specifically apples and bananas.

Output Column Summary:
- The output column data consists of the phrase "I hate bananas" or "I love apples" based on the input provided.

Relationship Summary:
- The relationship between the input and output columns is that the output is determined by the presence of the word "banana" or "apple" in the input phrases. If the input contains "banana," the output will be "I hate bananas." If the input contains "apple," the output will be "I love apples." This relationship shows a direct connection between the input data and the resulting output, indicating a simple classification based on the presence of specific keywords., and input as ['I love apples', 'I hate bananas', 'banana'] output is I hate bananas, input as ['I love apples', 'I hate bananas', 'apple'] output is I love apples, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
