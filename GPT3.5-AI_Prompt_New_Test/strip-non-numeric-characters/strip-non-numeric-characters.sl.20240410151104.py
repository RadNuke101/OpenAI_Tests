Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Summary for Input Column Data:
- The input column data consists of qualitative descriptions with numerical values embedded within them. The descriptions vary in terms of context, such as mentioning apples, prices, and serial numbers.

Summary for Output Column Data:
- The output column data consists of numerical values extracted from the input column data. These values represent quantities related to apples, prices, or serial numbers.

Relationship between Input and Output:
- The input column data provides context or information related to apples, prices, or serial numbers, while the output column data extracts and presents the numerical values associated with these elements. The relationship between the input and output is that the output column data captures and isolates the numerical values mentioned in the input column data, providing a clear representation of the quantities specified., and input as ['100 apples'] output is 100, input as ['the price is %500 dollars'] output is 500, input as ['serial number %003399'] output is 003399, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.

# Define the generated function
def generated_function(input_str):

    if 'apples' in input_str:

    elif 'price' in input_str:
        # Extract the numerical value related to price
        output = int(''.join(filter(str.isdigit, input_str)))
    # Check if the input contains the words 'serial number'
    elif 'serial number' in input_str:
        # Extract the numerical value related to the serial number
        output = ''.join(filter(str.isdigit, input_str))
    
    return output

# Test cases
input1 = '100 apples'
input2 = 'the price is $500 dollars'
input3 = 'serial number #003399'

# Call the generated function with the test cases
output1 = generated_function(input1)
output2 = generated_function(input2)
