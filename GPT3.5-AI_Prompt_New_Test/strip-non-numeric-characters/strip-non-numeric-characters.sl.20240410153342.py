Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Summary for Input Column Data:
- The input column data consists of qualitative descriptions such as "100 apples", "the price is %500 dollars", and "serial number %003399".

Summary for Output Column Data:
- The output column data consists of numerical values extracted from the input column data, such as 100, 500, and 003399.

Relationship between Input and Output:
- The input column data contains qualitative descriptions that include numerical values embedded within them. The output column data extracts and presents these numerical values in a standalone format. The relationship between the input and output is that the output column isolates and displays the numerical information provided in the input column data., and input as ['100 apples'] output is 100, input as ['the price is %500 dollars'] output is 500, input as ['serial number %003399'] output is 003399, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
