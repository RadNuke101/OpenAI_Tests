Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Summary for Input Column Data:

- The input column data consists of the word "spreadsheet" split into individual characters.
- Each character in the input column data represents a specific position in the word "spreadsheet".

Summary for Output Column Data:

- The output column data consists of the characters 's', 'p', 'r', 'e', 'a' corresponding to the positions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 in the word "spreadsheet".
- The output column data represents the characters at the specified positions in the word "spreadsheet".

Relationship between Input and Output:

- The relationship between the input and output is that the output column data represents the characters at the positions specified in the input column data.
- For example, when the input is 'spreadsheet' and '1', the output is 's', which is the character at position 1 in the word "spreadsheet".
- This relationship allows for easy retrieval of specific characters from the word "spreadsheet" based on the input provided., and input as ['spreadsheet', '1'] output is s, input as ['spreadsheet', '2'] output is p, input as ['spreadsheet', '3'] output is r, input as ['spreadsheet', '4'] output is e, input as ['spreadsheet', '5'] output is a, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
