'''
Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Summary for Input Column Data:

- The input column data consists of the word "spreadsheet" split into individual characters.
- Each character in the input column data represents a different position in the word "spreadsheet".

Summary for Output Column Data:

- The output column data consists of individual characters extracted from the input word "spreadsheet" based on the numerical input provided.
- Each output character corresponds to a specific position in the input word "spreadsheet" based on the numerical input.

Relationship between Input and Output:

- The relationship between the input column data and the output column data is that the numerical input determines which character from the input word "spreadsheet" is extracted and displayed as the output.
- The output character is directly related to the position of the character in the input word "spreadsheet" based on the numerical input provided.
- The output column data serves as a way to extract specific characters from the input word "spreadsheet" based on the numerical input, showcasing a direct relationship between the input and output., and input as ['spreadsheet', '1'] output is s, input as ['spreadsheet', '2'] output is p, input as ['spreadsheet', '3'] output is r, input as ['spreadsheet', '4'] output is e, input as ['spreadsheet', '5'] output is a, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
