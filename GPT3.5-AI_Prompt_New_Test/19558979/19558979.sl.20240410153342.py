Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: For the input column data, the summary for each input column is as follows:

1. The input column data ['spreadsheet', '1'] has the letter 's'.
2. The input column data ['spreadsheet', '2'] has the letter 'p'.
3. The input column data ['spreadsheet', '3'] has the letter 'r'.
4. The input column data ['spreadsheet', '4'] has the letter 'e'.
5. The input column data ['spreadsheet', '5'] has the letter 'a'.

For the output column data, the summary is as follows:

The output column data consists of the letters 's', 'p', 'r', 'e', 'a'. 

Relationship between input and output:
The output column data seems to be the first letter of each word in the input column data. This relationship suggests that the output is derived from the first letter of each word in the input., and input as ['spreadsheet', '1'] output is s, input as ['spreadsheet', '2'] output is p, input as ['spreadsheet', '3'] output is r, input as ['spreadsheet', '4'] output is e, input as ['spreadsheet', '5'] output is a, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
