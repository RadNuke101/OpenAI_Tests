Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Summary for Input Column Data:
- The input column data consists of strings representing different values.
- The values in the input column data are not necessarily unique.

Summary for Output Column:
- The output column consists of boolean values (true or false) based on the relationship between the input values.

Relationship between Input and Output:
- The output is determined by whether the second element in the input list is a substring of the first element.
- If the second element is a substring of the first element, the output is true; otherwise, it is false.
- The relationship between the input and output is based on the presence of a specific string within another string., and input as ['ABC', 'D'] output is false, input as ['ABC', 'BC'] output is true, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
