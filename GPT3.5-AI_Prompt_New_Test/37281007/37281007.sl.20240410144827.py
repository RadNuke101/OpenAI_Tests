Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Summary for Input Column Data:
- The input column data consists of strings representing different values.
- Each value in the input column data is unique and does not repeat within the column.

Summary for Output Column Data:
- The output column data consists of boolean values (true or false) based on the relationship between the input values.

Relationship between Input and Output:
- The output is determined by whether the second value in the input list is a substring of the first value.
- If the second value is a substring of the first value, the output is true; otherwise, it is false.
- The relationship between input and output is based on the presence of a specific pattern (substring) within the input values., and input as ['ABC', 'D'] output is false, input as ['ABC', 'BC'] output is true, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
