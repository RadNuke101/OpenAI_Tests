Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Summary for Input Column 1: The input column contains two strings 'ABC' and 'BC'. Both strings are related in that 'BC' is a subset of 'ABC'.

Summary for Input Column 2: The input column contains two strings 'D' and 'BC'. There is no direct relationship between these two strings.

Summary for Output Column: The output column contains two boolean values, false and true. The output value is true when the second string in the input column is a subset of the first string, and false otherwise.

Relationship between Input and Output: The output value is determined by whether the second string in the input column is a subset of the first string. If the second string is a subset, the output is true; otherwise, it is false. This relationship suggests that the output is based on the presence of one string within another in the input column., and input as ['ABC', 'D'] output is false, input as ['ABC', 'BC'] output is true, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
