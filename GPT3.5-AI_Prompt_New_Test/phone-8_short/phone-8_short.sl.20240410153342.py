Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: For the input columns, it seems that each entry consists of a country code followed by a phone number formatted with spaces and dashes. The country code varies in length, and the phone number portion consists of three sets of numbers separated by dashes. The input data appears to be consistent in structure across all entries.

As for the output column, it represents the last set of numbers in the phone number portion of each entry. This set seems to be the final segment of the phone number and is always separated by the last dash in the input data.

The relationship between the input and output columns is that the output column consistently represents the last set of numbers in the phone number portion of each entry in the input column. This suggests that the output column is derived from the input column by extracting the final set of numbers after the last dash in each entry., and input as ['+106 769-858-438'] output is 438, input as ['+83 973-757-831'] output is 831, input as ['+62 647-787-775'] output is 775, input as ['+172 027-507-632'] output is 632, input as ['+72 001-050-856'] output is 856, input as ['+95 310-537-401'] output is 401, input as ['+6 775-969-238'] output is 238, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
