Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Summary for Input Column Data:
- The input column data consists of country names such as India, China, Japan, Indonesia, and Korea.
- The countries mentioned in the input column data are all located in Asia.

Summary for Output Column Data:
- The output column data consists of country names that are part of the input column data.
- The output column data includes countries such as India, China, and Indonesia.

Relationship between Input and Output:
- The output column data includes countries that are part of the input column data.
- The output column data seems to be a subset of the input column data, containing specific countries mentioned in the input., and input as ['india china japan'] output is india china, input as ['indonesia korea'] output is indonesia, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
