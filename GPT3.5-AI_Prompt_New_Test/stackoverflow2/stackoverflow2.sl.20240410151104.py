Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Input Column Summary:
The input column data consists of countries - India, China, Japan, Indonesia, and Korea.

Output Column Summary:
The output column data consists of countries - India, China, and Indonesia.

Relationship Summary:
The output column includes countries that are present in the input column data. Specifically, the output column includes India and China, which are part of the input data 'India China Japan'. Additionally, Indonesia is included in the output column, which is part of the input data 'Indonesia Korea'. Therefore, the relationship between the input and output columns is that the output column includes countries that are mentioned in the input column data., and input as ['india china japan'] output is india china, input as ['indonesia korea'] output is indonesia, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.

# Define the generated function
def generated_function(*args):
    output = []
    for arg in args:
        if 'india' in arg:
            output.append('india')
        if 'china' in arg:
            output.append('china')
        if 'indonesia' in arg:
            output.append('indonesia')
    return output

# Test cases
print(generated_function('india china japan'))  # Output: ['india', 'china']
print(generated_function('indonesia korea'))    # Output: ['indonesia']
print(generated_function("india china japan"))  ## Output: india china
print(generated_function("indonesia korea"))  ## Output: indonesia
