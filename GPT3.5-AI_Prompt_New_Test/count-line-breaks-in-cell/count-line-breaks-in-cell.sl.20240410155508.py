Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Summary for Input Column Data:
- The input column data consists of strings representing different categories or levels. Each string represents a distinct category or level within the input data.

Summary for Output Column Data:
- The output column data consists of numerical values representing the length of the strings in the input column data. The values in the output column indicate the number of levels or categories present in each string in the input data.

Relationship between Input and Output:
- The relationship between the input and output is that the numerical value in the output column corresponds to the number of distinct categories or levels present in each string in the input column data. The output column provides a quantitative representation of the qualitative data in the input column, indicating the complexity or depth of the categories or levels within each string., and input as ['one'] output is 1, input as ['one/ntwo'] output is 2, input as ['one/ntwo/nthree'] output is 3, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
