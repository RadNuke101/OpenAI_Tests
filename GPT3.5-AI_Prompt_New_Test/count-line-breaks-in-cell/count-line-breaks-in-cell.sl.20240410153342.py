Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: For the input column data:

- The input column data consists of strings that are separated by slashes ("/").
- Each string represents a different level of hierarchy or category.
- The number of levels in the input column data corresponds to the number of elements in each input list.
- The input column data can be seen as a hierarchical structure with multiple levels.

For the output column data:

- The output column data consists of numerical values that represent the number of elements in each input list.
- The output column data indicates the depth or level of hierarchy present in the input column data.
- The output column data provides a quantitative measure of the complexity of the input column data.

Relationship between input and output:

- The relationship between the input and output columns is that the number of levels in the input data directly corresponds to the numerical value in the output column.
- As the number of levels in the input data increases, the numerical value in the output column also increases.
- The output column serves as a summary measure of the complexity or depth of the input column data.
- The output column provides a way to quantify the hierarchical structure present in the input column data.

Overall, the input column data can be interpreted as a hierarchical structure with multiple levels, and the output column data provides a quantitative measure of the complexity of this hierarchy. The relationship between the input and output columns highlights how the depth of the hierarchy in the input data is reflected in the numerical values in the output column., and input as ['one'] output is 1, input as ['one/ntwo'] output is 2, input as ['one/ntwo/nthree'] output is 3, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
