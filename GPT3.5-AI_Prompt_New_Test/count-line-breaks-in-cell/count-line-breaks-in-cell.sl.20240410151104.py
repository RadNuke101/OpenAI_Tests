Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: For the input column data:

- The input column data consists of qualitative values representing different categories or labels.
- Each value in the input column data corresponds to a specific category or label.
- The input column data does not follow a specific pattern or order, as it is qualitative in nature.
- The input column data may contain multiple levels of categories separated by slashes (/).

For the output column data:

- The output column data consists of numerical values representing the length or count of categories in the input column data.
- The output values increase with the number of levels in the input column data.
- The relationship between the input and output columns is such that the output value corresponds to the number of levels or categories present in each input value.
- The output column serves as a quantitative representation of the qualitative input column data, providing a measure of the complexity or depth of the categories present.

Overall Relationship:

- The relationship between the input and output columns is that the output value is determined by the number of levels or categories present in each input value.
- The output column serves as a summary measure of the complexity or depth of the input column data.
- As the input column data becomes more detailed or contains more levels of categories, the output value increases accordingly.
- The output column provides a quantitative representation of the qualitative input column data, allowing for easier comparison and analysis of the data., and input as ['one'] output is 1, input as ['one/ntwo'] output is 2, input as ['one/ntwo/nthree'] output is 3, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
