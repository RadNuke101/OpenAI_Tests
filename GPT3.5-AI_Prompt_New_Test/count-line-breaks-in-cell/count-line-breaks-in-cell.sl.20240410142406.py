Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: For the input column data, the summary for each column is as follows:

1. Input Column 1: 
   - Unique values: ['one', 'two', 'three']
   - Number of unique values: 3
   - Summary: The input column contains three unique qualitative values - 'one', 'two', and 'three'.

For the output column data:
- Output Column:
  - Unique values: [1, 2, 3]
  - Number of unique values: 3
  - Summary: The output column corresponds to the number of elements in the input data. The values range from 1 to 3, indicating the count of elements in the input.

Relationship between input and output:
- The output value corresponds to the number of elements present in the input data. Each additional element in the input data results in an increment of 1 in the output value. This relationship is consistent across all input data entries., and input as ['one'] output is 1, input as ['one/ntwo'] output is 2, input as ['one/ntwo/nthree'] output is 3, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.

# Define the generated function
def generated_function(*args):
    # Initialize the output value
    output = 0
    
    # Loop through each input argument
    for arg in args:
        # Split the input argument by '/' to count the number of elements
        elements = arg.split('/')
        # Increment the output value by the number of elements
        output += len(elements)
    
    # Return the final output value
    return output

# Test cases with the provided input data
print(generated_function('one'))  # Output: 1
print(generated_function('one/two'))  # Output: 2
print(generated_function('one/two/three'))  # Output: 3
