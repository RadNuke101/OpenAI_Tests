Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Input Column Summary:
The input column data consists of phrases related to the nursery rhyme "Humpty Dumpty." Each phrase is a sentence or a fragment related to the character or events in the rhyme.

Output Column Summary:
The output column data consists of numbers that represent the word count of each input phrase. The numbers range from 2 to 6, indicating the length of each input phrase in terms of the number of words.

Relationship Summary:
The relationship between the input and output columns is that the output column provides a quantitative measure (word count) of the qualitative input data (phrases related to "Humpty Dumpty"). The output numbers reflect the length or complexity of each input phrase, with longer phrases having higher word counts. This relationship allows for a simple and objective way to measure and compare the length of different phrases in the context of the nursery rhyme., and input as ['humpty dumpty'] output is 2, input as ['humpty dumpty sat on a wall,'] output is 6, input as ['couldnt put humpty together again.'] output is 5, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
