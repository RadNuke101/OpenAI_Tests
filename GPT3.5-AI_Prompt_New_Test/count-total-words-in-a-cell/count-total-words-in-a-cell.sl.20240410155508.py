Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Summary for Input Column Data:
- The input column data consists of phrases related to the nursery rhyme "Humpty Dumpty."
- Each input is a complete sentence or phrase related to the nursery rhyme.

Summary for Output Column:
- The output column consists of numbers ranging from 2 to 6.
- The numbers seem to represent the length of the words in the corresponding input phrases.

Relationship between Input and Output:
- The output number corresponds to the number of words in the input phrase.
- The length of the input phrase seems to determine the output number.
- Longer input phrases result in higher output numbers, indicating a relationship between input length and output length., and input as ['humpty dumpty'] output is 2, input as ['humpty dumpty sat on a wall,'] output is 6, input as ['couldnt put humpty together again.'] output is 5, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.

    output = []
    for arg in args:
        words = arg.split()
        output.append(len(words))
    return output

# Test cases
print(generated_function('humpty dumpty'))  # Output: [2]
print(generated_function('humpty dumpty sat on a wall,'))  # Output: [6]
print(generated_function('couldnt put humpty together again.'))  # Output: [5]
print(generated_function("humpty dumpty"))  ## Output: 2
print(generated_function("humpty dumpty sat on a wall,"))  ## Output: 6
print(generated_function("couldnt put humpty together again."))  ## Output: 5
