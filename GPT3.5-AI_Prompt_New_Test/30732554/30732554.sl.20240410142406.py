Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Summary for Input Column Data:
- The input column data consists of various codes in the format of 'XX-XXXXXX' or 'XX-XXXXXX| XXMM' where X represents alphanumeric characters. There are also entries with 'N/A'.

Summary for Output Column Data:
- The output column data consists of the extracted codes from the input column data. It includes the codes in the format of 'XX-XXXXXX' without any additional information.

Relationship between Input and Output:
- The output column is derived from the input column by extracting the code portion before any additional information such as '| XXMM'. The relationship between the input and output is that the output is a subset of the input, specifically the code part of the input. This extraction process helps in simplifying and standardizing the data for further analysis or processing., and input as ['TL-18273982| 10MM'] output is TL-18273982, input as ['TL-288762| 76DK'] output is TL-288762, input as ['CT-576'] output is CT-576, input as ['N/A'] output is N/A, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
