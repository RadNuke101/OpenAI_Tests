Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Summary for Input Column Data:
- The input column data consists of various codes and labels such as TL-18273982, 10MM, TL-288762, 76DK, CT-576, and N/A.

Summary for Output Column Data:
- The output column data consists of the extracted codes from the input column data, such as TL-18273982, TL-288762, CT-576, and N/A.

Relationship between Input and Output:
- The output column data seems to be derived from the input column data by extracting specific codes or labels. The output column contains the codes extracted from the input column, which are typically alphanumeric characters followed by numbers or letters. The relationship between the input and output columns is that the output column represents a simplified version of the input column, focusing only on the codes present in the input data., and input as ['TL-18273982| 10MM'] output is TL-18273982, input as ['TL-288762| 76DK'] output is TL-288762, input as ['CT-576'] output is CT-576, input as ['N/A'] output is N/A, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
