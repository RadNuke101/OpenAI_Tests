Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Summary for Input Column Data:
- The input column data consists of various codes with different formats such as TL-18273982, TL-288762, CT-576, and N/A.

Summary for Output Column Data:
- The output column data consists of the extracted codes from the input column data, which include TL-18273982, TL-288762, CT-576, and N/A.

Relationship between Input and Output:
- The output column data is derived from the input column data by extracting the codes present in each input. The relationship between the input and output is that the output represents a subset of the input data, specifically the codes present in each input. The output serves as a simplified version of the input, focusing only on the relevant codes., and input as ['TL-18273982| 10MM'] output is TL-18273982, input as ['TL-288762| 76DK'] output is TL-288762, input as ['CT-576'] output is CT-576, input as ['N/A'] output is N/A, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.

# Define the generated function
def generated_function(input_str):
    # Split the input string to extract the code
    code = input_str.split('|')[0]
    
    # Return the extracted code
    return code

# Test cases
