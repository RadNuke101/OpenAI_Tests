Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: For the input columns, the most common values are as follows:
1. First column: 0, 5
2. Second column: 0, 6
3. Third column: 0, 4
4. Fourth column: 0, 6
5. Fifth column: 0, 4
6. Sixth column: 0, 7

For the output column, the most common values are 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

Based on the provided input and output data, it appears that the output value is often influenced by the presence of the number 0 in the input columns. The output tends to be higher when there are fewer occurrences of 0 in the input columns. Additionally, the output value can vary based on the specific combination of input values, with no clear pattern emerging from the provided data., and input as ['7 0 0 5 4 4'] output is 3, input as ['0 0 2 3 3 0'] output is 3, input as ['5 6 4 6 0 7'] output is 4, input as ['0 4 5 0 0 2'] output is 2, input as ['3 0 3 0 1 2'] output is 2, input as ['5 3 2 5 6 1'] output is 6, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
