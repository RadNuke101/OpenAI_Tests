Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: For the input columns, each column represents a different qualitative category. The summary for each input column is as follows:

1. Column 1: ['7', '0', '0', '5', '4', '4']
   - Categories: 7, 0, 5, 4
   - Summary: The categories in this column are 7, 0, 5, and 4.

2. Column 2: ['0', '0', '2', '3', '3', '0']
   - Categories: 0, 2, 3
   - Summary: The categories in this column are 0, 2, and 3.

3. Column 3: ['5', '6', '4', '6', '0', '7']
   - Categories: 5, 6, 4, 0, 7
   - Summary: The categories in this column are 5, 6, 4, 0, and 7.

4. Column 4: ['0', '4', '5', '0', '0', '2']
   - Categories: 0, 4, 5, 2
   - Summary: The categories in this column are 0, 4, 5, and 2.

5. Column 5: ['3', '0', '3', '0', '1', '2']
   - Categories: 3, 0, 1, 2
   - Summary: The categories in this column are 3, 0, 1, and 2.

6. Column 6: ['5', '3', '2', '5', '6', '1']
   - Categories: 5, 3, 2, 6, 1
   - Summary: The categories in this column are 5, 3, 2, 6, and 1.

For the output column, the summary is as follows:

Output Column: [3, 3, 4, 2, 2, 6]
- Categories: 3, 4, 2, 6
- Summary: The categories in the output column are 3, 4, 2, and 6.

Relationship between input and output:
Based on the provided data, it appears that the output value is determined by the highest category value present in the input columns. For example, in the first input set, the highest category value is 7, which corresponds to an output of 3. Similarly, in the second input set, the highest category value is 3, resulting in an output of 3. This pattern is consistent across all input sets, indicating that the output value is determined by the highest category value present in the input columns., and input as ['7 0 0 5 4 4'] output is 3, input as ['0 0 2 3 3 0'] output is 3, input as ['5 6 4 6 0 7'] output is 4, input as ['0 4 5 0 0 2'] output is 2, input as ['3 0 3 0 1 2'] output is 2, input as ['5 3 2 5 6 1'] output is 6, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
