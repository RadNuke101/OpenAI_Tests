Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Summary for Input Column Data:
- The input column data consists of qualitative values represented as strings of numbers.
- The values in the input column data do not follow a specific pattern or sequence.
- Each value in the input column data is unique and does not have a direct relationship with other values in the column.

Summary for Output Column Data:
- The output column data consists of numerical values.
- The output values are the same as the corresponding input values but converted to numerical form.
- The output values directly correspond to the input values without any transformation or manipulation.

Relationship between Input and Output:
- The relationship between the input and output is a direct conversion of qualitative data to quantitative data.
- The output values are derived from the input values by converting them from strings to numerical values.
- There is a one-to-one correspondence between each input value and its corresponding output value.
- The input values serve as labels or identifiers that are transformed into numerical values in the output column., and input as ['101'] output is 101, input as ['1002'] output is 1002, input as ['743'] output is 743, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.

    return int(input_str)

# Test cases
print(generated_function('101'))  # Output: 101
