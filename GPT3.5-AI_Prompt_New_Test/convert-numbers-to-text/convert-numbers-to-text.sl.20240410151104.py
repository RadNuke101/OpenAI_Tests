Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Summary for Input Column Data:
- The input column data consists of qualitative values represented as strings.
- The values in the input column data are unique and do not follow a specific pattern.
- Each value in the input column data represents a distinct input.

Summary for Output Column Data:
- The output column data consists of numerical values.
- The output column data represents the result of converting the qualitative input values to numerical values.
- The output values directly correspond to the input values after conversion.

Relationship between Input and Output:
- The relationship between the input and output is a direct mapping where each unique qualitative input value is converted to a numerical output value.
- The input values are transformed into output values without any manipulation or calculation.
- The output values are a direct representation of the qualitative input values in numerical form., and input as ['101'] output is 101, input as ['1002'] output is 1002, input as ['743'] output is 743, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.

    return int(input_str)

# Test cases
print(generated_function('101'))  # Output: 101
