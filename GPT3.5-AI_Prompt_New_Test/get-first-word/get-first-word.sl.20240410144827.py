Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Summary for Input Column Data:
- The input column data consists of qualitative phrases or words such as "The quick brown fox," "quick brown fox," and "fox."

Summary for Output Column Data:
- The output column data consists of individual words extracted from the input column data, such as "The," "quick," and "fox."

Relationship between Input and Output:
- The relationship between the input and output column data is that the output column contains individual words that are extracted from the input column data. The output column serves as a breakdown or extraction of the qualitative phrases or words provided in the input column data., and input as ['The quick brown fox.'] output is The, input as ['quick brown fox.'] output is quick, input as ['fox'] output is , , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.

        words = arg.split()
        for word in words:
            output.append(word)
    return output
