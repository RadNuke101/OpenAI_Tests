Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Summary for Input Column Data:
- The input column data consists of qualitative phrases or words, such as "The quick brown fox," "quick brown fox," and "fox."

Summary for Output Column:
- The output column contains the first word from each input phrase or word, such as "The," "quick," and an empty space for the single word "fox."

Relationship between Input and Output:
- The output column appears to extract the first word from each input phrase or word. It seems to focus on the initial element of the input data, disregarding the rest of the content. This relationship suggests a pattern of selecting the beginning of each input as the output., and input as ['The quick brown fox.'] output is The, input as ['quick brown fox.'] output is quick, input as ['fox'] output is , , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
