Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Summary for Input Column Data:
- The input column data consists of colors: yellow, gray, black, blue, pink, orange, and turkey.
- The colors yellow, blue, pink, and orange are associated with a true output, while gray, black, and turkey are associated with a false output.

Summary for Output Column:
- The output column consists of boolean values: true and false.
- The colors yellow, blue, pink, and orange are associated with a true output, while gray, black, and turkey are associated with a false output.

Relationship between Input and Output:
- The colors yellow, blue, pink, and orange are consistently associated with a true output, while gray, black, and turkey are consistently associated with a false output.
- Based on the provided data, it seems that certain colors have a direct relationship with the output value, with specific colors being more likely to result in a true output compared to others., and input as ['yellow'] output is true, input as ['gray'] output is false, input as ['black'] output is false, input as ['blue'] output is true, input as ['pink'] output is true, input as ['orange'] output is true, input as ['turkey'] output is false, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
