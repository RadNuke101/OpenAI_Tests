Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Input Column Summary:
- The input column data consists of birth dates and locations in a specific format.
- The birth dates are in the format of day, month, and year.
- The locations are denoted by abbreviations such as "HRL" for Westerkerk HRL.

Output Column Summary:
- The output column data consists of locations only.
- The locations are in the format of the name of the place, such as "Westerkerk HRL."

Relationship Summary:
- The input column provides information about birth dates and locations.
- The output column extracts and displays only the location information from the input.
- The relationship between the input and output is that the output focuses solely on the location aspect of the input data, disregarding the birth date information., and input as ['geb. 14 oct 1956 Westerkerk HRL'] output is Westerkerk HRL, input as ['geb. 14 oct 1956 '] output is , input as ['geb. 15 feb 1987 Westerkerk HRL'] output is Westerkerk HRL, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
