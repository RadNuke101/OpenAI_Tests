Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Summary for input column data:
- The input column data consists of dates, times, phone numbers, and text (loren ipsum/loren).
- The dates are in the format Month Day, Year.
- The times are in the format Hour=Minute AM/PM.
- The phone numbers are in the format +91 followed by 10 digits.
- The text varies and includes the phrase "loren ipsum" or "loren".

Summary for output column data:
- The output column data consists of dates and times similar to the input column data.
- The output column data is derived from the input column data by extracting the date and time information.

Relationship between input and output:
- The output column data is a subset of the input column data, specifically extracting the date and time information.
- The input column data provides additional context such as phone numbers and text, but the output focuses solely on the date and time.
- The input column data serves as the source from which the output column data is derived, highlighting the relevant date and time details., and input as ['Dec 2, 2014, 11=23 PM - +91 90000 80000= loren ipsum'] output is Dec 2, 2014, 11=23 PM, input as ['Dec 2, 2014, 11=24 PM - +91 90000 80000= loren'] output is Dec 2, 2014, 11=24 PM, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
