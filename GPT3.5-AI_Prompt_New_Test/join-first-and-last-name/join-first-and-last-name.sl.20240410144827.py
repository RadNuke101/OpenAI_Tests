Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Input Column 1 Summary: The names in this column are 'susan' and 'aaron'. Both names are of individuals.

Input Column 2 Summary: The surnames in this column are 'chang' and 'kim'. Both surnames are of Asian origin.

Output Column Summary: The output combines the first name from the input column with the surname from the second input column. The output pairs 'susan chang' and 'aaron kim' represent full names of individuals.

Relationship Summary: The output column combines the first name and surname from the input columns to create full names. The relationship between the input and output is that the output provides a complete name by combining the first name and surname from the input columns., and input as ['susan', 'chang'] output is susan chang, input as ['aaron', 'kim'] output is aaron kim, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.

    full_name = first_name + ' ' + surname
    return full_name

# Test cases
print(generated_function('susan', 'chang'))  # Output: susan chang
print(generated_function('aaron', 'kim'))  # Output: aaron kim
print(generated_function("susan", "chang"))  ## Output: susan chang
