Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Input Column 1 Summary:
The input column 1 consists of names such as 'susan' and 'aaron'. These names are common and do not appear to follow a specific pattern or theme.

Input Column 2 Summary:
The input column 2 consists of surnames such as 'chang' and 'kim'. Similar to column 1, these surnames do not seem to have a specific pattern or theme.

Output Column Summary:
The output column combines the first and last names from the input columns to form full names such as 'susan chang' and 'aaron kim'. The relationship between the input and output columns is that the full names are created by combining the first and last names from the input columns. The output column serves as a combination of the information provided in the input columns to generate a complete name for each entry., and input as ['susan', 'chang'] output is susan chang, input as ['aaron', 'kim'] output is aaron kim, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.

# Define the generated function
def generated_function(first_name, last_name):
    # Combine the first and last names to form a full name
    full_name = first_name + ' ' + last_name
    return full_name

# Test cases
print(generated_function('susan', 'chang'))  # Output: susan chang
print(generated_function('aaron', 'kim'))  # Output: aaron kim
print(generated_function("susan", "chang"))  ## Output: susan chang
