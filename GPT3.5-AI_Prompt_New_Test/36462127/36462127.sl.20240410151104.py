Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Summary for Input Column 1: 
The input data in column 1 consists of strings separated by slashes. The strings vary in length and content, with examples such as 'ABCDE', 'FGHI', 'JKL', and 'MNOPQR'.

Summary for Output Column:
The output column contains a single string from the input data, which is the last string after the last slash in each row. Examples include 'MNOPQR' and 'JKL'.

Relationship between Input and Output:
The output column is derived from the last string in each row of the input data. It appears that the output is always the last string after the last slash in the input data. This relationship suggests that the output is directly linked to the position of the string within the input data., and input as ['ABCDE/FGHI/JKL/MNOPQR'] output is MNOPQR, input as ['A/ABCDE/FGHI/JKL'] output is JKL, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.

# Define the generated function
def generated_function(input_str):
    # Split the input string by slashes and return the last element
    return input_str.split('/')[-1]

# Test cases
print(generated_function('ABCDE/FGHI/JKL/MNOPQR'))  # Output: MNOPQR
print(generated_function('A/ABCDE/FGHI/JKL'))  # Output: JKL
print(generated_function("ABCDE/FGHI/JKL/MNOPQR"))  ## Output: MNOPQR
print(generated_function("A/ABCDE/FGHI/JKL"))  ## Output: JKL
