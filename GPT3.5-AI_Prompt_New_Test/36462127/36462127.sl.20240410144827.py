Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Input Column 1 Summary:
- The input data in column 1 consists of strings separated by slashes.
- The strings in column 1 vary in length and content, with examples like 'ABCDE', 'FGHI', 'JKL', and 'MNOPQR'.

Output Column Summary:
- The output column consists of a single string extracted from the input data in column 1.
- The output string is always the last string in the input data, following the last slash.

Relationship between Input and Output:
- The output is always the last string in the input data, following the last slash.
- This relationship indicates that the output is dependent on the position of the string within the input data.
- The output is directly linked to the last element in the input data, suggesting a sequential relationship between the input strings., and input as ['ABCDE/FGHI/JKL/MNOPQR'] output is MNOPQR, input as ['A/ABCDE/FGHI/JKL'] output is JKL, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.

# Define the generated function
def generated_function(input_str):
    # Split the input string by slashes and extract the last element
    output = input_str.split('/')[-1]
    
    return output

# Test cases
print(generated_function('ABCDE/FGHI/JKL/MNOPQR'))  # Output: MNOPQR
print(generated_function('A/ABCDE/FGHI/JKL'))  # Output: JKL
print(generated_function("ABCDE/FGHI/JKL/MNOPQR"))  ## Output: MNOPQR
print(generated_function("A/ABCDE/FGHI/JKL"))  ## Output: JKL
