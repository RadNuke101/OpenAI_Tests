Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: For the input column data, the summary for the first input column ['ABCDE/FGHI/JKL/MNOPQR'] could be: 
- The data consists of strings representing different groups or categories, with each group separated by a forward slash. 
- The groups are arranged in a sequential order from left to right. 
- The data seems to follow a hierarchical structure, with each group possibly representing a subset of the previous group.

The summary for the second input column ['A/ABCDE/FGHI/JKL'] could be:
- Similar to the first input column, this data also consists of strings representing different groups or categories separated by forward slashes. 
- The groups are arranged in a sequential order from left to right. 
- The data may also follow a hierarchical structure, with each group possibly representing a subset of the previous group.

For the output column data, the summary for the output ['MNOPQR'] could be:
- The output consists of a single string representing a specific group or category. 
- The output seems to be the last group in the input data, possibly indicating a selection or extraction process.

Relationship between input and output:
- The output column seems to be derived from the input columns by selecting the last group in each input data. 
- The output column may represent the final or most specific category within the input data. 
- The input columns provide a hierarchical structure of categories, with the output column representing the final selection or result., and input as ['ABCDE/FGHI/JKL/MNOPQR'] output is MNOPQR, input as ['A/ABCDE/FGHI/JKL'] output is JKL, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.

# Define the generated function
def generated_function(input_str):
    # Split the input string by forward slashes to get the groups
    groups = input_str.split('/')
    # Return the last group as the output
    return groups[-1]

# Test cases
output1 = generated_function('ABCDE/FGHI/JKL/MNOPQR')
output2 = generated_function('A/ABCDE/FGHI/JKL')
print(generated_function("ABCDE/FGHI/JKL/MNOPQR"))  ## Output: MNOPQR
print(generated_function("A/ABCDE/FGHI/JKL"))  ## Output: JKL
