Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Input Column Data Summary:
- The input column data consists of the names of various universities or educational institutions along with their corresponding locations in the form of city, state, and country.

Output Column Data Summary:
- The output column data consists of the names of the universities or educational institutions along with their corresponding locations in the form of city, state, and country, followed by "USA" for each entry.

Relationship between Input and Output:
- The relationship between the input and output columns is that the output column appends "USA" to the end of each location entry provided in the input column. This indicates that all the universities or educational institutions listed are located within the United States of America. The output column serves to emphasize the country in which each institution is situated, providing a clear and consistent format for the location information., and input as ['University of Pennsylvania', 'Phialdelphia, PA, USA'] output is University of Pennsylvania, Phialdelphia, PA, USA, input as ['UCLA', 'Los Angeles, CA'] output is UCLA, Los Angeles, CA, USA, input as ['Cornell University', 'Ithaca, New York, USA'] output is Cornell University, Ithaca, New York, USA, input as ['Penn', 'Philadelphia, PA, USA'] output is Penn, Philadelphia, PA, USA, input as ['University of Maryland College Park', 'College Park, MD'] output is University of Maryland College Park, College Park, MD, USA, input as ['University of Michigan', 'Ann Arbor, MI, USA'] output is University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
