Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Summary for input column data:
- The input column data consists of the names of various universities along with their locations.
- The universities mentioned include University of Pennsylvania, UCLA, Cornell University, Penn, University of Maryland College Park, and University of Michigan.
- The locations mentioned include Philadelphia, PA, USA; Los Angeles, CA, USA; Ithaca, New York, USA; College Park, MD, USA; and Ann Arbor, MI, USA.

Summary for output column data:
- The output column data includes the names of the universities along with their respective locations and the country (USA).
- The output column data has been modified to include the country name (USA) along with the existing university names and locations.

Relationship between input and output:
- The input column data provides the names and locations of various universities.
- The output column data takes the input university names and locations and adds the country name (USA) to each entry.
- The relationship between the input and output is that the output enhances the input by providing a more complete description of each university's location, including the country., and input as ['University of Pennsylvania', 'Phialdelphia, PA, USA'] output is University of Pennsylvania, Phialdelphia, PA, USA, input as ['UCLA', 'Los Angeles, CA'] output is UCLA, Los Angeles, CA, USA, input as ['Cornell University', 'Ithaca, New York, USA'] output is Cornell University, Ithaca, New York, USA, input as ['Penn', 'Philadelphia, PA, USA'] output is Penn, Philadelphia, PA, USA, input as ['University of Maryland College Park', 'College Park, MD'] output is University of Maryland College Park, College Park, MD, USA, input as ['University of Michigan', 'Ann Arbor, MI, USA'] output is University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
