Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Summary for Input Column Data:
- The input column data consists of sentences describing different scenarios involving colors (yellow, green) and objects (dog).
- The sentences vary in complexity and detail, but all contain at least one of the specified colors and objects.

Summary for Output Column Data:
- The output column data consists of boolean values (true or false) indicating whether the input sentence meets certain criteria.
- The criteria involve the presence of specific colors (yellow, green) and objects (dog) in the input sentence.

Relationship between Input and Output:
- The output column data is determined based on whether the input sentence contains the specified colors (yellow, green) and objects (dog).
- If all specified colors and objects are present in the input sentence, the output is true. Otherwise, the output is false.
- The relationship between the input and output is based on the presence or absence of specific qualitative elements in the input data., and input as ['yellow dog on green grass', 'yellow', 'green', 'dog'] output is true, input as ['Lone dog with a green frisbie on yellow sand', 'yellow', 'green', 'dog'] output is true, input as ['A yellow sun in a green field', 'yellow', 'green', 'dog'] output is false, input as ['yellow neon sign with a green background', 'yellow', 'green', 'dog'] output is false, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
