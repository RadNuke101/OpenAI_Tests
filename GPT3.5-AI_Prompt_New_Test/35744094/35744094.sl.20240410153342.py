Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Summary for Input Column Data:
- The input column data consists of URLs related to technology companies and their products.
- Each input contains a specific company's website URL followed by a product or service name.

Summary for Output Column Data:
- The output column data consists of product or service names extracted from the input URLs.
- The output column includes names such as "mac," "windows," and "microsoft."

Relationship between Input and Output:
- The relationship between the input and output is that the output represents specific products or services associated with the technology companies mentioned in the input URLs.
- By analyzing the input URLs, we can extract and identify the product or service names, which are then reflected in the output column., and input as ['http=//www.apple.com/uk/mac'] output is mac, input as ['https=//www.microsoft.com/en-gb/windows'] output is windows, input as ['https=//www.microsoft.com/'] output is microsoft, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.

# Define the generated function
def generated_function(input_str):
    # Split the input string to extract the company and product names
    company, product = input_str.split('/')[-1].split('.')
    
    # Return the product name
    return product

# Test cases
print(generated_function('http=//www.apple.com/uk/mac'))  # Output: mac
print(generated_function('https=//www.microsoft.com/en-gb/windows'))  # Output: windows
print(generated_function('https=//www.microsoft.com/'))  # Output: microsoft
print(generated_function("http=//www.apple.com/uk/mac"))  ## Output: mac
print(generated_function("https=//www.microsoft.com/en-gb/windows"))  ## Output: windows
