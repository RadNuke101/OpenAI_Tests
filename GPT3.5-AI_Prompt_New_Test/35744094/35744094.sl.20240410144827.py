Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Summary for Input Column Data:
- The input column data consists of URLs related to technology companies and products such as Apple and Microsoft.

Summary for Output Column Data:
- The output column data consists of specific products or services related to the technology companies mentioned in the input URLs.

Relationship between Input and Output:
- The input URLs provide information about technology companies, while the output represents specific products or services offered by those companies. The relationship between the input and output is that the input URLs lead to the identification of the specific products or services associated with the companies mentioned., and input as ['http=//www.apple.com/uk/mac'] output is mac, input as ['https=//www.microsoft.com/en-gb/windows'] output is windows, input as ['https=//www.microsoft.com/'] output is microsoft, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
