Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Summary for Input Column Data:
- The input column data consists of qualitative information representing different quantities: 'one', 'two', 'three', 'four'.
- Each input value is associated with a number: '1', '2', '3', '4'.
- The input data represents different items: apple, banana, strawberry, orange.

Summary for Output Column Data:
- The output column data consists of qualitative information representing different fruits: apple, banana, strawberry, orange.
- Each fruit is associated with a specific quantity: 'one', 'two', 'three', 'four'.

Relationship between Input and Output:
- The input column data corresponds to the quantity of fruits in the output column.
- The input values determine the type and quantity of fruits produced as output.
- Each input value is directly linked to a specific fruit in the output column.
- The relationship between input and output is clear and consistent, with each input value resulting in a specific fruit output., and input as ['one, 1'] output is one apple, input as ['two, 2'] output is two bananas, input as ['three, 3'] output is three strawberries, input as ['four, 4'] output is four oranges, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.

# Define the generated function
def generated_function(input_str):
    # Create a dictionary mapping input values to output fruits
    mapping = {'one': 'apple', 'two': 'banana', 'three': 'strawberry', 'four': 'orange'}
    
    # Split the input string into input value and quantity
    input_value, quantity = input_str.split(', ')
    
    # Return the output fruit based on the input value and quantity
    return ' '.join([mapping[input_value]] * int(quantity)

# Test cases
print(generated_function('one, 1'))  # Output: apple
print(generated_function('two, 2'))  # Output: banana banana
print(generated_function('three, 3'))  # Output: strawberry strawberry strawberry
print(generated_function('four, 4'))  # Output: orange orange orange orange
print(generated_function("one, 1"))  ## Output: one apple
print(generated_function("two, 2"))  ## Output: two bananas
print(generated_function("three, 3"))  ## Output: three strawberries
print(generated_function("four, 4"))  ## Output: four oranges
