Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Summary for Input Column 1:
- The input column contains alphanumeric strings of varying lengths.
- Some strings contain special characters like '*', while others consist of only numbers and letters.
- There is a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters in the strings.

Summary for Input Column 2:
- The input column contains single-digit numbers ranging from 1 to 3.
- The numbers are represented as strings.

Summary for Output Column:
- The output column consists of alphanumeric strings similar to those in Input Column 1.
- The output strings do not include the number specified in Input Column 2.
- The output strings may contain special characters, numbers, and uppercase letters.

Relationship between Input and Output:
- The output string is derived from the input string in Input Column 1 by removing the character specified in Input Column 2.
- The character to be removed is the number represented in Input Column 2.
- The output string retains the same format and composition as the input string, excluding the specified character., and input as ['1234', '1'] output is 234, input as ['**512A', '2'] output is 512A, input as ['343DMX', '3'] output is DMX, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
