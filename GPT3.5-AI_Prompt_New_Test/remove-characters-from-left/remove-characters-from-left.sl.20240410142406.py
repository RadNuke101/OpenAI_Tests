Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Summary for Input Column 1:
- The input data in column 1 consists of alphanumeric strings with varying lengths and characters.
- The data includes numbers, letters, and special characters such as asterisks.

Summary for Input Column 2:
- The input data in column 2 consists of single-digit numbers.
- The numbers are used as identifiers or references for the corresponding strings in column 1.

Summary for Output Column:
- The output data consists of alphanumeric strings similar to those in input column 1.
- The output strings are derived from the input strings based on the single-digit numbers in input column 2.

Relationship between Input and Output:
- The output strings are extracted from the input strings based on the position indicated by the single-digit numbers in column 2.
- The relationship between input and output is that the output string is a subset of the corresponding input string, starting from the position indicated by the single-digit number.
- The output string retains the characters from the input string starting from the specified position until the end of the string., and input as ['1234', '1'] output is 234, input as ['**512A', '2'] output is 512A, input as ['343DMX', '3'] output is DMX, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
