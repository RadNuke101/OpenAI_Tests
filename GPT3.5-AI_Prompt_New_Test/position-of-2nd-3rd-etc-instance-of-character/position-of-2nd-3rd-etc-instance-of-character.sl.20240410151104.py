Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Summary for Input Column 1: The first input column contains strings that represent different objects or concepts. The values include '100x15x50' and 'cat-in-the-hat'.

Summary for Input Column 2: The second input column contains symbols, specifically the symbol 'x' and the symbol '-'.

Summary for Input Column 3: The third input column contains numerical values, specifically the numbers '2' and '3'.

Summary for Output Column: The output column contains numerical values, specifically '7' and '11'.

Relationship between Input and Output: The relationship between the input and output columns appears to involve some form of transformation or calculation. The specific nature of this relationship is not immediately clear based on the provided data. It seems that the input values are being processed in some way to produce the output values. Further analysis or additional information would be needed to determine the exact relationship between the input and output columns., and input as ['100x15x50', 'x', '2'] output is 7, input as ['cat-in-the-hat', '-', '3'] output is 11, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
