Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Summary for Input Column 1: The first input column contains strings that represent different types of data, such as dimensions ('100x15x50') and words ('cat-in-the-hat'). 

Summary for Input Column 2: The second input column contains a single character ('x' or '-'), which serves as a separator or operator between the elements in the first input column.

Summary for Input Column 3: The third input column contains numbers ('2'), which are used as factors or multipliers in the relationship between the elements in the first input column.

Summary for Output Column: The output column contains numbers that represent the result of a calculation based on the elements in the first input column and the factor in the third input column.

Relationship between Input and Output: The relationship between the input and output columns involves manipulating the elements in the first input column using the operator in the second input column and the factor in the third input column to produce the numerical output. The specific operation performed on the elements in the first input column is determined by the operator in the second input column, and the factor in the third input column influences the final output value., and input as ['100x15x50', 'x', '2'] output is 7, input as ['cat-in-the-hat', '-', '3'] output is 11, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
