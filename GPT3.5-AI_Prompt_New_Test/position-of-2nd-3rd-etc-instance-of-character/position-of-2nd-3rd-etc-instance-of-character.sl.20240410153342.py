Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Summary for Input Column 1: 
The first input column contains strings that represent different types of data, such as dimensions ('100x15x50') and words ('cat-in-the-hat'). 

Summary for Input Column 2: 
The second input column contains a single character ('x' or '-'), which is used as a separator in the strings in the first column. 

Summary for Input Column 3: 
The third input column contains numbers ('2' or '3'), which are used in some way with the data in the first column.

Summary for Output Column: 
The output column contains numbers ('7' or '11'), which seem to be the result of some operation performed on the data in the first column based on the separator in the second column and the number in the third column.

Relationship between Input and Output: 
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the output number is calculated based on the data in the first column, using the separator in the second column and the number in the third column. The specific operation or formula used to calculate the output number is not explicitly stated, but it likely involves some manipulation or transformation of the data in the first column., and input as ['100x15x50', 'x', '2'] output is 7, input as ['cat-in-the-hat', '-', '3'] output is 11, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
