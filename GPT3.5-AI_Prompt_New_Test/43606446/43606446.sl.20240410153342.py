Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: For the input columns, the data consists of currency pairs along with the type of transaction (IDEALPRO, CASH) and the currency being used in the transaction. The input data includes various currency pairs such as USD.EUR, KOR.JPN, and the corresponding transaction types and currencies involved.

Summary for input columns:
- Currency pairs include USD.EUR, KOR.JPN.
- Transaction types include IDEALPRO, CASH.
- Currencies involved in the transaction include EUR, USD, WON, YEN.

For the output column, the data consists of the currency used in the transaction. The output column includes currencies such as EUR, USD, WON, YEN.

Summary for output column:
- Currencies involved in the output include EUR, USD, WON, YEN.

Relationship between input and output:
The input data provides information about the currency pairs and transaction types involved in the transactions. The output column indicates the currency used in the transaction. By analyzing the input data, we can determine the relationship between the currency pairs, transaction types, and the currency used in the transaction. The output column is directly influenced by the input data, as it represents the currency that is being exchanged in the transaction based on the input currency pair and transaction type., and input as ['USD.EUR<IDEALPRO,CASH,EUR>'] output is EUR, input as ['USD.EUR<IDEALPRO,CASH,USD>'] output is USD, input as ['KOR.JPN<IDEALPRO,CASH,WON>'] output is WON, input as ['KOR.JPN<IDEALPRO,CASH,YEN>'] output is YEN, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.

# Define the generated function
def generated_function(input_str):
    # Split the input string into currency pair, transaction type, and currency
    input_list = input_str.split('<')
    currency_pair = input_list[0]
    transaction_type = input_list[1].split(',')[0]
    currency = input_list[1].split(',')[2][:-1]  # Remove the '>' at the end
    
    # Return the currency used in the transaction
    return currency

# Test cases
print(generated_function('USD.EUR<IDEALPRO,CASH,EUR>'))  # Output: EUR
