Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Summary for Input Column Data:
- In the first input column, the most common value is 'cat', appearing twice out of three total values.
- In the second input column, the most common value is 'red', appearing twice out of three total values.
- In the third input column, the most common value is 'soft', appearing twice out of three total values.

Summary for Output Column Data:
- The most common output value is 'soft', appearing twice out of three total values.

Relationship between Input and Output:
- Based on the provided data, it seems that the output value is often the same as the most common value in the input column. For example, when 'cat' is the most common input value, the output is 'cat'. Similarly, when 'red' is the most common input value, the output is 'red'. This suggests a pattern where the output value is influenced by the most common input value., and input as ['cat', 'dog', 'cat'] output is cat, input as ['blue', 'red', 'red'] output is red, input as ['firm', 'firm', 'soft'] output is firm, input as ['soft', 'soft', 'soft'] output is soft, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.

# Define the generated function
def generated_function(input_str):
    # Split the input string into individual elements
    input_list = input_str.split(', ')
    
    # Find the most common value in the input list
    most_common_value = max(set(input_list), key = input_list.count)
    
    # Return the most common value as the output
    return most_common_value

# Test cases
print(generated_function('cat, dog, cat'))  # Output: cat
print(generated_function('blue, red, red'))  # Output: red
print(generated_function('firm, firm, soft'))  # Output: firm
print(generated_function('soft, soft, soft'))  # Output: soft
