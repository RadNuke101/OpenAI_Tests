Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Summary for Input Column Data:
- In the first input column, the most frequently occurring value is 'cat'.
- In the second input column, the most frequently occurring value is 'red'.
- In the third input column, the most frequently occurring value is 'firm'.
- In the fourth input column, the most frequently occurring value is 'soft'.

Summary for Output Column Data:
- The most frequently occurring value in the output column is 'cat'.

Relationship between Input and Output:
- The output value seems to be determined by the most frequently occurring value in the input column. For example, when the most frequent input value is 'cat', the output is also 'cat'. Similarly, when the most frequent input value is 'red', the output is 'red'. This suggests a direct relationship between the input and output values based on the most common input value., and input as ['cat', 'dog', 'cat'] output is cat, input as ['blue', 'red', 'red'] output is red, input as ['firm', 'firm', 'soft'] output is firm, input as ['soft', 'soft', 'soft'] output is soft, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
