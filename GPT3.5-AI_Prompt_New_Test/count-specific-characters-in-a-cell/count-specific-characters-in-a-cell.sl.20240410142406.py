Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Summary for Input Column Data:
- The input column data consists of the name "Hannah" and a single letter.
- The letters in the input column data are 'n', 'x', 'N', 'a', and 'h'.
- The letter 'a' appears twice in the input column data, while 'n' and 'h' appear once each.

Summary for Output Column Data:
- The output column data consists of the numbers 2, 0, 0, 2, and 1.
- The output values range from 0 to 2.

Relationship between Input and Output:
- The output values seem to correspond to the number of times the letter in the input column data appears in the name "Hannah".
- For example, when the letter 'a' appears twice in "Hannah", the output is 2.
- When the letter 'n', 'x', or 'N' does not appear in "Hannah", the output is 0.
- This relationship suggests that the output values are based on the frequency of the input letter in the name "Hannah"., and input as ['Hannah', 'n'] output is 2, input as ['Hannah', 'x'] output is 0, input as ['Hannah', 'N'] output is 0, input as ['Hannah', 'a'] output is 2, input as ['Hannah', 'h'] output is 1, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.

# Define the generated function
def generated_function(name, letter):
    # Count the number of times the letter appears in the name
    count = name.count(letter)
    
    # Return the count as the output
    return count

# Test cases
print(generated_function('Hannah', 'n'))  # Output: 2
print(generated_function('Hannah', 'x'))  # Output: 0
print(generated_function('Hannah', 'N'))  # Output: 0
print(generated_function('Hannah', 'a'))  # Output: 2
print(generated_function('Hannah', 'h'))  # Output: 1
print(generated_function("Hannah", "n"))  ## Output: 2
print(generated_function("Hannah", "x"))  ## Output: 0
print(generated_function("Hannah", "N"))  ## Output: 0
print(generated_function("Hannah", "a"))  ## Output: 2
