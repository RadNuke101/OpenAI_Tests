Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: The input data consists of various strings that contain information about different types of advertisements, such as Adf_ROCLeader_BAN_728x90_CPM_STD, MMC_ContextualLarRec_BAN_336x280_CPM_STD, and Adf_ROC_DLBD_728x90_CPM_STD. Each input string includes details like ad type, size, pricing model, and other specifications.

The output data is a modified version of the input strings, where certain terms have been replaced or added. For example, "Branding" has been added to the first input, "Leads" has been added to the second input, and "Direct Response" has been added to the third input.

The relationship between the input and output seems to involve adding descriptive terms to specify the purpose or focus of each advertisement. For example, "Branding" may indicate that the ad is focused on brand promotion, "Leads" may suggest that the ad is designed to generate leads, and "Direct Response" may imply that the ad is intended to elicit an immediate response from viewers.

Overall, the output seems to provide additional context or clarification to the input data, helping to categorize and differentiate the different types of advertisements based on their intended goals or outcomes., and input as ['Adf_ROCLeader_BAN_728x90_CPM_STD _BRD _NRT_DCK'] output is Adf_ROCLeader_BAN_728x90_CPM_STD _Branding _NRT_DCK, input as ['MMC_ContextualLarRec_BAN_336x280_CPM_STD _LDS _RTG_DCK'] output is MMC_ContextualLarRec_BAN_336x280_CPM_STD _Leads _RTG_DCK, input as ['Adf_ROC_DLBD_728x90_CPM_STD_DRS_NRT_NOR_DCK'] output is Adf_ROC_DLBD_728x90_CPM_STD_Direct Response_NRT_NOR_DCK, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
