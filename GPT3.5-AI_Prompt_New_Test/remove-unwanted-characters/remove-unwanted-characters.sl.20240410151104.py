'''
Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Summary for Input Column Data:
- The input column data consists of strings with a combination of letters and numbers.
- Each input value is a string with a mix of alphabets and digits.

Summary for Output Column Data:
- The output column data consists of strings with a combination of letters and numbers.
- Each output value is a string with a mix of alphabets and digits.

Relationship between Input and Output:
- The output is generated by removing the first occurrence of the character specified in the input from the corresponding input string.
- The output string is derived by eliminating the first instance of the specified character from the input string.
- The relationship between the input and output is such that the specified character in the input determines which character is removed from the input string to create the output string., and input as ['zx66448', 'z'] output is x66448, input as ['zx66448', 'x'] output is z66448, input as ['zx66448', '6'] output is zx448, input as ['zx66448', '4'] output is zx668, input as ['zx66448', '8'] output is zx6644, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.

    # Remove the character at the found index to generate the output string
    output = input_str[:index] + input_str[index+1:]
