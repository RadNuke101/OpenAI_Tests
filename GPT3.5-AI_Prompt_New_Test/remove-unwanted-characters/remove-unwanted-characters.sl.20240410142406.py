Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Summary for Input Column Data:
- The input column data consists of strings with a mix of letters and numbers.
- Each input is a combination of a base string ('zx66448') and a single character ('z', 'x', '6', '4', '8').

Summary for Output Column Data:
- The output column data consists of modified strings based on the relationship between the base string and the single character.
- The output string is obtained by removing the first occurrence of the single character from the base string.

Relationship between Input and Output:
- The output string is derived by removing the first occurrence of the single character from the base string in the input.
- For example, if the base string is 'zx66448' and the single character is 'x', the output will be 'z66448' where the first 'x' is removed.
- This relationship holds true for all input-output pairs provided., and input as ['zx66448', 'z'] output is x66448, input as ['zx66448', 'x'] output is z66448, input as ['zx66448', '6'] output is zx448, input as ['zx66448', '4'] output is zx668, input as ['zx66448', '8'] output is zx6644, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
