Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Summary for Input Column Data:
- The input column data consists of strings with a combination of letters and numbers.
- Each input value is a string representing a specific code or identifier.
- The input values may contain repeating characters and vary in length.

Summary for Output Column Data:
- The output column data consists of strings with a combination of letters and numbers.
- Each output value is a modified version of the corresponding input value.
- The modification involves removing the specific character provided in the input.

Relationship between Input and Output:
- The relationship between the input and output is based on the removal of a specific character from the input string.
- The character to be removed is specified in the input column.
- The output is generated by eliminating all occurrences of the specified character from the corresponding input value.
- The output values are modified versions of the input values, with the specified character removed., and input as ['zx66448', 'z'] output is x66448, input as ['zx66448', 'x'] output is z66448, input as ['zx66448', '6'] output is zx448, input as ['zx66448', '4'] output is zx668, input as ['zx66448', '8'] output is zx6644, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
