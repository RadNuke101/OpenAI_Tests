Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Input Column Summary:
- The input column data consists of sentences with placeholders denoted by underscores, such as _username, _name1, _name2.
- The placeholders are surrounded by text, indicating that they are part of a larger context within the sentence.

Output Column Summary:
- The output column consists of the placeholders extracted from the input sentences, such as _username, _name1, _name2.

Relationship Summary:
- The relationship between the input and output columns is that the output column contains the placeholders extracted from the input sentences.
- The output column serves as a summary or extraction of the key terms or variables present in the input sentences.
- The placeholders in the input sentences are identified and isolated in the output column, providing a concise representation of the essential elements within the qualitative data., and input as ['this is a _username in the middle'] output is _username, input as ['twitter names look like= _name'] output is _name, input as ['with two _name1 and _name2'] output is _name1, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.

# Define the generated function
def generated_function(input_str):
    # Split the input string by spaces to extract the placeholders
    input_list = input_str.split()
    
    # Iterate through the input list to find the placeholder starting with underscore
    for item in input_list:
        if item.startswith('_'):
            return item

# Test cases
print(generated_function('this is a _username in the middle'))  # Output: _username
print(generated_function('twitter names look like= _name'))  # Output: _name
print(generated_function('with two _name1 and _name2'))  # Output: _name1
print(generated_function("this is a _username in the middle"))  ## Output: _username
print(generated_function("twitter names look like= _name"))  ## Output: _name
print(generated_function("with two _name1 and _name2"))  ## Output: _name1
