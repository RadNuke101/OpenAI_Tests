Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Summary for Input Column Data:
- The input column data consists of phrases with placeholders like _username and _name.

Summary for Output Column Data:
- The output column data consists of the placeholders used in the input column data, such as _username and _name.

Relationship between Input and Output:
- The relationship between the input and output is that the output column contains the placeholders found in the input column data. The output represents the specific placeholders used in the input phrases., and input as ['this is a _username in the middle'] output is _username, input as ['twitter names look like= _name'] output is _name, input as ['with two _name1 and _name2'] output is _name1, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.

    # Iterate through each word in the input string
    for word in words:
        # Check if the word contains a placeholder starting with underscore
        if word.startswith('_'):
            # Add the placeholder to the output list
            output.append(word)
    
    # Join the output list elements with a space and return as a string
    return ' '.join(output)

# Test cases
