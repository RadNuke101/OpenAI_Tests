Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Summary for Input Column Data:
- ['some project, other project']: True
- ['some project']: True
- ['overhead']: False
- ['some project, overhead']: False
- ['some project, other, boo']: True

Summary for Output Column:
- True: 3
- False: 2

Relationship between Input and Output:
Based on the provided input data, it seems that the presence of specific project names (e.g., 'some project', 'other project', 'boo') leads to the output being true. On the other hand, the presence of the term 'overhead' leads to the output being false. This suggests that the output is determined by the presence or absence of certain project names in the input data., and input as ['some project,other project'] output is true, input as ['some project'] output is true, input as ['overhead'] output is false, input as ['some project, overhead'] output is false, input as ['some project, other, boo'] output is true, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
