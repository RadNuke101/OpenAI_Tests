Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Summary for Input Column Data:
- The input column data consists of project names separated by commas.
- Some entries contain multiple project names, while others have only one project name.
- The project names vary in length and content, including words like "some project," "other project," "overhead," "boo," etc.

Summary for Output Column:
- The output column contains boolean values, either true or false.
- The output is true when the input column data contains the project name "some project" or "other" or "boo," either individually or in combination.
- The output is false when the input column data contains the project name "overhead" or any other project name not specified in the true condition.

Relationship between Input and Output:
- The output is determined based on the presence of specific project names in the input column data.
- If the input contains "some project," "other," or "boo," the output is true.
- If the input contains "overhead" or any other project name not specified in the true condition, the output is false.
- The relationship between input and output is based on specific project names and their presence in the input data., and input as ['some project,other project'] output is true, input as ['some project'] output is true, input as ['overhead'] output is false, input as ['some project, overhead'] output is false, input as ['some project, other, boo'] output is true, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
