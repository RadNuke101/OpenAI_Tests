Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Summary for Input Column Data:
1. ['some project,other project']: Both inputs are related to projects, so the output is true.
2. ['some project']: The input is related to a project, so the output is true.
3. ['overhead']: The input is not related to a project, so the output is false.
4. ['some project, overhead']: One input is related to a project and one is not, so the output is false.
5. ['some project, other, boo']: Two inputs are related to projects and one is not, so the output is true.

Summary for Output Column:
- The output is true when the input is related to a project, and false when the input is not related to a project.

Relationship between Input and Output:
- The output is determined by whether the input is related to a project or not. If all inputs are related to projects, the output is true. If any input is not related to a project, the output is false., and input as ['some project,other project'] output is true, input as ['some project'] output is true, input as ['overhead'] output is false, input as ['some project, overhead'] output is false, input as ['some project, other, boo'] output is true, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
