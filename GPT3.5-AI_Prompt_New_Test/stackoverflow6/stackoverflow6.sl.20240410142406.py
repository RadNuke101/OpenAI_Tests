Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Input Column Summary:
- The input column contains various pieces of information such as dates, times, phone numbers, and text.
- The input data seems to be in a specific format with dates, times, phone numbers, and text separated by symbols like commas, equal signs, and hyphens.

Output Column Summary:
- The output column contains text data only.
- The output column seems to be the last part of the input data, possibly representing a message or description.

Relationship Summary:
- The input data consists of structured information such as dates, times, and phone numbers, followed by unstructured text data.
- The output column seems to be derived from the unstructured text part of the input data.
- The relationship between the input and output is that the output is extracted from the text part of the input data, possibly as a message or description related to the other information provided., and input as ['Dec 2, 2014, 11=23 PM - +91 90000 80000= loren ipsum'] output is loren ipsum, input as ['Dec 2, 2014, 11=24 PM - +91 90000 80000= loren'] output is loren, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.

# Define the generated function

    parts = input_str.split(', ', 1)
    
    # Extract the last part of the input data as the output
    output = parts[1].split('= ')[1]
    
    return output
