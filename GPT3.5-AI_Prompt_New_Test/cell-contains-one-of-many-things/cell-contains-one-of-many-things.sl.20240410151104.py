Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Summary for Input Column Data:
- The input column data consists of phrases describing different scenes or objects, with each phrase containing colors and objects.
- The phrases vary in length and complexity, but all follow a similar format of color followed by object or scene description.
- The colors mentioned in the input column data are 'yellow', 'green', and 'dog', with 'yellow' and 'green' being the most common.

Summary for Output Column Data:
- The output column data consists of boolean values indicating whether the input phrase contains all three specified elements ('yellow', 'green', 'dog').
- The output is 'true' when all three elements are present in the input phrase, and 'false' when at least one element is missing.

Relationship between Input and Output:
- The relationship between the input and output is based on the presence of specific colors ('yellow' and 'green') and an object ('dog') in the input phrases.
- The output is 'true' when all three elements are present in the input phrase, indicating a match with the specified criteria.
- The output is 'false' when at least one element is missing from the input phrase, indicating a lack of match with the specified criteria.
- The input phrases that meet the criteria for the output being 'true' typically contain all three specified elements in various combinations within the phrase.
- The input phrases that result in the output being 'false' are those where one or more of the specified elements are missing, indicating a mismatch with the specified criteria., and input as ['yellow dog on green grass', 'yellow', 'green', 'dog'] output is true, input as ['warm gray sweater', 'yellow', 'green', 'dog'] output is false, input as ['A yellow sun in a green field', 'yellow', 'green', 'dog'] output is true, input as ['yellow neon sign with a green background', 'yellow', 'green', 'dog'] output is true, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
