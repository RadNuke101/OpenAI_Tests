Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Summary for Input Column Data:
- The input column data consists of phrases describing different scenes or objects.
- The phrases contain colors (yellow, green) and objects (dog) as key elements.
- The phrases vary in complexity and length, but all contain at least one of the specified colors and objects.

Summary for Output Column Data:
- The output column data consists of boolean values (true or false) indicating whether the specified colors and objects are present in the corresponding input phrase.
- The output column reflects whether the input phrases meet the criteria of containing the specified colors and objects.

Relationship between Input and Output:
- The output column serves as a filter to determine if the input phrases contain the specified colors (yellow, green) and objects (dog).
- If the output is true, it means that the input phrase includes all the specified colors and objects.
- If the output is false, it means that the input phrase does not contain all the specified colors and objects.
- The relationship between the input and output is based on the presence or absence of the specified colors and objects in the input phrases., and input as ['yellow dog on green grass', 'yellow', 'green', 'dog'] output is true, input as ['warm gray sweater', 'yellow', 'green', 'dog'] output is false, input as ['A yellow sun in a green field', 'yellow', 'green', 'dog'] output is true, input as ['yellow neon sign with a green background', 'yellow', 'green', 'dog'] output is true, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.

# Define the generated function
def generated_function(input_str, color1, color2, obj):
    # Check if all specified colors and object are present in the input phrase
    if color1 in input_str and color2 in input_str and obj in input_str:
        return 'true'
    else:
        return 'false'

# Test cases
print(generated_function('yellow dog on green grass', 'yellow', 'green', 'dog')) # Output: true
print(generated_function('warm gray sweater', 'yellow', 'green', 'dog')) # Output: false
print(generated_function('A yellow sun in a green field', 'yellow', 'green', 'dog')) # Output: true
print(generated_function('yellow neon sign with a green background', 'yellow', 'green', 'dog')) # Output: true
print(generated_function("yellow dog on green grass", "yellow", "green", "dog"))  ## Output: true
print(generated_function("warm gray sweater", "yellow", "green", "dog"))  ## Output: false
print(generated_function("A yellow sun in a green field", "yellow", "green", "dog"))  ## Output: true
print(generated_function("yellow neon sign with a green background", "yellow", "green", "dog"))  ## Output: true
