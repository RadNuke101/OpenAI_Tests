Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Summary for Input Column Data:
- The input column data consists of qualitative values represented as strings.
- Each value in the input column represents a unique input.

Summary for Output Column Data:
- The output column data consists of qualitative values represented as strings.
- Each value in the output column represents a unique output.

Relationship between Input and Output:
- The input values are directly related to the output values, with each unique input corresponding to a unique output.
- The input values serve as the basis for determining the output values.
- There is a one-to-one relationship between the input and output values, with no apparent pattern or correlation between them., and input as ['101'] output is 101, input as ['1002'] output is 1002, input as ['743'] output is 743, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.

    # Return the input string as output
    return input_str

# Test cases
print(generated_function('101'))  # Output: 101
print(generated_function('1002'))  # Output: 1002
print(generated_function('743'))  # Output: 743
print(generated_function("101"))  ## Output: 101
print(generated_function("1002"))  ## Output: 1002
