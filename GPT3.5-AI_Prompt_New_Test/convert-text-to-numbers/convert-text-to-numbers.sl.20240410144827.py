Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Summary for Input Column Data:
- The input column data consists of qualitative values represented as strings.
- Each value in the input column represents a unique identifier or code.

Summary for Output Column Data:
- The output column data consists of numerical values.
- Each value in the output column represents a corresponding unique identifier or code from the input column data.

Relationship between Input and Output:
- The relationship between the input and output is a direct mapping where each unique identifier or code in the input column corresponds to a numerical value in the output column.
- The output column serves as a representation or transformation of the input column data into a different format.
- The input column data is used as a reference to generate the output column data, maintaining the integrity of the unique identifiers or codes., and input as ['101'] output is 101, input as ['1002'] output is 1002, input as ['743'] output is 743, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.

    # Convert the input string to integer and return it
    return int(input_str)

# Test cases
print(generated_function('101'))  # Output: 101
print(generated_function('1002'))  # Output: 1002
print(generated_function('743'))  # Output: 743
print(generated_function("101"))  ## Output: 101
print(generated_function("1002"))  ## Output: 1002
