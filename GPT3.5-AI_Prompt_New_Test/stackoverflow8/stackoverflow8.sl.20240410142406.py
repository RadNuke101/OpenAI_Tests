Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Input Column 1 Summary:
- The input column contains file paths in the format 'home/folder/filename'. 
- The file paths are structured with a 'home' directory followed by subdirectories and a file name.

Output Column Summary:
- The output column contains only the file names extracted from the input file paths.
- The file names in the output column are 'Sheet1.xls' in both cases.

Relationship between Input and Output:
- The relationship between the input and output is that the output column extracts and displays only the file names from the input file paths.
- The output column simplifies the information by providing only the final file name, removing the directory structure.
- The output column serves as a summary or simplification of the information present in the input column, focusing on the essential data., and input as ['home/Excel/Sheet1.xls'] output is Sheet1.xls, input as ['home/user/Sheet1.xls'] output is Sheet1.xls, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.

# Define the generated function

    file_path = input_str.split('/')[-1]
    return file_path

# Test cases
print(generated_function('home/Excel/Sheet1.xls')) # Output: Sheet1.xls
print(generated_function('home/user/Sheet1.xls')) # Output: Sheet1.xls
print(generated_function("home/Excel/Sheet1.xls"))  ## Output: Sheet1.xls
print(generated_function("home/user/Sheet1.xls"))  ## Output: Sheet1.xls
