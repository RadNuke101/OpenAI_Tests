Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Input Column Data Summary:
- The input column data consists of file paths in the format 'home/folder/filename.extension'.
- The data appears to represent file paths within a directory structure.
- The file paths contain a combination of folder names and file names with extensions.

Output Column Data Summary:
- The output column data consists of file names with extensions extracted from the input file paths.
- The output column contains only the file names with extensions, excluding the folder names.
- The output column provides a simplified version of the file paths present in the input column.

Relationship Summary:
- The relationship between the input and output columns is that the output column extracts and displays only the file names with extensions from the input file paths.
- The output column serves as a summary or simplified representation of the input file paths, focusing solely on the file names.
- The output column helps to highlight and emphasize the specific files present in the input paths, making it easier to identify and reference individual files.
- By extracting and displaying only the file names, the output column streamlines the information provided in the input column, making it more concise and user-friendly., and input as ['home/Excel/Sheet1.xls'] output is Sheet1.xls, input as ['home/user/Sheet1.xls'] output is Sheet1.xls, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.

# Define the generated function
def generated_function(input_str):
    # Split the input string by '/' and extract the last element as the file name with extension
    file_name = input_str.split('/')[-1]
    
    # Return the extracted file name
    return file_name

# Test cases
print(generated_function('home/Excel/Sheet1.xls'))  # Output: Sheet1.xls
print(generated_function('home/user/Sheet1.xls'))   # Output: Sheet1.xls
print(generated_function("home/Excel/Sheet1.xls"))  ## Output: Sheet1.xls
print(generated_function("home/user/Sheet1.xls"))  ## Output: Sheet1.xls
