Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Summary for Input Column Data:
- The input column data consists of qualitative information in the format 'Jones <number>'. The numbers in the input data represent some kind of attribute or value associated with the name 'Jones'.

Summary for Output Column:
- The output column consists of numerical values that correspond to the numbers present in the input data. These numbers seem to be directly related to the input data and likely represent a specific characteristic or score associated with the name 'Jones'.

Relationship between Input and Output:
- The input data provides qualitative information about 'Jones', while the output data represents a numerical value associated with each input. It appears that the numbers in the input data directly translate to the output values, indicating a clear relationship between the qualitative information provided and the corresponding numerical output. The output values seem to be derived from the numbers present in the input data, suggesting a direct connection between the two., and input as ['Jones <60>'] output is 60, input as ['Jones <57>'] output is 57, input as ['Jones <55>'] output is 55, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.

# Define the generated function
def generated_function(input_str):
    # Extract the number from the input string
    number = int(input_str.split('<')[1].strip('>').strip())
    
    # Return the extracted number as the output
    return number

# Test cases
print(generated_function('Jones <60>'))  # Output: 60
