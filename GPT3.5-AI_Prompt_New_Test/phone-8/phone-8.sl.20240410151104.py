Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: For the input column data, it appears to consist of phone numbers with country codes and three sets of numbers separated by hyphens. The country codes vary in length, and the sets of numbers after the country code are also different in length. The input data seems to follow a consistent format of country code followed by three sets of numbers.

As for the output column data, it consists of the last set of numbers from each input phone number. This set of numbers varies in length and does not seem to follow a specific pattern based on the input data.

The relationship between the input and output columns is that the output column always corresponds to the last set of numbers in each input phone number. The output column seems to be extracted from the input data by isolating the last set of numbers. This relationship suggests that the output column serves as a simplified version or a specific component of the input data, focusing only on the final set of numbers in each phone number., and input as ['+106 769-858-438'] output is 438, input as ['+83 973-757-831'] output is 831, input as ['+62 647-787-775'] output is 775, input as ['+172 027-507-632'] output is 632, input as ['+72 001-050-856'] output is 856, input as ['+95 310-537-401'] output is 401, input as ['+6 775-969-238'] output is 238, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
