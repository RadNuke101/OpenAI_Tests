'''
Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Summary for Input Column Data:
- The input column data consists of phrases containing placeholders enclosed in angle brackets, such as "<string>", "<changed>", and "<a>".
- The phrases in the input column data are structured as sentences or statements with placeholders for specific terms.

Summary for Output Column Data:
- The output column data consists of phrases where the placeholders in the input column data have been replaced with actual terms, resulting in coherent sentences.
- The output column data reflects the transformation of the placeholders in the input column data into meaningful terms.

Relationship between Input and Output:
- The relationship between the input and output is that the placeholders in the input column data are replaced with actual terms in the output column data.
- The transformation process involves converting the placeholders in the input into concrete terms to create coherent sentences in the output.
- The output column data represents the result of replacing placeholders with specific terms based on the context provided in the input column data., and input as ['This is a <string>, It should be <changed> to <a> number.'] output is This is a string, It should be changed to a number., input as ['a < 4 and a > 0'] output is a  4 and a  0, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
