Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Summary for Input Column Data:
- The first input column data contains a sentence with placeholders denoted by "<>". 
- The second input column data contains a mathematical expression with a variable "a" and comparison operators.

Summary for Output Column Data:
- The output column data shows the input sentences with placeholders replaced by actual values.

Relationship between Input and Output:
- The input column data contains placeholders that need to be replaced with actual values.
- The output column data shows the input sentences with the placeholders replaced by the corresponding values.
- The relationship between input and output is that the placeholders in the input are replaced by the values to form meaningful sentences or expressions in the output., and input as ['This is a <string>, It should be <changed> to <a> number.'] output is This is a string, It should be changed to a number., input as ['a < 4 and a > 0'] output is a  4 and a  0, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.

print(generated_function("This is a <string>, It should be <changed> to <a> number."))  ## Output: This is a string, It should be changed to a number.
print(generated_function("a < 4 and a > 0"))  ## Output: a  4 and a  0
