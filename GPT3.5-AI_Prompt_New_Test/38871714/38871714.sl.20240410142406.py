Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Summary for Input Column 1: The input data in column 1 consists of sentences with placeholders enclosed in angle brackets. The placeholders include words such as "string," "changed," and "a number."

Summary for Output Column: The output data consists of sentences where the placeholders have been replaced with actual words or numbers. 

Relationship Summary: The input data contains placeholders that need to be replaced with specific values. The output data shows the result of replacing these placeholders. The relationship between the input and output is that the placeholders in the input are substituted with actual words or numbers to form coherent sentences in the output., and input as ['This is a <string>, It should be <changed> to <a> number.'] output is This is a string, It should be changed to a number., input as ['a < 4 and a > 0'] output is a  4 and a  0, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.

# Define the generated function
def generated_function(input_str):
    # Replace placeholders with actual words or numbers
    output_str = input_str.replace('<string>', 'string').replace('<changed>', 'changed').replace('<a>', 'a').replace('< 4', ' 4').replace('a > 0', 'a  0')
    
    return output_str

# Test cases
print(generated_function('This is a <string>, It should be <changed> to <a> number.'))
print(generated_function('a < 4 and a > 0'))
print(generated_function("This is a <string>, It should be <changed> to <a> number."))  ## Output: This is a string, It should be changed to a number.
print(generated_function("a < 4 and a > 0"))  ## Output: a  4 and a  0

print(generated_function("This is a <number>, It should be <updated> to <a> string."))  ### Output: This is a number, It should be updated to a string.
print(generated_function("This is a <number>, It <should> be <updated> to <a> <string>."))  ### Output: This is a number, It should be updated to a string.
print(generated_function("a <> 0"))  ### Output: a  0
