Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: **Input Column Data Summary:**

1. ['happy.jpg']: The input column contains the word "happy" which is a positive emotion.

2. ['pivot table.xls']: The input column contains the term "pivot table" which is a data analysis tool used in Excel.

3. ['sales data.csv']: The input column contains the phrase "sales data" which likely refers to information related to sales transactions.

4. ['invoice3001.xls.pdf']: The input column contains the term "invoice3001" which suggests it is a specific invoice number.

**Output Column Summary:**

The output column contains the extracted keywords from the input data, such as "happy", "pivot table", "sales data", and "invoice3001".

**Relationship Summary:**

The relationship between the input and output columns is that the output column extracts relevant keywords or phrases from the input data. The output column serves as a summary or key identifier for the input data, providing a quick reference point for understanding the content of the input. This relationship helps in quickly identifying the main subject or topic of the input data without having to read through the entire text., and input as ['happy.jpg'] output is happy, input as ['pivot table.xls'] output is pivot table, input as ['sales data.csv'] output is sales data, input as ['invoice3001.xls.pdf'] output is invoice3001, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
