Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Summary for input column 'year':
- The input column 'year' contains the value '2016'.

Summary for input column 'make':
- The input column 'make' contains the value 'subaru'.

Summary for input column 'model':
- The input column 'model' contains the value 'outback wagon'.

Summary for input column 'fuel economy':
- The input column 'fuel economy' contains the value '25/33'.

Summary for output column:
- The output column contains the values '2016', 'subaru', 'outback wagon', and '25/33'.

Relationship between input columns and output:
- The input columns 'year', 'make', 'model', and 'fuel economy' provide specific details about a vehicle. In this case, the output column seems to represent the characteristics of a particular car, with 'year' indicating the manufacturing year, 'make' representing the brand, 'model' specifying the model name, and 'fuel economy' showing the fuel efficiency ratings. The relationship between the input columns and the output suggests that they collectively describe a single vehicle, possibly a Subaru Outback Wagon manufactured in 2016 with a fuel economy of 25 miles per gallon in the city and 33 miles per gallon on the highway., and input as ['year= 2016'] output is 2016, input as ['make= subaru'] output is subaru, input as ['model= outback wagon'] output is outback wagon, input as ['fuel economy= 25/33'] output is 25/33, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.

# Define the generated function
def generated_function(year, make, model, fuel_economy):
    # Return the output as a string
    return f"{year}, {make}, {model}, {fuel_economy}"

# Test cases with the given input
print(generated_function('2016', 'subaru', 'outback wagon', '25/33'))
print(generated_function("year= 2016"))  ## Output: 2016
print(generated_function("make= subaru"))  ## Output: subaru
print(generated_function("model= outback wagon"))  ## Output: outback wagon
print(generated_function("fuel economy= 25/33"))  ## Output: 25/33
