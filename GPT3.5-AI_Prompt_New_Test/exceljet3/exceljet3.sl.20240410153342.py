Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Summary for input column 'year':
- The input column 'year' contains the following values: 2016.
- The values in this column represent different years.

Summary for input column 'make':
- The input column 'make' contains the following values: subaru.
- The values in this column represent different car makes.

Summary for input column 'model':
- The input column 'model' contains the following values: outback wagon.
- The values in this column represent different car models.

Summary for input column 'fuel economy':
- The input column 'fuel economy' contains the following values: 25/33.
- The values in this column represent different fuel economy ratings.

Summary for output column:
- The output column contains the following values: 2016, subaru, outback wagon, 25/33.
- The output values represent different attributes of a car, such as the year, make, model, and fuel economy.

Relationship between input and output:
- The input columns 'year', 'make', 'model', and 'fuel economy' provide specific details about a car.
- The output column combines these details to describe a specific car, such as a 2016 Subaru Outback Wagon with a fuel economy rating of 25/33.
- The input columns collectively contribute to creating a comprehensive description of the output., and input as ['year= 2016'] output is 2016, input as ['make= subaru'] output is subaru, input as ['model= outback wagon'] output is outback wagon, input as ['fuel economy= 25/33'] output is 25/33, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
