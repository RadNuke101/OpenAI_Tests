Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Summary for input columns:
1. year: The input column contains the year 2016.
2. make: The input column contains the make Subaru.
3. model: The input column contains the model Outback Wagon.
4. fuel economy: The input column contains the fuel economy range 25/33.

Summary for output column:
The output column contains the values 2016, Subaru, Outback Wagon, and 25/33.

Relationship between input and output:
The input columns provide specific details about a vehicle, such as the year, make, model, and fuel economy. The output column combines these details to describe a specific vehicle, which in this case is a 2016 Subaru Outback Wagon with a fuel economy range of 25/33. The relationship between the input and output is that the input columns provide individual characteristics of the vehicle, while the output column combines these characteristics to describe the vehicle as a whole., and input as ['year= 2016'] output is 2016, input as ['make= subaru'] output is subaru, input as ['model= outback wagon'] output is outback wagon, input as ['fuel economy= 25/33'] output is 25/33, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.

# Define the generated function
def generated_function(year, make, model, fuel_economy):
    # Combine the input values to form the output
    output = f"{year}, {make}, {model}, {fuel_economy}"
    return output

# Test cases
input1 = "2016"
input2 = "subaru"
input3 = "outback wagon"
input4 = "25/33"

# Call the generated function with the test inputs
result = generated_function(input1, input2, input3, input4)
print(generated_function("year= 2016"))  ## Output: 2016
print(generated_function("make= subaru"))  ## Output: subaru
print(generated_function("model= outback wagon"))  ## Output: outback wagon
print(generated_function("fuel economy= 25/33"))  ## Output: 25/33
