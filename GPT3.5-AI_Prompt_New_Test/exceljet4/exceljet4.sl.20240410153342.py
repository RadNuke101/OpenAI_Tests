Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Summary for Input Column Data:
- The input column data consists of URLs with different protocols such as 'https', 'ftp', and 'sftp'.

Summary for Output Column Data:
- The output column data consists of the domain names or IP addresses extracted from the input URLs.

Relationship between Input and Output:
- The input column data contains URLs with various protocols, and the output column data extracts and displays the domain names or IP addresses from these URLs. The relationship between the input and output is that the output simplifies and presents the essential information (domain name or IP address) from the input URLs, regardless of the protocol used. This process helps in identifying and accessing the specific server or website associated with each URL., and input as ['https=//exceljet.net/catalog'] output is exceljet.net/catalog, input as ['https=//microsoft.com'] output is microsoft.com, input as ['ftp=//someserver.com'] output is someserver.com, input as ['sftp=//127.0.0.1'] output is 127.0.0.1, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.

# Define the generated function
def generated_function(input_str):
    # Split the input string to separate the protocol and URL
    protocol, url = input_str.split('=')
    
    # Extract the domain name or IP address from the URL
    if '//' in url:
        domain = url.split('//')[1]
    else:
        domain = url
    
    return domain
