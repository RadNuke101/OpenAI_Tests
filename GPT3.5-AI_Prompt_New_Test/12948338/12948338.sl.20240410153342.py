Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: For the first input, the word "username" appears twice in the input string. This suggests that the output value, which is also "username", is directly related to the occurrences of this word in the input.

For the second input, the word "AwesomeUser" appears once in the input string. This indicates that the output value, which is "AwesomeUser", is directly related to the occurrence of this word in the input.

For the third input, the word "example" appears three times in the input string. This suggests that the output value, which is also "example", is directly related to the occurrences of this word in the input.

Overall, the relationship between the input and output columns seems to be based on the frequency of the specific word mentioned in the input string. The output value is directly related to the number of times the corresponding word appears in the input., and input as ['An example string with _username in it RT _AwesomeUser says _username is awesome', 'username'] output is 2, input as ['An example string with _username in it RT _AwesomeUser says _username is awesome', 'AwesomeUser'] output is 1, input as ['An _example string with _example in it is awesome _example', 'example'] output is 3, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
