Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Summary for Input Column Data:
- The input column data consists of various domain names such as 'www.domain.com', 'mail.net', and 'www.amaon.co.uk'.
- The domain names vary in length and structure, with some including prefixes like 'www' and others having country-specific extensions like 'co.uk'.

Summary for Output Column Data:
- The output column data consists of domain extensions such as 'com', 'net', and 'uk'.
- The domain extensions represent the top-level domain of the website, indicating the country or type of organization associated with the domain.

Relationship between Input and Output:
- The output column data (domain extensions) is derived from the input column data (domain names) by extracting the last part of the domain name after the last period.
- The relationship between the input and output is that the output provides information about the type or location of the website based on the domain extension, which is a crucial aspect of website identification and categorization., and input as ['www.domain.com'] output is com, input as ['mail.net'] output is net, input as ['www.amaon.co.uk'] output is uk, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
