Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Summary for Input Column Data:
- The input column data consists of domain names in various formats, including '.com', '.net', and '.co.uk'.

Summary for Output Column:
- The output column consists of top-level domain extensions such as 'com', 'net', and 'uk'.

Relationship between Input and Output:
- The output column represents the top-level domain extension of the input domain names. The relationship between the input and output is that the output column captures the last part of the domain name, which indicates the type of domain extension used., and input as ['www.domain.com'] output is com, input as ['mail.net'] output is net, input as ['www.amaon.co.uk'] output is uk, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.

    output = input_str.split('.')[-1]
    
    return output

# Test cases
print(generated_function('www.domain.com'))  # Output: com
print(generated_function('mail.net'))  # Output: net
print(generated_function('www.amazon.co.uk'))  # Output: uk
