Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Summary for Input Column Data:
The input column data consists of domain names with different extensions such as .com, .net, and .co.uk.

Summary for Output Column:
The output column consists of the domain extensions such as com, net, and uk.

Relationship between Input and Output:
The output column represents the domain extensions present in the input column data. The relationship between the input and output is that the output column captures the last part of the domain name, which is the domain extension. The input column data provides the full domain name, while the output column simplifies it to just the domain extension., and input as ['www.domain.com'] output is com, input as ['mail.net'] output is net, input as ['www.amaon.co.uk'] output is uk, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.

    # Split the input string by '.' and get the last element
    output = input_str.split('.')[-1]
    
    return output

# Test cases
