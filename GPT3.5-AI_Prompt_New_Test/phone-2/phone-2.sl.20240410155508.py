Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: For the input columns, each column contains a series of phone numbers in the format XXX-XXX-XXX. The numbers in each column are unique and do not repeat. There is no apparent pattern or relationship between the numbers in each column.

As for the output column, it appears to represent the last set of numbers in each phone number. For example, in the input ['938-242-504'], the output is 504, which is the last set of numbers in the phone number. Similarly, for all other inputs, the output corresponds to the last set of numbers in the phone number.

Therefore, the relationship between the input and the output is that the output column represents the last set of numbers in each phone number in the input columns., and input as ['938-242-504'] output is 504, input as ['308-916-545'] output is 545, input as ['623-599-749'] output is 749, input as ['981-424-843'] output is 843, input as ['118-980-214'] output is 214, input as ['244-655-094'] output is 094, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
