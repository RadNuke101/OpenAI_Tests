Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Summary for Input Column Data:
- The input column data consists of phone numbers in the format XXX-XXX-XXX.
- Each phone number is unique and does not repeat in the dataset.
- The first set of numbers in each phone number seems to be random and does not follow a specific pattern.
- The second set of numbers in each phone number varies between different values.

Summary for Output Column Data:
- The output column data consists of the middle set of numbers from each phone number in the input column.
- The middle set of numbers in each phone number seems to be the focus of attention in this dataset.
- The middle set of numbers varies between different values and is the key factor in determining the output.

Relationship between Input and Output:
- The output column data is derived from the middle set of numbers in each phone number from the input column.
- The middle set of numbers seems to be the main factor that determines the output value.
- There is a direct relationship between the input and output, where the middle set of numbers in the input corresponds to the output value.
- The middle set of numbers plays a crucial role in determining the final output, as seen in the provided examples., and input as ['938-242-504'] output is 242, input as ['308-916-545'] output is 916, input as ['623-599-749'] output is 599, input as ['981-424-843'] output is 424, input as ['118-980-214'] output is 980, input as ['244-655-094'] output is 655, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.

# Define the generated function
def generated_function(input_str):
    # Split the input string by '-' and extract the middle set of numbers
    middle_set = input_str.split('-')[1]
    
    # Return the middle set of numbers as the output
    return middle_set
