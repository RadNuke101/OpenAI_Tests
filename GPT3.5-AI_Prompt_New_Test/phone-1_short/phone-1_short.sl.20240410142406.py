Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Summary for Input Column Data:
- The input column data consists of phone numbers in the format XXX-XXX-XXX.
- Each phone number is unique and does not repeat within the dataset.
- The first set of numbers before the first hyphen seems to be random and does not follow a specific pattern.
- The second set of numbers between the first and second hyphen varies across the dataset.
- The third set of numbers after the second hyphen also varies across the dataset.

Summary for Output Column Data:
- The output column data consists of the middle set of numbers from each phone number in the input column.
- The output values are different for each input phone number.
- The output values do not seem to follow a specific pattern or sequence based on the input values.
- The output values are not directly related to the first or third set of numbers in the input phone numbers.

Relationship between Input and Output:
- The relationship between the input and output columns is that the output column consists of the middle set of numbers from each input phone number.
- The output values do not appear to be directly influenced by the first or third set of numbers in the input phone numbers.
- The output values seem to be randomly selected from the second set of numbers in the input phone numbers.
- There is no apparent pattern or correlation between the input and output values based on the provided dataset., and input as ['938-242-504'] output is 242, input as ['308-916-545'] output is 916, input as ['623-599-749'] output is 599, input as ['981-424-843'] output is 424, input as ['118-980-214'] output is 980, input as ['244-655-094'] output is 655, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
