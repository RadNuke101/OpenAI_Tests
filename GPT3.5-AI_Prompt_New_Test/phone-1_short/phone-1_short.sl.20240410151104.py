Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Summary for Input Column Data:
- The input column data consists of phone numbers in the format XXX-XXX-XXX.
- Each phone number is unique and does not repeat within the input column data.
- The first three digits in each phone number do not follow a specific pattern or sequence.

Summary for Output Column Data:
- The output column data consists of the middle three digits from each phone number in the input column data.
- The middle three digits vary between each phone number and do not follow a specific pattern or sequence.

Relationship between Input and Output:
- The output column data represents the middle three digits from each phone number in the input column data.
- There is no apparent relationship or pattern between the first three digits of the phone number and the middle three digits that are extracted as the output.
- The middle three digits seem to be randomly distributed and do not have a direct correlation with the first three digits of the phone numbers., and input as ['938-242-504'] output is 242, input as ['308-916-545'] output is 916, input as ['623-599-749'] output is 599, input as ['981-424-843'] output is 424, input as ['118-980-214'] output is 980, input as ['244-655-094'] output is 655, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
