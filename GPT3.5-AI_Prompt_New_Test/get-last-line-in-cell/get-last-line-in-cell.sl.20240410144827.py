Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Summary for Input Column 1:
- The input column contains dates and descriptions of different activities related to a call or order.
- The entries in the input column are separated by slashes (/) and dashes (-).
- The entries include details such as the date, type of activity (e.g., first call, order placed), and additional information (e.g., follow-up, interested).

Summary for Output Column:
- The output column contains a single entry that includes a date and additional information related to a follow-up activity.
- The entry in the output column is separated by a comma.
- The output entry includes the date of the follow-up activity and additional details (e.g., interested).

Relationship between Input and Output:
- The output entry in the output column is derived from the last entry in the input column.
- The output entry specifically relates to a follow-up activity that occurred after the initial activities mentioned in the input column.
- The input column provides a chronological sequence of events leading up to the follow-up activity described in the output column., and input as ['11/1/2015 - First call/n12/3/2015-order placed/n11/15/2015-follow-up,interested'] output is 11/15/2015-follow-up,interested, input as ['11/1/2015 - First call/n12/3/2015-order placed'] output is 12/3/2015-order placed, input as ['11/1/2015 - First call'] output is 11/1/2015 - First call, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
