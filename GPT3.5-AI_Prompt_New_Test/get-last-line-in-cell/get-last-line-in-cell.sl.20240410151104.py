Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Summary for Input Column 1:
- The input column data consists of dates followed by descriptions of activities such as "First call", "Order placed", and "Follow-up, interested".

Summary for Output Column:
- The output column data consists of a single entry that includes a date and a description of an activity, such as "Follow-up, interested".

Relationship between Input and Output:
- The output column seems to be derived from the last entry in the input column, where the date and description of the activity are combined. The output provides a concise summary of the final activity mentioned in the input column., and input as ['11/1/2015 - First call/n12/3/2015-order placed/n11/15/2015-follow-up,interested'] output is 11/15/2015-follow-up,interested, input as ['11/1/2015 - First call/n12/3/2015-order placed'] output is 12/3/2015-order placed, input as ['11/1/2015 - First call'] output is 11/1/2015 - First call, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
