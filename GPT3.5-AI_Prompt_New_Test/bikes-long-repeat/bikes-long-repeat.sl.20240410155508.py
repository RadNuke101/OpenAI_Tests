Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Summary for Input Column Data:
- The input column data consists of various motorcycle brands followed by a numeric value (e.g., Ducati100, Honda125, Acura100).
- The motorcycle brands included in the input data are Ducati, Honda, Acura, Ferrari.
- Each brand appears multiple times in the input data with different numeric values.

Summary for Output Column Data:
- The output column data consists of the motorcycle brands extracted from the input data without the numeric values (e.g., Ducati, Honda, Acura, Ferrari).
- The output column includes the brands Ducati, Honda, Acura, Ferrari.
- Each brand appears multiple times in the output data.

Relationship between Input and Output:
- The relationship between the input and output data is that the output column contains only the motorcycle brand names extracted from the input data without the numeric values.
- The output column reflects the different motorcycle brands present in the input data, such as Ducati, Honda, Acura, and Ferrari.
- The output column serves as a summary of the motorcycle brands represented in the input data, providing a clear overview of the brands without the accompanying numeric values., and input as ['Ducati100'] output is Ducati, input as ['Ducati100'] output is Ducati, input as ['Ducati100'] output is Ducati, input as ['Honda125'] output is Honda, input as ['Honda125'] output is Honda, input as ['Honda125'] output is Honda, input as ['Ducati250'] output is Ducati, input as ['Ducati250'] output is Ducati, input as ['Ducati250'] output is Ducati, input as ['Honda250'] output is Honda, input as ['Honda250'] output is Honda, input as ['Honda250'] output is Honda, input as ['Honda550'] output is Honda, input as ['Honda550'] output is Honda, input as ['Honda550'] output is Honda, input as ['Ducati125'] output is Ducati, input as ['Ducati125'] output is Ducati, input as ['Ducati125'] output is Ducati, input as ['Acura100'] output is Acura, input as ['Acura100'] output is Acura, input as ['Acura100'] output is Acura, input as ['Acura125'] output is Acura, input as ['Ferrari250'] output is Ferrari, input as ['Ferrari250'] output is Ferrari, input as ['Ferrari250'] output is Ferrari, input as ['Ferrari250'] output is Ferrari, input as ['Honda550'] output is Honda, input as ['Honda550'] output is Honda, input as ['Honda550'] output is Honda, input as ['Ducati125'] output is Ducati, input as ['Ducati125'] output is Ducati, input as ['Ducati125'] output is Ducati, input as ['Ducati100'] output is Ducati, input as ['Honda125'] output is Honda, input as ['Honda125'] output is Honda, input as ['Honda125'] output is Honda, input as ['Ducati250'] output is Ducati, input as ['Honda250'] output is Honda, input as ['Honda250'] output is Honda, input as ['Honda250'] output is Honda, input as ['Honda550'] output is Honda, input as ['Ducati125'] output is Ducati, input as ['Ducati125'] output is Ducati, input as ['Ducati125'] output is Ducati, input as ['Acura100'] output is Acura, input as ['Acura125'] output is Acura, input as ['Acura125'] output is Acura, input as ['Acura125'] output is Acura, input as ['Ferrari250'] output is Ferrari, input as ['Ferrari250'] output is Ferrari, input as ['Ferrari250'] output is Ferrari, input as ['Honda550'] output is Honda, input as ['Honda550'] output is Honda, input as ['Honda550'] output is Honda, input as ['Ducati125'] output is Ducati, input as ['Ducati125'] output is Ducati, input as ['Ducati125'] output is Ducati, input as ['Ducati125'] output is Ducati, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
