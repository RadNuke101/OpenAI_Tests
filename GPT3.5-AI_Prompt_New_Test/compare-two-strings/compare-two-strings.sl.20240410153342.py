Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Summary for Input Column Data:
- The input column data consists of fruit names in lowercase and uppercase letters.
- There are repetitions of the same fruit name in both lowercase and uppercase letters.
- The input column data includes fruits like apple, orange, peach, and cherry.

Summary for Output Column Data:
- The output column data consists of boolean values (true or false) indicating whether the input fruit names are the same regardless of case.
- The output column data shows true when the input fruit names are the same regardless of case and false when they are different.

Relationship between Input and Output:
- The output column data is determined by comparing the input fruit names in a case-insensitive manner.
- If the input fruit names are the same regardless of case, the output is true; otherwise, it is false.
- The relationship between input and output is based on the equality of fruit names, ignoring the case of the letters., and input as ['apple', 'apple'] output is true, input as ['orange', 'Orange'] output is false, input as ['peach', 'peach'] output is true, input as ['cherry', 'cherrY'] output is false, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
