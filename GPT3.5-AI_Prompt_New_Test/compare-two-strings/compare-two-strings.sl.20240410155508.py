Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Summary for Input Column Data:
- The input column data consists of various fruits such as apple, orange, peach, and cherry.
- The data includes both lowercase and uppercase variations of the fruit names.

Summary for Output Column Data:
- The output column data consists of boolean values (true or false) indicating whether the two input values are the same (true) or different (false).

Relationship between Input and Output:
- The output column is determined by comparing the two input values and checking if they are the same or different.
- The output is true when the input values are the same, regardless of the case (e.g., 'apple' and 'apple').
- The output is false when the input values are different, even if they are the same fruit but with different cases (e.g., 'orange' and 'Orange').
- The relationship between the input and output is based on the equality of the input values, with case sensitivity taken into account., and input as ['apple', 'apple'] output is true, input as ['orange', 'Orange'] output is false, input as ['peach', 'peach'] output is true, input as ['cherry', 'cherrY'] output is false, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
