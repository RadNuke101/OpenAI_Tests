Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Summary for Input Column Data:
The input column data consists of phone numbers in the format of country code followed by three sets of numbers separated by hyphens. Each set of numbers seems to be randomly generated and does not follow any specific pattern. 

Summary for Output Column Data:
The output column data consists of the middle set of numbers from each phone number. This middle set of numbers varies in each input, indicating that there is no direct relationship or pattern between the input and output. The middle set of numbers seems to be randomly generated and does not follow any specific rule based on the input.

Relationship between Input and Output:
Based on the provided data, there does not seem to be a clear relationship between the input phone numbers and the output numbers. The output numbers (middle set of numbers) do not appear to be derived from any specific pattern or rule based on the input. Each output number seems to be randomly selected from the corresponding input phone number., and input as ['+106 769-858-438'] output is 858, input as ['+83 973-757-831'] output is 757, input as ['+62 647-787-775'] output is 787, input as ['+172 027-507-632'] output is 507, input as ['+72 001-050-856'] output is 050, input as ['+95 310-537-401'] output is 537, input as ['+6 775-969-238'] output is 969, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
