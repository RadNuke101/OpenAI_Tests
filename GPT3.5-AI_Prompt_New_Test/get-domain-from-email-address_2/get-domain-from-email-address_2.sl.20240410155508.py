Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Summary for Input Column 1:
The input column 1 contains names of individuals, with the format of first name followed by last name. The names are in a standard format with a space separating the first and last name.

Summary for Input Column 2:
The input column 2 contains email addresses, with the format of username followed by domain. The usernames are a combination of letters and possibly underscores, while the domain names are in the typical format of domain extensions like .com, .uk, etc.

Summary for Output Column:
The output column contains usernames extracted from the email addresses in the input column 2. The usernames are a shortened version of the original email addresses, typically taking the first few characters of the username before an underscore or period.

Relationship between Input and Output:
The output usernames seem to be derived from the email addresses by taking the first few characters of the username before an underscore or period. This relationship suggests that the output is a truncated version of the input email addresses, specifically focusing on the username part. The output usernames retain some similarity to the original usernames but are shortened for brevity., and input as ['ann chang', 'achang_maaker.com'] output is achang, input as ['bobby smith', 'bobt_sphynx.uk.co'] output is bobt, input as ['art lennox', 'art.lennox_svxn.com'] output is art.lennox, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
