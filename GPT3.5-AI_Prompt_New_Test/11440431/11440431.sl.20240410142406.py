Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Summary for Input Column Data:
1. The input column data consists of various industries or activities such as Mining, Soybean Farming, Oil Extraction, and Fishing.
2. The input data includes information about the type of industry or activity and the location (if specified).

Summary for Output Column Data:
1. The output column data consists of the main activity or industry, such as Mining, Soybean Farming, Oil Extraction, and Fishing.

Relationship between Input and Output:
1. The input column data provides details about the specific industry or activity, including the location.
2. The output column data focuses on the main activity or industry without considering the location.
3. The relationship between the input and output is that the output column simplifies the input data by highlighting the main activity or industry, regardless of the location., and input as ['Mining US'] output is Mining, input as ['Soybean Farming CAN'] output is Soybean Farming, input as ['Soybean Farming'] output is Soybean Farming, input as ['Oil Extraction US'] output is Oil Extraction, input as ['Fishing'] output is Fishing, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
