'''
Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: The input data consists of various words that all contain the substring "that". The output column consistently removes this substring to reveal the core word. The relationship between the input and output is that the output is derived by removing the common substring "that" from each input word. This process results in a transformation that simplifies the words and highlights their core meanings. The output column serves as a distilled version of the input data, emphasizing the essential elements of each word., and input as ['thatensures'] output is ensures, input as ['thatwill'] output is will, input as ['thathave'] output is have, input as ['knowthat'] output is know, input as ['that'] output is that, input as ['mouse'] output is mouse, input as ['knowthat'] output is know, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
