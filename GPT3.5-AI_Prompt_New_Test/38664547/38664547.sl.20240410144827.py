Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: The input data consists of various words with the common pattern of starting with "that" followed by another word. The output column consistently removes the "that" prefix from the input words. This relationship suggests that the output is derived by simply removing the prefix "that" from each input word. The input words seem to serve as descriptors or qualifiers for the output word, with the prefix "that" indicating a connection or relationship between the two. Overall, the input-output relationship appears to involve a transformation where the prefix "that" is removed to generate the output word., and input as ['thatensures'] output is ensures, input as ['thatwill'] output is will, input as ['thathave'] output is have, input as ['knowthat'] output is know, input as ['that'] output is that, input as ['mouse'] output is mouse, input as ['knowthat'] output is know, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
