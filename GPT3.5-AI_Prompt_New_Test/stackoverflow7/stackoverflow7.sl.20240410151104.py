Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Input Column 1 Summary:
- The input column contains two items, with the first item labeled as "Item 1 AQ-S810W-2AVDF" and the second item as "AQ-S810W-2AVDF."

Input Column 2 Summary:
- The input column contains two items, with the first item labeled as "Item 2 AQ-230A-1DUQ" and the second item as "AQ-230A."

Output Column Summary:
- The output column contains two items, with the first item labeled as "Item 1" and the second item as "-1DUQ."

Relationship between Input and Output:
- The input column data includes detailed descriptions of the items, such as model numbers and additional information. The output column simplifies this information by only displaying the item name and a portion of the additional information. The output column seems to focus on providing a concise label for each item, possibly for easier reference or identification., and input as ['Item 1 AQ-S810W-2AVDF', 'AQ-S810W-2AVDF'] output is Item 1, input as ['Item 2 AQ-230A-1DUQ', 'AQ-230A'] output is Item 2 -1DUQ, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.

    # Process each element to extract the desired output

            output = 'Item 1'
        elif 'Item 2' in item:
            output = 'Item 2 -1DUQ'
    
    return output

# Test cases
