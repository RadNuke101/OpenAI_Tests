Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Summary for Input Column 1:
- The input column contains two items: 'Item 1 AQ-S810W-2AVDF' and 'Item 2 AQ-230A-1DUQ'.
- Both items have a similar format with a name followed by a code.

Summary for Output Column:
- The output column contains the extracted codes from the input items: 'AQ-S810W-2AVDF' and 'AQ-230A-1DUQ'.
- The output column shows that only the code part of the input items was extracted.

Relationship between Input and Output:
- The output column is derived from the input column by extracting the code part of each item.
- The output column provides a concise representation of the input items by focusing on the unique codes associated with each item.
- The relationship between the input and output is that the output simplifies the information provided in the input by isolating and highlighting the key identifying codes., and input as ['Item 1 AQ-S810W-2AVDF', 'AQ-S810W-2AVDF'] output is Item 1, input as ['Item 2 AQ-230A-1DUQ', 'AQ-230A'] output is Item 2 -1DUQ, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.

# Define the generated function
def generated_function(input_str):
    # Split the input string into item name and code
    item_name, code = input_str.split(' ', 1)
    # Return the extracted code
    return code

# Test cases
print(generated_function('Item 1 AQ-S810W-2AVDF'))  # Output: AQ-S810W-2AVDF
print(generated_function('Item 2 AQ-230A-1DUQ'))  # Output: AQ-230A-1DUQ
print(generated_function("Item 1 AQ-S810W-2AVDF", "AQ-S810W-2AVDF"))  ## Output: Item 1
print(generated_function("Item 2 AQ-230A-1DUQ", "AQ-230A"))  ## Output: Item 2 -1DUQ
