Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Summary for Input Column Data:
- The input data consists of sentences with instructions to delete certain words in the area and keep other parts.

Summary for Output Column Data:
- The output column data shows the result of following the instructions given in the input, where the specified words are deleted and the desired parts are kept.

Relationship between Input and Output:
- The input column data provides specific instructions on which words to delete and which parts to keep, while the output column data reflects the result of following those instructions. The relationship between the two is that the output is a modified version of the input based on the provided instructions., and input as ['This is a line. /delete words in the area /keep this part'] output is This is a line. keep this part, input as ['/delete words in the area /'] output is , , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
