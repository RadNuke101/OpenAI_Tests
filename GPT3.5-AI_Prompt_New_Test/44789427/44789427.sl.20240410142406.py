Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Summary for Input Column 1 (Date Ranges):
- The input column contains date ranges in the format of MM/DD/YY-MM/DD/YY or MM/DD/YYYY-MM/DD/YYYY.
- The dates in the input column are formatted differently, with some having leading zeros and some not.
- The input column represents a range of dates, with the start date followed by a hyphen and then the end date.

Summary for Input Column 2 (Numbers):
- The input column contains single-digit numbers.

Summary for Output Column (Selected Date):
- The output column represents a single date selected from the date range in Input Column 1.
- The selected date is either the start date or the end date of the range, based on the corresponding number in Input Column 2.

Relationship between Input and Output:
- The output date is determined by the number in Input Column 2, with '1' corresponding to the start date and '2' corresponding to the end date of the date range in Input Column 1.
- The input date range provides the context for selecting the output date, with the number indicating which date to choose.
- The relationship between the input and output is straightforward and deterministic, as the output date is directly linked to the input date range and the specified number., and input as ['1/17/16-1/18/17', '1'] output is 1/17/16, input as ['1/17/16-1/18/17', '2'] output is 1/18/17, input as ['01/17/2016-01/18/2017', '1'] output is 01/17/2016, input as ['01/17/2016-01/18/2017', '2'] output is 01/18/2017, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
