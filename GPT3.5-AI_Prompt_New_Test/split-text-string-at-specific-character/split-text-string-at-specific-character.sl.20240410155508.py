'''
Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Summary for Input Column 1:
- The input column 1 contains dates in the format MMDDYY.
- The data in this column seems to represent dates related to assignments or costs.

Summary for Input Column 2:
- The input column 2 contains text data.
- The data in this column seems to represent the nature of the file, such as assignment or cost.

Summary for Output Column:
- The output column contains a combination of the date and file nature from the input columns.
- The output seems to be a formatted representation of the input data, with the date followed by an underscore and the file nature.

Relationship between Input and Output:
- The output column combines information from both input columns to create a new format.
- The date from input column 1 is used as the first part of the output, followed by an underscore, and then the text from input column 2.
- This relationship suggests that the output is a formatted representation of the input data, combining the date and file nature into a single string., and input as ['011016_assignment.xlsx', '1'] output is 011016, input as ['011016_assignment.xlsx', '2'] output is assignment.xlsx, input as ['030116_cost.xlsx', '1'] output is 030116, input as ['030116_cost.xlsx', '2'] output is cost.xlsx, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.

# Define the generated function
def generated_function(input_str, input_num):
    # Split the input string into date and file nature
    date, file_nature = input_str.split('_')
    
    # Check the input_num to determine the output
    if input_num == '1':
        return date
    elif input_num == '2':
        return file_nature

# Test cases
