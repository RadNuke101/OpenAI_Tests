Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: For the input column data:

1. ['011016_assignment.xlsx', '1']:
   - The first element is '011016' which seems to represent a date or a code.
   - The second element is '1' which could be a reference number or a category identifier.

2. ['011016_assignment.xlsx', '2']:
   - The first element is 'assignment.xlsx' which appears to be a file name.
   - The second element is '2' which could be a version number or a category identifier.

3. ['030116_cost.xlsx', '1']:
   - The first element is '030116' which seems to represent a date or a code.
   - The second element is '1' which could be a reference number or a category identifier.

4. ['030116_cost.xlsx', '2']:
   - The first element is 'cost.xlsx' which appears to be a file name.
   - The second element is '2' which could be a version number or a category identifier.

For the output column data:
- The output column seems to be a combination of the input elements, with the first element representing a date or code, and the second element representing a file name or category identifier.

Relationship between input and output:
- The input data seems to consist of a date or code followed by a file name or category identifier. The output combines these elements, possibly indicating a relationship between the date/code and the file name/category. This relationship could suggest that the input data is being processed or categorized based on the date/code and file name/category., and input as ['011016_assignment.xlsx', '1'] output is 011016, input as ['011016_assignment.xlsx', '2'] output is assignment.xlsx, input as ['030116_cost.xlsx', '1'] output is 030116, input as ['030116_cost.xlsx', '2'] output is cost.xlsx, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
