Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Summary for Input Column 1 (Names):
- The input column 1 contains names of individuals such as Traci Brown, Mary Hannan, and Linda Thomas.

Summary for Input Column 2 (Addresses):
- The input column 2 contains street addresses such as 1301 Robinson Court, 1195 Amethyst Drive, and 2479 North Bend Road.

Summary for Input Column 3 (Cities, States, Zip Codes):
- The input column 3 contains city, state, and zip code combinations such as Saginaw, MI 48607, Lansing, MI 48933, and Allen, KY 41601.

Summary for Output Column (Combined Address):
- The output column combines the name, street address, city, state, and zip code into a single formatted address for each individual.

Relationship between Input and Output:
- The input columns provide individual components of an address (name, street address, city, state, zip code) while the output column combines these components into a complete address for each person. The input data is used to construct a formatted address in the output, creating a clear relationship between the input information and the resulting output., and input as ['Traci Brown', '1301 Robinson Court', 'Saginaw, MI 48607'] output is Traci Brown/n1301 Robinson Court/nSaginaw, MI 48607, input as ['Mary Hannan', '1195 Amethyst Drive', 'Lansing, MI 48933'] output is Mary Hannan/n1195 Amethyst Drive/nLansing, MI 48933, input as ['Linda Thomas', '2479 North Bend Road', 'Allen, KY 41601'] output is Linda Thomas/n2479 North Bend Road/nAllen, KY 41601, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
