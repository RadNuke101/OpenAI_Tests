Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Summary for Input Column 1 (Names):
- The input column 1 consists of names such as Traci Brown, Mary Hannan, and Linda Thomas.

Summary for Input Column 2 (Addresses):
- The input column 2 consists of addresses like 1301 Robinson Court, 1195 Amethyst Drive, and 2479 North Bend Road.

Summary for Input Column 3 (Cities, States, ZIP Codes):
- The input column 3 consists of city, state, and ZIP code combinations like Saginaw, MI 48607, Lansing, MI 48933, and Allen, KY 41601.

Summary for Output Column (Combined Information):
- The output column combines the input data into a single format with the name, address, city, state, and ZIP code separated by "/n".
- The output provides a structured format for the input data, making it easier to read and understand.
- The output column serves as a summary of the relationship between the input columns, organizing the information in a clear and concise manner., and input as ['Traci Brown', '1301 Robinson Court', 'Saginaw, MI 48607'] output is Traci Brown/n1301 Robinson Court/nSaginaw, MI 48607, input as ['Mary Hannan', '1195 Amethyst Drive', 'Lansing, MI 48933'] output is Mary Hannan/n1195 Amethyst Drive/nLansing, MI 48933, input as ['Linda Thomas', '2479 North Bend Road', 'Allen, KY 41601'] output is Linda Thomas/n2479 North Bend Road/nAllen, KY 41601, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
