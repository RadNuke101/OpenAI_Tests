Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Summary for Input Column Data:
- The input column data consists of fruit names followed by a numerical value. The fruit names include apples, peaches, and pears.
- The numerical values seem to represent some quantity related to the fruits, but the exact meaning is not clear from the provided examples.

Summary for Output Column Data:
- The output column data consists of the fruit names extracted from the input column data.
- The output column includes the fruits apples, peaches, and pears based on the input examples provided.

Relationship between Input and Output:
- The output column data is derived from the input column data by extracting the fruit names.
- The output column seems to represent the primary fruit being referred to in each input example.
- The numerical values in the input column do not directly impact the output, as the focus is on the fruit names.
- The relationship between the input and output is that the output column displays the fruit name mentioned in each input example., and input as ['apples30', '7'] output is apples, input as ['peaches24', '8'] output is peaches, input as ['peaches0', '8'] output is peaches, input as ['pears', '6'] output is pears, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
