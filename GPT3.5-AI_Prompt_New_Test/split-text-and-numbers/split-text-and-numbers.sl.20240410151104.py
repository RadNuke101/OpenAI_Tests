Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Summary for Input Column 1:
- The input column contains various fruits with numerical values attached to them.
- The fruits mentioned include apples, peaches, and pears.
- The numerical values seem to represent some quantity or attribute related to the fruits.

Summary for Input Column 2:
- The input column contains numerical values.
- The values are integers ranging from 6 to 8.

Summary for Output Column:
- The output column contains the names of fruits.
- The fruits mentioned include apples, peaches, and pears.
- The output seems to be derived from the input column data, possibly by selecting the fruit name.

Relationship between Input and Output:
- The output column seems to be derived from the input column 1 by selecting the fruit name and excluding the numerical values.
- The output column only includes the fruit names without any numerical values.
- The relationship between the input and output is that the output is a subset of the input, with the numerical values removed to focus only on the fruit names., and input as ['apples30', '7'] output is apples, input as ['peaches24', '8'] output is peaches, input as ['peaches0', '8'] output is peaches, input as ['pears', '6'] output is pears, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.

# Define the generated function

    # Split the input string into fruit and value
    input_list = input_str.split(',')
    fruit = input_list[0]
    
    # Remove any numerical values from the fruit name
    fruit_name = ''.join([i for i in fruit if not i.isdigit()])
    
    return fruit_name

# Test cases
