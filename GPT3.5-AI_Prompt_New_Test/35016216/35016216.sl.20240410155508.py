Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Summary for Input Column 1:
- The input column 1 contains a mix of values starting with either uppercase letters or lowercase letters, followed by a combination of letters and numbers. The values in this column do not follow a consistent pattern.

Summary for Input Column 2:
- The input column 2 contains a mix of values consisting of lowercase letters only. The values in this column do not follow a consistent pattern.

Summary for Output Column:
- The output column contains a mix of values that are either the same as the first value in input column 1 or the same as the second value in input column 2. There seems to be a relationship between the output value and the input values, where the output value is either the first or second value from the input columns.

Relationship between Input and Output:
- The output value seems to be determined by whether the first value in input column 1 matches the second value in input column 2. If there is a match, the output is the second value from input column 2. If there is no match, the output is the first value from input column 1. This relationship suggests that the output is based on a comparison between the two input values., and input as ['C0abc', 'def'] output is C0abc, input as ['aabc', 'def'] output is def, input as ['C0dd', 'qwe'] output is C0dd, input as ['dd', 'qwe'] output is qwe, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.

# Define the generated function
def generated_function(input1, input2):
    # Check if the first value in input column 1 matches the second value in input column 2
    if input1[0] == input2:
        return input2
    else:
        return input1

# Test cases
print(generated_function('C0abc', 'def'))
print(generated_function('aabc', 'def'))
print(generated_function('C0dd', 'qwe'))
print(generated_function('dd', 'qwe'))
