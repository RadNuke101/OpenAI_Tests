Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Input Column Summary:
- The first input column contains phrases with variations in the expression of numbers, such as using digits or spelling out the numbers.
- The second input column contains a different phrase with a similar variation in the expression of numbers.
- The third input column contains a phrase with a number expressed as digits.

Output Column Summary:
- The output column contains boolean values indicating whether the input phrase is true or false based on the expression of numbers.

Relationship Summary:
The output column evaluates the truthfulness of the input phrases based on the consistency in the expression of numbers. Phrases that use the same format for numbers throughout are considered true, while those with variations are considered false. The relationship between the input and output is based on the accuracy of numerical expression in the input phrases., and input as ['A bird in the hand is worth 2 in the bush.'] output is true, input as ['A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush.'] output is false, input as ['The 15 shortcuts you simply must know'] output is true, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
