Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Summary for Input Column Data:
- The input column data consists of phrases or sentences that contain various words and punctuation.
- The phrases or sentences may include numbers written out as words or as numerals.
- The input data is qualitative in nature and does not involve numerical values.

Summary for Output Column Data:
- The output column data consists of boolean values (true or false) based on the input data.
- The output indicates whether the input phrase or sentence follows a specific format or rule.
- The output column data is qualitative and binary in nature.

Relationship between Input and Output:
- The output is determined based on whether the input phrase or sentence follows a specific format or rule related to the use of numbers (written out as words or numerals).
- If the input contains numbers written out as words, the output is true. If the input contains numbers as numerals, the output is false.
- The relationship between input and output is based on the format of numbers used in the input data.
- The output serves as a validation check for the format of numbers in the input phrases or sentences., and input as ['A bird in the hand is worth 2 in the bush.'] output is true, input as ['A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush.'] output is false, input as ['The 15 shortcuts you simply must know'] output is true, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
