Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Summary for Input Column Data:
- The input column data consists of sentences or phrases with varying lengths and structures.
- The input data includes phrases related to birds, hands, bushes, shortcuts, and numbers.

Summary for Output Column Data:
- The output column data consists of boolean values (true or false) indicating whether the input sentence follows a specific pattern or rule.

Relationship between Input and Output:
- The output column evaluates whether the input sentence follows a specific pattern or rule related to the use of numbers in phrases.
- If the input sentence contains the phrase "worth 2," the output is true. If it contains "worth two," the output is false.
- The output column also evaluates whether the input sentence contains specific keywords related to shortcuts.
- The relationship between input and output is based on the presence or absence of certain words or phrases in the input data., and input as ['A bird in the hand is worth 2 in the bush.'] output is true, input as ['A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush.'] output is false, input as ['The 15 shortcuts you simply must know'] output is true, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
