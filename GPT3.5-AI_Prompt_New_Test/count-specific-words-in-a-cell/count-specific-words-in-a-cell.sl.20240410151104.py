Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Summary for Input Column Data:
- The first input column data consists of sentences containing the phrase 'fox'.
- The second input column data consists of sentences containing the letters 'ox'.
- The third input column data consists of sentences containing the word 'Fox'.

Summary for Output Column:
- The output column data shows the count of occurrences of the specified word or letters in each sentence.

Relationship between Input and Output:
- The output value represents the number of times the specified word or letters appear in each sentence from the input column data.
- In the first two cases, where the specified word 'fox' or letters 'ox' are present in the sentences, the output count is 2.
- In the third case, where the specified word 'Fox' is not present in the sentences, the output count is 0.
- The relationship between the input data and the output count is based on the presence or absence of the specified word or letters in the sentences., and input as ['The fox jumped over the fox', 'fox'] output is 2, input as ['The fox jumped over the fox', 'ox'] output is 2, input as ['The fox jumped over the fox', 'Fox'] output is 0, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.

    # Count the occurrences of the target string in the input string
    count = input_str.count(target_str)
    return count

# Test cases
print(generated_function('The fox jumped over the fox', 'fox')) # Output: 2
print(generated_function('The fox jumped over the fox', 'ox')) # Output: 2
print(generated_function('The fox jumped over the fox', 'Fox')) # Output: 0
print(generated_function("The fox jumped over the fox", "fox"))  ## Output: 2
print(generated_function("The fox jumped over the fox", "ox"))  ## Output: 2
print(generated_function("The fox jumped over the fox", "Fox"))  ## Output: 0
