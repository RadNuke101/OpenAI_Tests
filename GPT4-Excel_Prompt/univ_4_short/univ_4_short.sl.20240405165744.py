Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: return the second input, but if it contains "New York", replace it with "NY". If the second input does not have "USA" in it, again return a comma followed by a space, and then "USA", and input as ['University of Pennsylvania', 'Phialdelphia, PA, USA'] output is Phialdelphia, PA, USA, input as ['UCLA', 'Los Angeles, CA'] output is Los Angeles, CA, USA, input as ['Cornell University', 'Ithaca, New York, USA'] output is Ithaca, NY, USA, input as ['Penn', 'Philadelphia, PA, USA'] output is Philadelphia, PA, USA, input as ['University of Maryland College Park', 'College Park, MD'] output is College Park, MD, USA, input as ['University of Michigan', 'Ann Arbor, MI, USA'] output is Ann Arbor, MI, USA, input as ['Columbia University', 'New York, NY, USA'] output is New York, NY, USA, input as ['NYU', 'New York, New York, USA'] output is New York, NY, USA, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
