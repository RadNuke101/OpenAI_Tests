Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: return 1 plus the number of "/n" present in inputted expression, and input as ['one'] output is 1, input as ['one/ntwo'] output is 2, input as ['one/ntwo/nthree'] output is 3, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.

    # Initialize the count to 1 since we add 1 to the number of "/n" found
    count = 1
    # Iterate through each argument provided
    for arg in args:
        # Count the occurrences of "/n" in the current argument and add to count
        count += arg.count("/n")
