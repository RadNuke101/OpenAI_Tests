Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: delete "miles" from input, and input as ['736 miles'] output is 736, input as ['1255 miles'] output is 1255, input as ['1221 miles'] output is 1221, input as ['790 miles'] output is 790, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.

def generated_function(input_string):
    # Remove the word "miles" from the input string and strip any leading or trailing spaces
    output_string = input_string.replace("miles", "").strip()
    return output_string

# Test cases
result1 = generated_function('736 miles')
result2 = generated_function('1255 miles')
result3 = generated_function('1221 miles')
result4 = generated_function('790 miles')

# The results can be printed or used further in the code as needed
print(generated_function("736 miles"))  ## Output: 736
print(generated_function("1255 miles"))  ## Output: 1255
print(generated_function("1221 miles"))  ## Output: 1221
print(generated_function("790 miles"))  ## Output: 790
