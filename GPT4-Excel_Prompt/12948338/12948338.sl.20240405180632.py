Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: return count of the phrase (second column) in expression (first column), and input as ['An example string with _username in it RT _AwesomeUser says _username is awesome', 'username'] output is 2, input as ['An example string with _username in it RT _AwesomeUser says _username is awesome', 'AwesomeUser'] output is 1, input as ['An _example string with _example in it is awesome _example', 'example'] output is 3, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.

def generated_function(expression, phrase):

    return expression.count(phrase)

# Test cases
print(generated_function('An example string with _username in it RT _AwesomeUser says _username is awesome', 'username'))  # Expected output: 2
print(generated_function('An example string with _username in it RT _AwesomeUser says _username is awesome', 'AwesomeUser'))  # Expected output: 1
print(generated_function('An _example string with _example in it is awesome _example', 'example'))  # Expected output: 3
print(generated_function("An example string with _username in it RT _AwesomeUser says _username is awesome", "username"))  ## Output: 2
print(generated_function("An example string with _username in it RT _AwesomeUser says _username is awesome", "AwesomeUser"))  ## Output: 1
print(generated_function("An _example string with _example in it is awesome _example", "example"))  ## Output: 3
