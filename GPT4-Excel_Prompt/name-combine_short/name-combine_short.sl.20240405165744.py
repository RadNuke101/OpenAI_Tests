'''
Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: return first input followed by a space, and then the second input, and input as ['Launa', 'Withers'] output is Launa Withers, input as ['Lakenya', 'Edison'] output is Lakenya Edison, input as ['Brendan', 'Hage'] output is Brendan Hage, input as ['Bradford', 'Lango'] output is Bradford Lango, input as ['Rudolf', 'Akiyama'] output is Rudolf Akiyama, input as ['Lara', 'Constable'] output is Lara Constable, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.

# Define the function as specified
def generated_function(first_name, last_name):
    # Concatenate the first input, a space, and the second input
    return first_name + " " + last_name

# Test cases as per the prompt
generated_function('Launa', 'Withers')
generated_function('Lakenya', 'Edison')
generated_function('Brendan', 'Hage')
generated_function('Bradford', 'Lango')
generated_function('Rudolf', 'Akiyama')
generated_function('Lara', 'Constable')
print(generated_function("Launa", "Withers"))  ## Output: Launa Withers
print(generated_function("Lakenya", "Edison"))  ## Output: Lakenya Edison
print(generated_function("Brendan", "Hage"))  ## Output: Brendan Hage
print(generated_function("Bradford", "Lango"))  ## Output: Bradford Lango
print(generated_function("Rudolf", "Akiyama"))  ## Output: Rudolf Akiyama
print(generated_function("Lara", "Constable"))  ## Output: Lara Constable
