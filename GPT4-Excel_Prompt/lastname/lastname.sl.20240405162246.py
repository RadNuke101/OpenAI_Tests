'''
Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: return the second word of the inputted phrase, and input as ['Nancy FreeHafer'] output is FreeHafer, input as ['Andrew Cencici'] output is Cencici, input as ['Jan Kotas'] output is Kotas, input as ['Mariya Sergienko'] output is Sergienko, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.

def generated_function(phrase):

    else:
        return ""  # Return an empty string if there's no second word

print(generated_function("Jan Kotas"))  ## Output: Kotas
print(generated_function("Mariya Sergienko"))  ## Output: Sergienko
