'''
Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: return expression after the space after the "=" sign, and input as ['Name= ABC Retailers'] output is ABC Retailers, input as [' ame= XYZ Suppliers'] output is XYZ Suppliers, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.

def generated_function(input_string):
    # Splitting the input string based on the "=" sign and taking the part after the "=" sign.
    # The strip() function is used to remove any leading or trailing spaces.
    return input_string.split("=", 1)[1].strip()

# Test cases
output1 = generated_function('Name= ABC Retailers')
output2 = generated_function(' ame= XYZ Suppliers')

# The outputs can be checked with print statements or used further as per requirement.
print(generated_function("Name= ABC Retailers"))  ## Output: ABC Retailers
print(generated_function(" ame= XYZ Suppliers"))  ## Output: XYZ Suppliers
