'''
Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: return everything before the "_" in the second input, and input as ['ann chang', 'achang_maaker.com'] output is achang, input as ['bobby smith', 'bobt_sphynx.uk.co'] output is bobt, input as ['art lennox', 'art.lennox_svxn.com'] output is art.lennox, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.

def generated_function(name, email):
    """
    This function takes two inputs: a name and an email. It returns the part of the email
    that is before the underscore ("_").
    
    Parameters:
    - name (str): The name of the person (not used in the current logic).
    - email (str): The email address from which the part before the "_" is extracted.
    
    Returns:
    - str: The part of the email before the "_".
