# Content: Given that given input as ['humpty dumpty'] output is 2, given input as ['humpty dumpty sat on a wall,'] output is 6, given input as ['couldnt put humpty together again.'] output is 5, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. Add the input and output statements to the comment section of the generated python code. Incorporate exception handling with proper try catch blocks to handle all types of input exceptions. The code should be clean to run at a command prompt without any non-code and include above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. Generated python code should have only executable statements and comments, nothng else.

# Input: 'humpty dumpty'
# Output: 2

# Input: 'humpty dumpty sat on a wall,'
# Output: 6

# Input: 'couldnt put humpty together again.'
# Output: 5

    try:
        words = input_str.split()
        return len(words)
    except AttributeError:
        return "Invalid input. Please provide a valid string."

# Test cases
print(count_words('humpty dumpty'))  # Output: 2
print(count_words('humpty dumpty sat on a wall,'))  # Output: 6
print(count_words('couldnt put humpty together again.'))  # Output: 5
