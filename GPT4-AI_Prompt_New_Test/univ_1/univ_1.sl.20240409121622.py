Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Input Column Summary:

The input data consists of two distinct columns, each containing information related to various universities and colleges across the United States. The first column lists the names of the institutions, which include a mix of full university names (e.g., "University of Pennsylvania"), abbreviations (e.g., "UCLA" for University of California, Los Angeles), and informal names (e.g., "Penn" as a shorthand for the University of Pennsylvania). The second column provides the geographical location of these institutions, formatted as city and state, with some entries also including the country ("USA") for clarity. The locations span a wide range of cities and states, indicating a diverse geographical distribution of these institutions across the country. The input data, therefore, combines institutional identity with their geographical context, offering a snapshot of higher education landscapes in the United States.

### Output Column Summary:

The output data consolidates the information from the two input columns into a single string per entry, effectively merging the name of the institution with its geographical location. This amalgamation is done by appending the location directly after the institution's name, separated by a comma. The output maintains the original formatting and naming conventions found in the input data, including the use of abbreviations, informal names, and the inclusion of "USA" for certain locations. By combining these elements, the output provides a concise yet comprehensive identification for each institution, encapsulating both its identity and its physical setting within the United States.

### Relationship Summary:

The relationship between the input and output data is characterized by a transformation process that merges two distinct pieces of information into a unified format. This process involves taking the name of an institution from the first input column and its geographical location from the second input column, then combining them into a single, coherent string that serves as the output. This transformation is consistent across all entries, ensuring that each institution's identity is directly linked to its geographical context in a standardized manner. The output thus serves as a more complete reference for each institution, facilitating easier recognition and understanding of its geographical placement within the broader landscape of higher education in the United States., and input as ['University of Pennsylvania', 'Phialdelphia, PA, USA'] output is University of Pennsylvania, Phialdelphia, PA, USA, input as ['UCLA', 'Los Angeles, CA'] output is UCLA, Los Angeles, CA, input as ['Cornell University', 'Ithaca, New York, USA'] output is Cornell University, Ithaca, New York, USA, input as ['Penn', 'Philadelphia, PA, USA'] output is Penn, Philadelphia, PA, USA, input as ['University of Maryland College Park', 'College Park, MD'] output is University of Maryland College Park, College Park, MD, input as ['University of Michigan', 'Ann Arbor, MI, USA'] output is University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA, input as ['UC Berkeley', 'Berkeley, CA'] output is UC Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, input as ['MIT', 'Cambridge, MA'] output is MIT, Cambridge, MA, input as ['Rice University', 'Houston, TX'] output is Rice University, Houston, TX, input as ['Yale University', 'New Haven, CT, USA'] output is Yale University, New Haven, CT, USA, input as ['Columbia University', 'New York, NY, USA'] output is Columbia University, New York, NY, USA, input as ['NYU', 'New York, New York, USA'] output is NYU, New York, New York, USA, input as ['UC Berkeley', 'Berkeley, CA'] output is UC Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, input as ['UIUC', 'Urbana, IL'] output is UIUC, Urbana, IL, input as ['Temple University', 'Philadelphia, PA'] output is Temple University, Philadelphia, PA, input as ['Harvard University', 'Cambridge, MA, USA'] output is Harvard University, Cambridge, MA, USA, input as ['University of Connecticut', 'Storrs, CT, USA'] output is University of Connecticut, Storrs, CT, USA, input as ['Drexel University', 'Philadelphia, PA'] output is Drexel University, Philadelphia, PA, input as ['New Haven University', 'New Haven, CT, USA'] output is New Haven University, New Haven, CT, USA, input as ['University of California, Santa Barbara', 'Santa Barbara, CA, USA'] output is University of California, Santa Barbara, Santa Barbara, CA, USA, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
