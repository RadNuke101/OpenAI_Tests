Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Summary of Input Column Data:

The input column data appears to consist of strings that combine numerical values with textual information. These strings vary in their structure, with some starting with a numerical value followed by text, while others incorporate the numerical value within or at the end of the textual content. The textual content itself varies widely, including names, actions, or objects, indicating a diverse range of topics or contexts. The presence of numerical values suggests that these strings could represent transactions, identifications, quantities, or other scenarios where numbers and text are commonly combined.

### Summary of Output Column Data:

The output column data retains only the textual part of the input strings, systematically removing the numerical values. This process results in purely textual strings that focus on the qualitative aspects of the input data, such as names, descriptions, or actions, without the quantitative context provided by the numbers. The output data, therefore, emphasizes the narrative or descriptive elements of the input, stripping away the numerical information that might have provided a measure, identity, or valuation.

### Relationship Between Input and Output:

The transformation from input to output data demonstrates a clear relationship where the output is derived by extracting and isolating the textual content from the input, effectively discarding the numerical values. This process suggests an analytical focus on the qualitative aspects of the data, aiming to highlight or analyze the narrative, descriptive, or categorical elements without the influence of quantitative measures. The relationship indicates an underlying purpose or analysis that values the story, identity, or description contained within the strings over the numerical data that might have provided a different dimension of understanding or categorization. This could be particularly relevant in contexts where the meaning or significance is primarily derived from the textual content rather than the numerical values., and input as ['34653 jim mcdonald'] output is  jim mcdonald, input as ['price is 500'] output is  price is , input as ['100 apples'] output is  apples, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
