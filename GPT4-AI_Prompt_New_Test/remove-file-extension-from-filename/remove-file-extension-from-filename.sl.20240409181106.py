Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Input Column Summary:

The input column consists of a list of filenames, each with a specific format that includes both the name of the file and its extension. These filenames are indicative of various types of documents or images, as suggested by their extensions (e.g., .jpg, .xls, .csv, .pdf). The names of the files themselves suggest a variety of contents, ranging from personal (e.g., 'happy.jpg') to professional (e.g., 'pivot table.xls', 'sales data.csv', 'invoice3001.xls.pdf'). The extensions indicate the file format, which could be an image file (.jpg), spreadsheet (.xls), comma-separated values file (.csv), or a PDF document (.pdf). The presence of multiple extensions in a single filename (e.g., 'invoice3001.xls.pdf') suggests that some files may have undergone conversion or have been saved in a different format from their original.

### Output Column Summary:

The output column extracts and presents the base name of each file from the input column, effectively removing the file extension(s). This process distills the filenames down to their essential identifiers or titles, stripping away the technical details related to file format. The output retains the meaningful part of each filename, which could represent the subject or content of the file (e.g., 'happy', 'pivot table', 'sales data', 'invoice3001'). This simplification process focuses on the semantic component of the filenames, disregarding their format and thus making the content more immediately recognizable and categorizable.

### Relationship Between Input and Output:

The relationship between the input and output columns is characterized by a transformation process that extracts the semantic essence of each filename, removing the file format extensions. This process reveals the underlying content or subject matter of each file without the need for the viewer to parse through or understand the implications of the file formats. The transformation from input to output serves to simplify and clarify the data, making it more accessible and immediately understandable. It highlights the content over the format, emphasizing what the files represent rather than how they are stored or formatted. This relationship underscores a focus on the qualitative aspects of the data, prioritizing content identification and categorization over technical details., and input as ['happy.jpg'] output is happy, input as ['pivot table.xls'] output is pivot table, input as ['sales data.csv'] output is sales data, input as ['invoice3001.xls.pdf'] output is invoice3001, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
