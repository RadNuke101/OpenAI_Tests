Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Summary of Input Column Data:

The input data consists of a collection of statements that express personal preferences towards certain fruits, specifically apples and bananas. These statements are structured in a way that clearly indicates a positive or negative sentiment towards the mentioned fruit. The first part of the input data contains explicit expressions of these sentiments, such as "I love apples" and "I hate bananas". The final part of the input data presents a single fruit without any accompanying sentiment, serving as a query or a keyword for which the sentiment is to be identified based on the previous statements.

### Summary of Output Column Data:

The output data provides a direct response to the query or keyword mentioned in the last part of the input data. It selects and presents the statement from the input that matches the queried fruit, effectively reflecting the sentiment towards that specific fruit as previously expressed. The output is thus a filtered expression of sentiment that directly corresponds to the query, showcasing the individual's preference regarding apples or bananas as per the input statements.

### Relationship Between Input and Output:

The relationship between the input and output data is characterized by a process of matching and filtering based on the keyword or query presented in the input. The input data serves a dual purpose: it establishes a set of sentiments towards certain fruits and then poses a query regarding one of these fruits. The output data then acts as a resolution to this query by filtering through the sentiments expressed in the input to find the one that matches the queried fruit. This process highlights a clear cause-and-effect relationship where the input data provides the context and the query, and the output data delivers the corresponding sentiment as the effect. The mechanism underlying this relationship is the identification of keywords in the query and matching them with the sentiments expressed towards those keywords in the earlier part of the input data. This demonstrates a qualitative analysis where the output is directly influenced by the specific content and structure of the input data., and input as ['I love apples', 'I hate bananas', 'banana'] output is I hate bananas, input as ['I love apples', 'I hate bananas', 'apple'] output is I love apples, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
