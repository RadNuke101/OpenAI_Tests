Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Summary of Input Column Data:

The input data consists of a collection of statements expressing personal preferences towards certain fruits, specifically apples and bananas, followed by a single word that seems to represent a fruit of interest. The statements are structured to either express a positive sentiment (e.g., "I love apples") or a negative sentiment (e.g., "I hate bananas") towards the mentioned fruit. The final element in the input data appears to be a keyword or trigger word, which is a fruit name without any accompanying sentiment. This structure suggests that the input data is designed to capture individual preferences about specific fruits and then query these preferences based on a particular fruit of interest.

### Summary of Output Column Data:

The output data directly corresponds to the input data's final element, the fruit of interest. It provides a response that matches the sentiment previously expressed towards the queried fruit. If the input data contains a statement of preference about the fruit of interest (e.g., "apple" or "banana"), the output is the complete statement that reflects this preference. This indicates that the output is generated by filtering the input statements based on the fruit of interest, effectively retrieving the sentiment associated with that fruit.

### Relationship Between Input and Output:

The relationship between the input and output data is characterized by a filtering or matching process. The input data serves two functions: it establishes a set of preferences regarding certain fruits, and it specifies a fruit of interest for which the sentiment is to be retrieved. The output data then reflects the sentiment associated with the fruit of interest, as previously stated in the input data. This process suggests a mechanism where the input data is scanned for a match with the fruit of interest, and the corresponding sentiment (love or hate) towards that fruit is then produced as the output. 

In summary, the input data captures both general preferences towards fruits and a specific query about one of those fruits, while the output data provides a direct response that reflects the sentiment associated with the queried fruit. This demonstrates a clear relationship of query and response, where the input data's structure allows for the extraction of specific sentiment-based information in response to a targeted query., and input as ['I love apples', 'I hate bananas', 'banana'] output is I hate bananas, input as ['I love apples', 'I hate bananas', 'apple'] output is I love apples, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
