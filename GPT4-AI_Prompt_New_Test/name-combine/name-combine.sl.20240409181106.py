Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Summary for Input Column Data:

The input data consists of two columns, each containing a list of first names and last names, respectively. The first names vary widely in origin and phonetic style, indicating a diverse set of individuals. Names like "Launa," "Lakenya," "Brendan," "Bradford," "Rudolf," and "Lara" suggest a mix of cultural backgrounds. Similarly, the last names such as "Withers," "Edison," "Hage," "Lango," "Akiyama," and "Constable" also display a variety of origins, ranging from English to Japanese. This diversity in both columns suggests that the dataset might be representing individuals from various ethnic and cultural backgrounds, without any apparent pattern or grouping based on the names alone.

### Summary for Output Column Data:

The output data combines the first and last names from the input columns into full names, presented in a standard "FirstName LastName" format. This transformation from separate entities into a single string per individual allows for a more natural and human-readable representation of each person's name. The output maintains the diversity observed in the input columns, reflecting a wide range of cultural backgrounds. The process of combining the names does not alter the individual characteristics of each name but presents them in a format that is commonly used in formal and informal contexts, making the data more applicable for scenarios where full names are required.

### Relationship Summary:

The relationship between the input and output data is a straightforward concatenation process, where the first and last names are merged to form complete names. This transformation is consistent across all entries, indicating a uniform approach to generating the output. The primary purpose of this process seems to be the standardization of name representation, moving from a segmented to a unified format. This change enhances readability and usability of the data, especially in contexts where full names are preferred or required. The diversity of the names is preserved in the transformation, ensuring that the rich cultural information embedded in the names remains intact in the output., and input as ['Launa', 'Withers'] output is Launa Withers, input as ['Lakenya', 'Edison'] output is Lakenya Edison, input as ['Brendan', 'Hage'] output is Brendan Hage, input as ['Bradford', 'Lango'] output is Bradford Lango, input as ['Rudolf', 'Akiyama'] output is Rudolf Akiyama, input as ['Lara', 'Constable'] output is Lara Constable, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
