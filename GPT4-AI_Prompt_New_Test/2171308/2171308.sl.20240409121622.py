Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Input Column Summary:

The input column consists of full names of individuals, each entry formatted as a string containing a first name followed by a last name, separated by a space. Each name in the input column represents a unique individual, identified by their given name (first name) and their family name (surname or last name). The data is qualitative, focusing on the nominal aspect of the names, without implying any quantitative value or order. The names vary in length and cultural origin, reflecting a diversity in the dataset. The input data is structured in a way that each entry clearly distinguishes between the first and last names, which is crucial for the transformation process applied to generate the output.

### Output Column Summary:

The output column contains transformed versions of the input names, each formatted as an initial derived from the first name followed by the full last name, separated by a space. The transformation process involves abbreviating the first name to its initial (the first letter of the first name) and retaining the last name in its entirety. This process results in a standardized format that simplifies the names while preserving a level of individual identification through the unique combination of the initial and the last name. The output is also qualitative data, maintaining the nominal nature of the input but in a more condensed form. The output data retains the essential identifying information (the last name) while abbreviating the given name to ensure a uniform, concise representation of each individual's name.

### Relationship Summary:

The relationship between the input and output columns is defined by a systematic transformation process that abbreviates the first name to its initial while keeping the last name unchanged. This process simplifies the representation of names, making them more concise and standardized across the dataset. The transformation retains the essential identifying information (the last name) and a hint of the personal identifier (the initial of the first name), ensuring that each output entry remains uniquely linked to its corresponding input entry. The relationship underscores a method of data simplification and standardization, which could be particularly useful in contexts where space is limited or where quick, easy identification of individuals by name is required without the need for full first names. This transformation could be applied in various data processing, summarization, or visualization tasks where maintaining a balance between brevity and identification is crucial., and input as ['John Doe'] output is J Doe, input as ['Mayur Naik'] output is M Naik, input as ['Nimit Singh'] output is N Singh, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
