Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Summary for Input Column Data:

The input data consists of strings that represent movie titles. These strings are characterized by irregular spacing, either at the beginning, within, or at the end of the titles. The presence of extra spaces suggests a lack of standardization in how the movie titles are formatted. The titles themselves are recognizable and popular, indicating that the data might be drawn from a well-known source or are intended to represent a selection of notable films. The variability in spacing within and around the titles suggests that the data might originate from a source where formatting was not a primary concern or from user-generated content where inconsistencies are common.

### Summary for Output Column Data:

The output data retains the original movie titles from the input data but with all extraneous spaces removed. Each title is presented in a clean, standardized format, with single spaces between words and no leading or trailing spaces. This transformation indicates a cleaning or preprocessing step designed to standardize the format of the movie titles, making them more readable and easier to work with in subsequent analyses or applications. The output data reflects a successful effort to normalize textual data, which is a common requirement in data processing tasks, especially when dealing with strings or textual inputs.

### Relationship Between Input and Output:

The relationship between the input and output data is characterized by a cleaning or normalization process, where the goal is to remove unnecessary spaces from the movie titles. This process does not alter the essential content of the data (i.e., the movie titles themselves) but rather improves its format. This transformation is crucial for tasks that require standardized input, such as database entry, textual analysis, or any application where consistency in data presentation is important. The process demonstrates a common step in data preprocessing, highlighting the importance of preparing qualitative data in a way that enhances its usability and reliability for further analysis or application development., and input as ['  The shawshank'] output is The shawshank, input as ['The    godfather'] output is The godfather, input as ['    pulp   fiction'] output is pulp fiction, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
