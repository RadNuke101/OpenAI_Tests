Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Input Column Summary:

The input data consists of strings that represent distances in miles. Each entry in the column follows a consistent format, comprising a numerical value followed by the word "miles". The numerical part varies across entries, indicating different distances. The data is qualitative in nature, as it represents textual descriptions of distances.

### Output Column Summary:

The output data extracts and presents the numerical part of the input data as integers. This transformation converts the qualitative descriptions of distances into quantitative values, making it easier to perform numerical operations and analyses. The output retains the magnitude of the distance but discards the unit ("miles") present in the input, focusing solely on the numerical representation.

### Relationship Summary:

The relationship between the input and output data is a process of extraction and conversion. For each input string, the process involves identifying and extracting the numerical component that represents the distance in miles and then converting this component into an integer value for the output. This transformation effectively strips away the qualitative descriptor ("miles") and retains the quantitative essence (the distance value) of the input data. The process is consistent across all entries, ensuring that the output accurately reflects the distances specified in the input, albeit in a purely numerical form. This relationship allows for a straightforward interpretation of the distances without the textual description, facilitating numerical analysis and comparisons., and input as ['736 miles'] output is 736, input as ['1255 miles'] output is 1255, input as ['1221 miles'] output is 1221, input as ['790 miles'] output is 790, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
