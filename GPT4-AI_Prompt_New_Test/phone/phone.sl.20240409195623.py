Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Summary of Input Column Data:

The input data consists of strings formatted as three groups of three digits each, separated by hyphens (e.g., 'XXX-XXX-XXX'). Each string appears to represent a unique identifier or code, possibly following a specific pattern or structure. The first group of three digits varies across the inputs, suggesting a form of categorization or segmentation within the data set. The second and third groups also change but are not directly related to the output, hence their specific values might serve other purposes not identified in this summary. The input data, treated as qualitative, indicates a structured format that could be used for identification, categorization, or sorting purposes.

### Summary of Output Column Data:

The output data consists of the first group of three digits extracted from each input string. These outputs range from 118 to 981, indicating a wide but specific selection from the initial segment of the input data. The output directly correlates with the first segment of the input data, suggesting a relationship where the output serves as a key identifier or a significant categorization factor derived from the input.

### Relationship Summary Between Input and Output:

The relationship between the input and output data is straightforward: the output is directly extracted from the first segment of the input data. This relationship suggests that the most significant part of the input data, at least in terms of the output generated, is the first group of three digits. This could imply that the first segment holds primary importance in the context of the data's use or analysis, possibly serving as a main identifier, category, or sorting parameter. The remaining parts of the input data, while not directly influencing the output in this context, might hold additional information or serve secondary roles in a broader data structure or application. The extraction of the first segment as output underlines its significance over the other segments within each input string., and input as ['938-242-504'] output is 938, input as ['308-916-545'] output is 308, input as ['623-599-749'] output is 623, input as ['981-424-843'] output is 981, input as ['118-980-214'] output is 118, input as ['244-655-094'] output is 244, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
