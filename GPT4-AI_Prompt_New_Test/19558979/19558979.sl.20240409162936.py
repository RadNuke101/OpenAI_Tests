Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Input Column Summary:

The input data consists of two columns. The first column contains a repeated string value, "spreadsheet," across all rows. This string is constant and does not vary between the entries. The second column contains numeric strings that appear to increment by 1 starting from "1" and increasing with each subsequent row, indicating a sequence or an order. These numeric strings are treated as qualitative data, indicating their role is more about the position or sequence rather than a quantitative measure.

### Output Column Summary:

The output data is a single column that contains single characters extracted from the string "spreadsheet." Each row in the output column corresponds to a character from the string "spreadsheet," selected based on the numeric string in the second input column. The output starts with "s" when the second input column is "1" and follows the order of characters in the string "spreadsheet" as the numeric string increases. This pattern suggests a direct, positional relationship between the numeric string in the second input column and the character output.

### Relationship Summary:

The relationship between the input and the output columns is a straightforward mapping based on the position of characters within a fixed string ("spreadsheet") and the numeric string in the second input column. The numeric string serves as an index that specifies which character to extract from the fixed string. For example, a numeric string "1" corresponds to the first character of "spreadsheet," which is "s," a "2" corresponds to the second character, "p," and so on. This relationship indicates that the input effectively instructs which character to select from the predetermined string based on the position indicated by the second column's numeric string. The process is deterministic, with the output character directly dependent on the value provided in the second input column, showcasing a clear, positional mapping from input to output., and input as ['spreadsheet', '1'] output is s, input as ['spreadsheet', '2'] output is p, input as ['spreadsheet', '3'] output is r, input as ['spreadsheet', '4'] output is e, input as ['spreadsheet', '5'] output is a, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
