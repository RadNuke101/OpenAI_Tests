Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Input Column Summary:

The input data consists of two columns. The first column contains a repeated string value 'spreadsheet' for every entry, indicating a consistent textual input across all observations. The second column contains sequential numbers represented as strings, starting from '1' and increasing by 1 with each subsequent entry. These numbers are indicative of a positional reference, likely pointing to a specific character within the string mentioned in the first column.

### Output Column Summary:

The output data is a single column that contains individual characters extracted from the string 'spreadsheet'. Each output character corresponds directly to the position indicated by the number in the second input column. For instance, '1' corresponds to 's', '2' to 'p', '3' to 'r', and so forth, following the natural order of characters within the string 'spreadsheet'.

### Relationship Summary:

The relationship between the input and output columns is a direct mapping of character position within a predefined string ('spreadsheet') to the output character. The second column in the input data serves as an index that specifies which character to extract from the string provided in the first input column. This extraction process is consistent and predictable, with each numerical value in the second input column directly determining the character that appears in the output column. This setup illustrates a clear, functional relationship where the input effectively dictates the output through a positional reference within a static string., and input as ['spreadsheet', '1'] output is s, input as ['spreadsheet', '2'] output is p, input as ['spreadsheet', '3'] output is r, input as ['spreadsheet', '4'] output is e, input as ['spreadsheet', '5'] output is a, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
