Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Summary for Input Column Data

The input data consists of two columns. The first column contains a repeated string value, "spreadsheet," across all rows. This string is constant and does not vary from one row to another. The second column contains numerical strings, which increment by 1 starting from '1' in a sequential manner. Each row's second column value represents a position within the string mentioned in the first column. This sequential numbering suggests a direct relationship with the characters in the string "spreadsheet," where each number corresponds to a specific position in the string.

### Summary for Output Column Data

The output data is a single column that contains individual characters. These characters are extracted from the string "spreadsheet" based on the position indicated by the numerical value in the second input column. The output starts with 's' for '1', 'p' for '2', and so on, following the order of characters in the string "spreadsheet." Each row's output is a single character, and these characters are sequentially ordered as they appear in the input string "spreadsheet."

### Relationship Summary

The relationship between the input and output data is a direct mapping of position to character within a predefined string ("spreadsheet"). The second column in the input data specifies a position within the string mentioned in the first column. The output data then reflects the character found at that specified position. This process is consistent and predictable, demonstrating a clear, linear relationship between the position indicated by the input and the character output. Essentially, the input acts as an index to retrieve specific characters from the string "spreadsheet," and the output column displays these characters one by one, following the sequence dictated by the input column's numerical values., and input as ['spreadsheet', '1'] output is s, input as ['spreadsheet', '2'] output is p, input as ['spreadsheet', '3'] output is r, input as ['spreadsheet', '4'] output is e, input as ['spreadsheet', '5'] output is a, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
