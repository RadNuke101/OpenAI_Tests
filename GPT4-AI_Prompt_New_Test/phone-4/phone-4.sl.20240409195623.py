Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: The relationship between the input and output data can be summarized as follows:

**Input Data Summary:**
- The input data consists of strings formatted as three groups of three digits each, separated by hyphens (e.g., 'XXX-XXX-XXX').
- Each group of digits ranges from 000 to 999, without any leading zeros in the representation.
- The input data appears to represent a structured format, possibly mimicking a numerical or identification code system.

**Output Data Summary:**
- The output data retains the same numerical values as the input data but alters the format by replacing hyphens ('-') with periods ('.').
- The transformation results in a format that resembles a more globally recognized numerical or decimal representation (e.g., 'XXX.XXX.XXX').
- The output maintains the grouping of three digits but changes the delimiter, suggesting a stylistic or regional preference for representing such data.

**Relationship Summary:**
- The transformation from input to output data is purely stylistic, involving the substitution of separators between digit groups from hyphens to periods.
- There is no alteration in the order or value of the digits themselves, indicating that the process is not quantitative but rather a format conversion.
- This conversion could be relevant in contexts where the representation of numerical or coded data needs to adhere to specific formatting standards, such as in international communications, software data entry requirements, or document formatting preferences.
- The consistent structure before and after the transformation suggests that the data retains its original meaning or value, with the change only affecting its visual or textual representation.

In summary, the relationship between the input and output data demonstrates a straightforward format conversion process, emphasizing the importance of adherence to specific presentation standards without altering the underlying data's value or significance., and input as ['938-242-504'] output is 938.242.504, input as ['308-916-545'] output is 308.916.545, input as ['623-599-749'] output is 623.599.749, input as ['981-424-843'] output is 981.424.843, input as ['118-980-214'] output is 118.980.214, input as ['244-655-094'] output is 244.655.094, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
