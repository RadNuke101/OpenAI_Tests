Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Summary of Input Column Data:

The input data consists of strings that contain textual content with specific commands embedded within them. These commands include directives like "/delete" which signifies the beginning of a section that should be removed from the text, and "/keep" which could indicate the end of the deletion command or the start of a section that should be explicitly retained. The text outside these commands is considered regular content that might be subject to deletion based on the presence and positioning of these commands. The input data varies in length and complexity, containing both plain text and command-driven instructions that dictate how the text should be manipulated or filtered.

### Summary of Output Column Data:

The output data represents the transformation of the input text based on the embedded commands. Specifically, sections of the text designated by "/delete" commands are removed, and the remaining text, including those parts explicitly marked to be kept or unaffected by deletion commands, is preserved. The output is a cleaner version of the input, stripped of the sections intended for removal. The transformation process respects the boundaries set by the commands, resulting in text that may be significantly shorter than the original or, in cases where deletion commands are absent or nullified, potentially unchanged.

### Relationship Between Input and Output:

The relationship between the input and output data is defined by the processing of embedded commands within the input text that dictate text manipulation, specifically deletion. The output is a direct consequence of interpreting and acting upon these commands, leading to a modified version of the input where certain sections are omitted as instructed. This process highlights a structured approach to text editing that relies on predefined commands to automate content filtering. The transformation from input to output demonstrates a clear cause-and-effect relationship, where the cause is the presence and specifics of the deletion commands, and the effect is the selective removal of text, resulting in a concise and potentially more relevant output., and input as ['This is a line. /delete words in the area /keep this part'] output is This is a line. keep this part, input as ['/delete words in the area /'] output is , , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
