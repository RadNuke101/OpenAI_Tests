Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Summary of Input Column Data

The input data consists of strings that contain textual content with specific directives embedded within them. These directives are marked by special keywords such as "/delete" and "/keep," which signal operations to be performed on the text. The "/delete" directive indicates that the words following it, up to a certain point or the next directive, are to be removed from the output. Conversely, the "/keep" directive indicates that the text following it should be retained in the output. The input data is qualitative, consisting of sentences or phrases that may include instructions for text manipulation. The presence of these directives within the input strings suggests that the input data is intended for processing according to the specified text operations, leading to a transformation of the original text based on the embedded instructions.

### Summary of Output Column Data

The output data consists of transformed strings that have been processed according to the directives specified in the input data. The processing involves deleting certain portions of the text and retaining others, as dictated by the "/delete" and "/keep" instructions, respectively. The output strings are the result of applying these text manipulation operations to the input strings, effectively filtering the original content to produce a new version of the text that complies with the given directives. The output is qualitative, focusing on the textual content that remains after the specified deletions and retentions have been executed. It represents a distilled version of the input, having undergone modifications to remove or preserve specific parts of the text as instructed.

### Relationship Between Input and Output

The relationship between the input and output data is characterized by a transformation process guided by embedded directives within the input text. This process involves selectively deleting and keeping portions of the text to generate a modified version of the original content. The directives within the input serve as instructions for how the text should be manipulated, dictating which parts of the text are to be removed and which are to be retained in the final output. The output is directly derived from the input by applying these instructions, resulting in a new version of the text that aligns with the specified criteria for deletion and retention. This transformation process highlights a clear cause-and-effect relationship between the input directives and the resulting output text, with the input serving as a template for generating the output through specified text manipulation operations., and input as ['This is a line. /delete words in the area /keep this part'] output is This is a line. keep this part, input as ['/delete words in the area /'] output is , , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
