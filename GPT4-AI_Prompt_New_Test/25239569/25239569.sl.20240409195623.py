Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Summary of Input Column Data

The input data consists of strings that appear to represent advertising or marketing campaign identifiers, each containing several components that describe various attributes of the campaigns. These components are separated by underscores and include abbreviations and codes that likely stand for specific campaign characteristics such as the campaign type, size format (e.g., 728x90, 336x280), pricing model (CPM - Cost Per Mille), and other targeting or strategic identifiers (e.g., STD, NRT, DCK). The abbreviations such as "BAN" might refer to the format (e.g., banner), while others like "BRD", "LDS", and "DRS" seem to indicate the campaign's objective or focus (e.g., Branding, Leads, Direct Response). The structure of these identifiers suggests a standardized naming convention used to categorize and describe the key aspects of each campaign in a compact format.

### Summary of Output Column Data

The output data retains the structured format of the input data but with certain abbreviations expanded into more descriptive terms, enhancing clarity. For example, "BRD" is expanded to "Branding", "LDS" to "Leads", and "DRS" to "Direct Response", making the campaign objectives more immediately understandable. The expansion of abbreviations into full words does not alter the overall structure or the other components of the identifiers, which means that the essential information about the campaign (such as format size, pricing model, and other strategic identifiers) remains intact. This transformation suggests an effort to maintain the detailed categorization of the campaigns while making the descriptions more accessible to those who may not be familiar with the original abbreviations.

### Relationship Between Input and Output

The relationship between the input and output data is a process of clarification and expansion of specific abbreviations within the campaign identifiers. This process preserves the original information's integrity while making the campaign objectives more transparent and easier to understand. The transformation appears to be rule-based, focusing on expanding only certain abbreviations related to campaign objectives or focuses, without altering other elements of the identifiers. This approach suggests a balance between maintaining a compact, standardized naming convention and enhancing readability and comprehension for broader audiences. The output data, therefore, serves as a more descriptive version of the input data, facilitating better communication of the campaign characteristics without sacrificing the detail and specificity provided by the original format., and input as ['Adf_ROCLeader_BAN_728x90_CPM_STD _BRD _NRT_DCK'] output is Adf_ROCLeader_BAN_728x90_CPM_STD _Branding _NRT_DCK, input as ['MMC_ContextualLarRec_BAN_336x280_CPM_STD _LDS _RTG_DCK'] output is MMC_ContextualLarRec_BAN_336x280_CPM_STD _Leads _RTG_DCK, input as ['Adf_ROC_DLBD_728x90_CPM_STD_DRS_NRT_NOR_DCK'] output is Adf_ROC_DLBD_728x90_CPM_STD_Direct Response_NRT_NOR_DCK, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
