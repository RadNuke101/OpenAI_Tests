Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Input Column Summary:

The input data consists of strings that appear to represent advertising or digital campaign identifiers, each string structured in a specific format that includes multiple components separated by underscores. These components seem to denote various attributes of the campaigns such as the campaign name or identifier (e.g., "Adf_ROCLeader", "MMC_ContextualLarRec"), the format or type of the advertisement (e.g., "BAN"), dimensions of the ad (e.g., "728x90", "336x280"), pricing model (e.g., "CPM"), campaign type (e.g., "STD"), and additional attributes that could represent targeting or strategy identifiers (e.g., "BRD", "LDS", "NRT", "DCK"). The abbreviations within these strings are not immediately clear without context but suggest a standardized naming convention used within a specific advertising or marketing system.

### Output Column Summary:

The output data retains the structured format of the input data but with certain abbreviations expanded into more descriptive terms, enhancing clarity. For instance, "BRD" is expanded to "Branding", "LDS" to "Leads", and "DRS" to "Direct Response". This transformation suggests a process of decoding or translating the more cryptic, abbreviated input data into a format that is easier to understand, likely making it more accessible for human interpretation or for use in systems that require more descriptive identifiers. The output retains all other aspects of the input data unchanged, including campaign identifiers, ad formats, dimensions, pricing models, and other attributes, indicating that the primary transformation focuses on expanding specific abbreviations without altering the overall structure or the informational content of the identifiers.

### Relationship Summary:

The transformation from the input to the output data represents a process of clarification or decoding, where specific abbreviations within the campaign identifiers are expanded into their full descriptive forms. This process preserves the overall structure and informational content of the identifiers while enhancing readability and interpretability. The relationship between the input and output suggests a systematic approach to maintaining detailed campaign information in a compact form for internal use or data processing, while also allowing for an expanded, more understandable format for reporting, analysis, or external communication purposes. The consistent structure across both input and output indicates a standardized naming convention, with the transformation process serving to bridge the gap between compact, efficient data representation and user-friendly, descriptive information., and input as ['Adf_ROCLeader_BAN_728x90_CPM_STD _BRD _NRT_DCK'] output is Adf_ROCLeader_BAN_728x90_CPM_STD _Branding _NRT_DCK, input as ['MMC_ContextualLarRec_BAN_336x280_CPM_STD _LDS _RTG_DCK'] output is MMC_ContextualLarRec_BAN_336x280_CPM_STD _Leads _RTG_DCK, input as ['Adf_ROC_DLBD_728x90_CPM_STD_DRS_NRT_NOR_DCK'] output is Adf_ROC_DLBD_728x90_CPM_STD_Direct Response_NRT_NOR_DCK, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
