Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Summary of Input Column Data

The input data consists of strings that appear to be identifiers or codes for digital advertising placements or campaigns. Each string follows a structured format that includes several components separated by underscores. These components typically include an identifier for the campaign or ad format (e.g., "Adf_ROCLeader"), specifications about the ad size (e.g., "728x90"), the pricing model (e.g., "CPM"), and other attributes related to targeting, branding, or campaign objectives (e.g., "STD", "BRD", "NRT", "DCK"). The codes also contain abbreviations that seem to represent specific campaign features or goals, such as "BAN" for banner, "LDS" for leads, and "RTG" for targeting. The structure of these codes suggests a standardized naming convention used within a digital advertising system or for internal tracking purposes.

### Summary of Output Column Data

The output data retains the structured format of the input data but with modifications to certain abbreviations to make them more descriptive or readable. For example, "BRD" is expanded to "Branding", "LDS" to "Leads", and "DRS" to "Direct Response". These changes suggest an effort to clarify the meaning of the codes, making them more understandable to someone not familiar with the original abbreviations. The output retains all other aspects of the input data, including the campaign or ad format identifier, ad size, pricing model, and other attributes. The transformation from input to output appears to focus solely on expanding specific abbreviations to their full descriptive form without altering the overall structure or the information conveyed by the codes.

### Relationship Between Input and Output Data

The relationship between the input and output data is a process of clarification and standardization of specific abbreviations within the codes. The transformation process does not alter the fundamental information or structure of the codes but makes them more accessible by expanding certain abbreviations to their full form. This suggests that the purpose of the output data is to maintain the detailed information provided by the input codes while making them more understandable to a broader audience, possibly for reporting, documentation, or communication purposes where clarity is essential. The systematic nature of the transformation indicates that this process could be automated or followed as a standard procedure for converting internal codes into a more readable format for external or less technical stakeholders., and input as ['Adf_ROCLeader_BAN_728x90_CPM_STD _BRD _NRT_DCK'] output is Adf_ROCLeader_BAN_728x90_CPM_STD _Branding _NRT_DCK, input as ['MMC_ContextualLarRec_BAN_336x280_CPM_STD _LDS _RTG_DCK'] output is MMC_ContextualLarRec_BAN_336x280_CPM_STD _Leads _RTG_DCK, input as ['Adf_ROC_DLBD_728x90_CPM_STD_DRS_NRT_NOR_DCK'] output is Adf_ROC_DLBD_728x90_CPM_STD_Direct Response_NRT_NOR_DCK, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
