Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Summary of Input Column Data:

The input data consists of strings that are fragments of sentences or complete sentences. These strings appear to be derived from a well-known nursery rhyme, "Humpty Dumpty." Each string varies in length and complexity, ranging from simple phrases like "humpty dumpty" to more complex ones that include actions or consequences, such as "couldnt put humpty together again." The content of these strings involves characters, actions, and scenarios that are part of a narrative. The variation in the input data suggests a focus on different parts of a story or poem, highlighting specific moments or actions within the narrative.

### Summary of Output Column Data:

The output data is numerical, representing the count of words in each corresponding input string. The numbers range from 2 to 6, directly correlating with the length of the input strings. These outputs serve as a quantitative measure of the input data, providing a straightforward metric that quantifies the complexity or content volume of each input string.

### Relationship Between Input and Output:

The relationship between the input and output data is direct and functional. The output is determined by counting the number of words present in each input string, thus providing a numerical representation of the input's length or verbosity. This relationship is consistent across all data points, indicating a systematic approach to converting qualitative, textual data into quantitative, numerical data. The process highlights a method of analyzing text by quantifying its components, which can be particularly useful in contexts where the volume of content or the complexity of sentences is of interest. This method of analysis could be applied to various fields, including linguistics, content analysis, and education, where understanding the structure and complexity of language is crucial., and input as ['humpty dumpty'] output is 2, input as ['humpty dumpty sat on a wall,'] output is 6, input as ['couldnt put humpty together again.'] output is 5, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
