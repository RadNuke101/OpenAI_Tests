Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Input Column Summary:

The input data consists of strings that are fragments of sentences or complete sentences. These strings vary in length and complexity, ranging from simple phrases like "humpty dumpty" to more complex ones that include multiple words and punctuation, such as "humpty dumpty sat on a wall,". The content of the strings seems to be related to the nursery rhyme about Humpty Dumpty, suggesting a thematic connection across the data. The variation in the input data includes both the number of words and the inclusion of punctuation marks, which might play a role in the analysis or interpretation of the data.

### Output Column Summary:

The output data consists of integers that represent a count. Specifically, these numbers are 2, 6, and 5, corresponding to the different input strings provided. The output values are directly related to the content of the input strings, suggesting a quantitative measure of some characteristic of the input data. Given the context and the examples, it's reasonable to infer that the output values represent the count of words in each input string.

### Relationship Summary:

The relationship between the input and output data appears to be a direct correlation between the content of the input strings and the numerical values in the output. The output values are determined by counting the number of words in each input string. This is evident from the provided examples, where "humpty dumpty" consists of 2 words, resulting in an output of 2; "humpty dumpty sat on a wall," consists of 6 words, leading to an output of 6; and "couldnt put humpty together again." consists of 5 words, with an output of 5. The presence of punctuation does not affect the count, indicating that the analysis focuses solely on the number of words present in each input string, disregarding punctuation marks. This relationship showcases a straightforward word count operation applied to the input data to generate the output values., and input as ['humpty dumpty'] output is 2, input as ['humpty dumpty sat on a wall,'] output is 6, input as ['couldnt put humpty together again.'] output is 5, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
