Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Input Column Summary:

The input data consists of pairs of strings, each representing a type of fruit. These strings are qualitative in nature, indicating the name of the fruit. The data showcases a variety of fruits, including "apple," "orange," "peach," and "cherry." A key characteristic of the input data is the case sensitivity of the strings within each pair. Some pairs consist of identical strings (e.g., 'apple', 'apple'), while others include variations in capitalization (e.g., 'orange', 'Orange', 'cherry', 'cherrY'). This variation in case sensitivity is crucial for understanding the relationship between the input and the output.

### Output Column Summary:

The output data is binary (true or false), indicating a specific condition related to the input pairs. The condition being evaluated is whether the two strings in each pair are exactly the same, including case sensitivity. When both strings in a pair are identical in every aspect, including their case (e.g., 'apple', 'apple'), the output is true. Conversely, when there is any difference between the two strings, such as a difference in capitalization (e.g., 'orange', 'Orange'), the output is false.

### Relationship Summary:

The relationship between the input and the output is governed by the principle of string equality, with a specific emphasis on case sensitivity. The output is determined by whether the two strings in each input pair are exactly the same, not just in spelling but also in their use of uppercase and lowercase letters. This indicates a strict comparison method that does not normalize for case before comparing the strings. Thus, the output serves as an indicator of perfect string match, including case, within each pair of fruit names provided in the input. This relationship highlights the importance of precise string matching in determining the output, showcasing how even minor variations in string representation (such as capitalization) can alter the outcome of the comparison., and input as ['apple', 'apple'] output is true, input as ['orange', 'Orange'] output is false, input as ['peach', 'peach'] output is true, input as ['cherry', 'cherrY'] output is false, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
