Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Input Column Summary:

The input data consists of two primary components per row: a text string and a target word. The text string is a sentence or a sequence of sentences that may include various words, symbols, and special characters, including underscores (_). Within these strings, certain words are prefixed with an underscore (_), indicating a special emphasis or a specific context, such as usernames or keywords. The target word is a single word provided without any prefix, which the task seems to focus on identifying or relating to within the text string.

1. **Text String**: The text strings provided in the examples are complex, containing multiple elements such as words, spaces, special characters, and underscores. These strings mimic real-world text data, possibly from social media or similar platforms, where mentions or tags are commonly prefixed with underscores or other special characters.

2. **Target Word**: The target word is a simple string without any special formatting. It represents the keyword or term that needs to be identified or related to within the text string. The target word appears to play a crucial role in the task, serving as the focal point for analysis or processing.

### Output Column Summary:

The output data is numerical, representing a count. Specifically, it indicates the number of times the target word, when prefixed with an underscore, appears within the text string. This count is a direct measure of the relationship between the text string and the target word, quantifying the presence or relevance of the target word within the text context.

### Relationship Summary:

The relationship between the input and the output is based on the task of identifying and counting occurrences of a specific pattern within the text strings. This pattern is the target word prefixed with an underscore, suggesting a focus on special mentions or tags within the text. The process involves analyzing the text string to locate and count all instances where the target word, with the underscore prefix, appears.

1. **Pattern Identification**: The core of the relationship lies in identifying the specific pattern of the underscore followed by the target word within the text string. This requires parsing the text string, recognizing the underscore character, and matching the subsequent word against the target word.

2. **Counting Occurrences**: Once the pattern is identified, the task involves counting the number of times this pattern occurs within the text string. The output is a numerical value representing this count, directly linking the input text and target word to a quantifiable measure of their relationship.

In summary, the relationship between the input columns and the output column is a function of pattern recognition and counting, focusing on the specific context or emphasis indicated by the underscore prefix in the text strings. This relationship highlights the importance of the target word within the text, quantifying its presence in a specific, marked form., and input as ['An example string with _username in it RT _AwesomeUser says _username is awesome', 'username'] output is 2, input as ['An example string with _username in it RT _AwesomeUser says _username is awesome', 'AwesomeUser'] output is 1, input as ['An _example string with _example in it is awesome _example', 'example'] output is 3, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
