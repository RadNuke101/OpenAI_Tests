Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Input Column Summary:

The input data consists of single-word strings that appear to be combinations of smaller words or standalone words. These strings can be categorized into two main types: 

1. **Concatenated Words**: These are strings where two words are combined without any separator, such as 'thatensures', 'thatwill', 'thathave', and 'knowthat'. The first part of these concatenated words often includes words like 'that' or 'know', suggesting a pattern where a prefix is attached to a base word.

2. **Standalone Words**: These are strings that do not appear to be combinations of smaller words, such as 'that' and 'mouse'. These words are complete in themselves and do not follow the pattern of concatenation observed in the other category.

The input data, therefore, represents a mix of concatenated and standalone words, with a noticeable pattern in the concatenated words where specific prefixes are attached to other words to form a single string.

### Output Column Summary:

The output data consists of single-word strings that represent either a part of the input string or the entire input string itself. The outputs are:

1. **Derived Words**: For concatenated input words, the output is typically the word that follows the prefix in the input. For example, from 'thatensures', the output is 'ensures', and from 'knowthat', the output is 'know'. This suggests a rule where the output is derived by removing a specific prefix from the input.

2. **Identical Words**: For standalone input words, the output is identical to the input. For instance, 'that' remains 'that', and 'mouse' remains 'mouse'. This indicates that when the input does not follow the concatenation pattern, it is left unchanged in the output.

### Relationship Summary:

The relationship between the input and output data can be summarized as a process of deconstruction for concatenated words and preservation for standalone words. When the input is a concatenated word containing specific prefixes ('that', 'know'), the output is generated by removing these prefixes and preserving the base word. However, when the input is a standalone word, it is retained as-is in the output. This relationship suggests a rule-based transformation focused on identifying and removing specific prefixes from concatenated words while leaving standalone words unchanged., and input as ['thatensures'] output is ensures, input as ['thatwill'] output is will, input as ['thathave'] output is have, input as ['knowthat'] output is know, input as ['that'] output is that, input as ['mouse'] output is mouse, input as ['knowthat'] output is know, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
