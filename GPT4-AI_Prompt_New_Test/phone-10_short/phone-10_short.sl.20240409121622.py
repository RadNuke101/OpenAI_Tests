Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Input Column Summary:

The input data consists of a series of strings representing phone numbers. Each string begins with a '+' sign, followed by a country code of one to three digits. After the country code, there is a space, followed by a sequence of digits grouped into three parts. The first group appears to represent an area code or a similar subdivision, followed by two additional groups of digits. These groups are separated by hyphens. The format of the input strings can be summarized as follows: "+[CountryCode] [Group1]-[Group2]-[Group3]".

### Output Column Summary:

The output data retains the same essential information as the input data but reformats the presentation of the phone numbers. The country code still follows the '+' sign and is directly followed by the first group of digits, which is now enclosed in parentheses. The subsequent groups of digits are separated by hyphens, similar to the input. However, the introduction of parentheses around the first group after the country code is the key difference. The output format can be summarized as follows: "+[CountryCode] ([Group1]) [Group2]-[Group3]".

### Relationship Summary:

The transformation from the input to the output involves a reformatting of the phone numbers to enhance readability and possibly align with a more standardized or internationally recognized phone number format. The primary change is the encapsulation of the first group of digits (following the country code) within parentheses. This alteration does not affect the actual numerical content or the sequence of digits; it merely changes the presentation. This suggests that the purpose of the transformation is to adhere to a specific formatting preference, likely for consistency, clarity, or to meet the requirements of a particular system or standard for displaying phone numbers. The country code and the sequence of digits remain unchanged, ensuring that the essential information—the phone number itself—is preserved in both the input and output formats., and input as ['+106 769-858-438'] output is +106 (769) 858-438, input as ['+83 973-757-831'] output is +83 (973) 757-831, input as ['+62 647-787-775'] output is +62 (647) 787-775, input as ['+172 027-507-632'] output is +172 (027) 507-632, input as ['+72 001-050-856'] output is +72 (001) 050-856, input as ['+95 310-537-401'] output is +95 (310) 537-401, input as ['+6 775-969-238'] output is +6 (775) 969-238, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
