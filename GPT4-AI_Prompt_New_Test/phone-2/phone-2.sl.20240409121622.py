Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: To generate a summary for the input and output data based on the examples provided, let's first understand the structure of the data and then identify the relationship between the input and output.

### Input Data Structure:
The input data consists of strings formatted as 'XXX-XXX-XXX', where each 'X' represents a digit from 0 to 9. Each string is divided into three parts by hyphens. These parts do not seem to follow a specific numerical pattern or order based on the given examples. The input data is treated as qualitative, meaning we focus on the pattern or format rather than the numerical value of the numbers.

### Output Data Structure:
The output data consists of the last part (the third group of digits) of the input data, preserved exactly as it appears in the input, including leading zeros if present. This indicates that the output is directly extracted from a specific portion of the input data.

### Summary of Input Column Data:
- The input data is structured in a consistent format: three groups of three digits each, separated by hyphens.
- Each group of digits ranges from 000 to 999, but there is no apparent pattern or sequence to these numbers within the dataset provided.
- The input is treated qualitatively, focusing on the arrangement and extraction of data rather than the numerical value.

### Summary of Output Column Data:
- The output data consistently represents the third group of digits from the input data.
- It retains the exact format, including any leading zeros, indicating a direct extraction without numerical manipulation.
- The output is a subset of the input, specifically the last part of the structured input data.

### Relationship Between Input and Output:
The relationship between the input and output data is straightforward: the output is always the third group of digits from the input string. This extraction process treats the input as a source of qualitative data, focusing on the pattern of the data rather than its numerical value. The output's direct dependence on a specific portion of the input highlights a deterministic relationship where the output can be accurately predicted given the input format.

In summary, the relationship between the input and output is a simple extraction process, focusing on a specific segment of the input data. This process treats the data qualitatively, emphasizing the structure and format over numerical value., and input as ['938-242-504'] output is 504, input as ['308-916-545'] output is 545, input as ['623-599-749'] output is 749, input as ['981-424-843'] output is 843, input as ['118-980-214'] output is 214, input as ['244-655-094'] output is 094, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
