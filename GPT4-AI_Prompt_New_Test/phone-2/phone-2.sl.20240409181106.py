Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Summary of Input Column Data

The input data consists of strings formatted as three groups of three digits each, separated by hyphens (e.g., "XXX-XXX-XXX"). Each group within the input strings appears to be arbitrary and does not follow a discernible pattern based on the provided examples. The inputs are treated as qualitative data, meaning we focus on the composition and pattern of the data rather than numerical values or calculations. The structure is consistent across all examples, adhering to the format of having three distinct parts divided by hyphens.

### Summary of Output Column Data

The output data consists of three-digit numbers (or strings if leading zeros are considered significant, as in the case of "094"). These outputs are extracted from the input data, specifically representing the third group of digits in the input strings. The output values, like the input, are treated as qualitative data, focusing on their form and relation to the input rather than their numerical value.

### Relationship Between Input and Output

The relationship between the input and output data is straightforward: the output is directly derived from the input, being the last group of three digits in the input string. There is a one-to-one correspondence between each input and its output, with the output consistently representing the third segment of the input string, following the pattern "XXX-XXX-XXX" where "XXX" is the output extracted. This relationship indicates a rule or function where the input is processed to extract a specific portion (the last three digits) as the output, without any alteration to the digits themselves. This extraction process treats the data qualitatively, focusing on the structural position of the data within the input rather than any quantitative manipulation or calculation of the numbers themselves., and input as ['938-242-504'] output is 504, input as ['308-916-545'] output is 545, input as ['623-599-749'] output is 749, input as ['981-424-843'] output is 843, input as ['118-980-214'] output is 214, input as ['244-655-094'] output is 094, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
