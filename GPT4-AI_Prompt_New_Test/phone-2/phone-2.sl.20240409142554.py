Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: To generate a summary for the input column data and the output column based on the examples provided, let's first understand the structure of the input and the corresponding output.

### Input Column Data Summary:

The input data consists of strings formatted as three groups of three digits each, separated by hyphens (e.g., '938-242-504'). Each group within the input appears to be a set of arbitrary numbers with no immediately discernible pattern or sequence when comparing across different inputs. The inputs are qualitative in nature, as they seem to represent a specific code or identifier rather than a numerical value to be calculated or manipulated.

### Output Column Data Summary:

The output data consists of the last group of three digits from the input data (e.g., for an input of '938-242-504', the output is '504'). The output is also treated as qualitative data, as it represents a specific portion of the input data rather than a value derived from a mathematical operation. The leading zeros in outputs like '094' suggest that the formatting of the output as a three-digit group is important, maintaining the qualitative aspect of the data.

### Relationship Summary:

The relationship between the input and output data is straightforward: the output is directly extracted from the input, specifically being the last group of three digits of the input string. This relationship indicates that the input data contains within it the information necessary for determining the output, with the output serving as a subset of the input. The process of deriving the output from the input does not involve any transformation or manipulation of the data beyond the extraction of the specified portion. This relationship suggests a structural or hierarchical connection between the input and output, where the output can be seen as a detail or component of the larger input structure., and input as ['938-242-504'] output is 504, input as ['308-916-545'] output is 545, input as ['623-599-749'] output is 749, input as ['981-424-843'] output is 843, input as ['118-980-214'] output is 214, input as ['244-655-094'] output is 094, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
