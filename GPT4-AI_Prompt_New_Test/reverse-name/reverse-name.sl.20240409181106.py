Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Summary of Input Column Data:

The input data consists of two columns, each containing a list of names. The first column appears to contain given names, which are diverse and include both traditionally male and female names, suggesting a wide range of individuals without any apparent geographical or cultural limitation. Examples include "Launa," "Lakenya," "Brendan," "Bradford," "Rudolf," and "Lara." The second column seems to contain surnames, also diverse and indicative of a variety of cultural backgrounds, such as "Withers," "Edison," "Hage," "Lango," "Akiyama," and "Constable." This diversity in both columns suggests a dataset that is not restricted by any specific demographic or cultural criteria, focusing instead on a broad spectrum of names without any discernible pattern in terms of origin, gender, or ethnicity.

### Summary of Output Column Data:

The output data reorganizes the input data by swapping the positions of the given names and surnames, placing the surname before the given name. This transformation results in outputs like "Withers Launa," "Edison Lakenya," "Hage Brendan," "Lango Bradford," "Akiyama Rudolf," and "Constable Lara." The output maintains the diversity and range of the input data, merely altering the format in which the names are presented. This reorganization does not change the inherent characteristics of the names themselves but presents them in a format that might be more common in certain cultures or formal settings where the family name is typically given precedence over the given name.

### Summary of the Relationship Between Input and Output:

The relationship between the input and output data is a systematic reordering of the elements within each row, where the surname is moved to precede the given name. This transformation suggests a purposeful alteration to adapt to cultural, formal, or stylistic preferences that prioritize the family name over the individual's given name. The process does not discriminate based on the apparent gender, ethnicity, or origin of the names, applying uniformly across the dataset. This reordering could be particularly relevant in contexts where such a naming convention is standard or required, indicating a flexible approach to name presentation that can accommodate various cultural norms or organizational requirements., and input as ['Launa', 'Withers'] output is Withers Launa, input as ['Lakenya', 'Edison'] output is Edison Lakenya, input as ['Brendan', 'Hage'] output is Hage Brendan, input as ['Bradford', 'Lango'] output is Lango Bradford, input as ['Rudolf', 'Akiyama'] output is Akiyama Rudolf, input as ['Lara', 'Constable'] output is Constable Lara, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
