Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Input Column Summary:

The input data consists of two columns, each containing a series of first and last names. The first column appears to contain given names (e.g., "Launa," "Lakenya," "Brendan," "Bradford," "Rudolf," "Lara"), which are diverse in origin and suggest a wide range of cultural backgrounds. These names are personal identifiers typically given at birth or chosen later in life. The second column contains surnames (e.g., "Withers," "Edison," "Hage," "Lango," "Akiyama," "Constable"), which also display a variety of origins, indicating familial lineage or ancestral roots. Surnames often carry historical significance, denoting lineage, profession, or geographical origin. The combination of these two columns represents full names of individuals, showcasing a rich tapestry of cultural diversity.

### Output Column Summary:

The output data reorganizes the input names into a single column by reversing the order of the given name and surname, placing the surname before the given name (e.g., "Withers Launa," "Edison Lakenya," "Hage Brendan," etc.). This transformation maintains the integrity of each individual's name but alters the conventional Western naming order to a format that is more common in many Eastern cultures, where the family name precedes the given name. This reordering does not change the cultural significance or origin of the names but presents them in a format that emphasizes the familial or ancestral lineage first, followed by the individual's personal identifier.

### Relationship Summary:

The transformation from the input columns to the output column highlights a cultural naming convention shift, where the emphasis is placed on the surname rather than the given name. This shift does not alter the cultural diversity or the individual identity represented by each name but rather presents it in a different light, emphasizing the importance of familial ties and heritage. The process respects the individuality of each name while showcasing a universal practice of reordering names to align with different cultural norms or preferences. This reordering can be seen as a reflection of the global diversity of naming conventions and the fluidity with which personal identity can be represented., and input as ['Launa', 'Withers'] output is Withers Launa, input as ['Lakenya', 'Edison'] output is Edison Lakenya, input as ['Brendan', 'Hage'] output is Hage Brendan, input as ['Bradford', 'Lango'] output is Lango Bradford, input as ['Rudolf', 'Akiyama'] output is Akiyama Rudolf, input as ['Lara', 'Constable'] output is Constable Lara, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
