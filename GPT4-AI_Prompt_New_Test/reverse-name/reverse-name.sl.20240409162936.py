Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Input Column Data Summary:

The input data consists of two columns, each containing a list of names. The first column appears to contain given names, which are diverse and include both traditionally male and female names such as "Launa," "Lakenya," "Brendan," "Bradford," "Rudolf," and "Lara." These names vary in origin and are indicative of a multicultural dataset. The second column contains surnames such as "Withers," "Edison," "Hage," "Lango," "Akiyama," and "Constable." These surnames also reflect a variety of cultural backgrounds, suggesting that the dataset encompasses individuals from a wide range of ethnic and geographical origins. The names in both columns are unique in this dataset, with no repetitions observed.

### Output Column Data Summary:

The output data is a single column that combines the names from the two input columns, but in reversed order, placing the surname before the given name. This reversal creates outputs like "Withers Launa," "Edison Lakenya," "Hage Brendan," "Lango Bradford," "Akiyama Rudolf," and "Constable Lara." This format is commonly used in contexts where the emphasis is on the family name or in cultures where the family name traditionally precedes the given name. The output maintains the diversity and multicultural aspect of the input data, reflecting a wide range of backgrounds and origins.

### Relationship Summary:

The relationship between the input columns and the output column is a transformation that inverts the order of the given name and surname. This process does not alter the names themselves but changes their sequence to place the surname first, followed by the given name. This transformation could be relevant in contexts where the convention or preference is for the surname to precede the given name, such as in formal listings, academic citations, or in cultures with this naming convention. The operation maintains the integrity and diversity of the original data while adapting it to a different naming format., and input as ['Launa', 'Withers'] output is Withers Launa, input as ['Lakenya', 'Edison'] output is Edison Lakenya, input as ['Brendan', 'Hage'] output is Hage Brendan, input as ['Bradford', 'Lango'] output is Lango Bradford, input as ['Rudolf', 'Akiyama'] output is Akiyama Rudolf, input as ['Lara', 'Constable'] output is Constable Lara, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
