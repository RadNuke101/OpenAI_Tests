Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Summary for Input Column Data:

The input data consists of file paths in a string format, each leading to a specific file. These paths are structured hierarchically, starting from a root directory (e.g., 'home'), followed by subdirectories (e.g., 'Excel', 'user'), and culminating in a file name with an extension (e.g., 'Sheet1.xls'). The paths are diverse in terms of the directories they traverse but are consistent in leading to a '.xls' file, indicating that the files are Excel spreadsheets. The input data represents a qualitative dataset where each entry is a unique path to a specific Excel spreadsheet file located within a file system.

### Summary for Output Column Data:

The output data consists of the file names (with extensions) extracted from the input paths. Each output is a string representing just the file name, such as 'Sheet1.xls', stripped of its preceding path. The output data is qualitative, with each entry indicating the name of an Excel spreadsheet file. The consistency in the file extension ('.xls') across the output data suggests a uniform file type focus, specifically on Excel spreadsheet files.

### Relationship Summary between Input and Output:

The relationship between the input and output data is a process of extraction and simplification. The input data provides a detailed context of where each Excel spreadsheet file is located within a file system, including the directories traversed to reach the file. The output data, however, distills this information down to just the file name, removing all directory context. This transformation highlights a focus shift from the file's location within a hierarchy to its identity (name and type). The process effectively isolates the file name from its path, suggesting a scenario where the specific location of the file is less relevant than the file itself for the task at hand. This relationship underscores a common operation in data processing and file management tasks, where identifying or listing files by name, regardless of their location, is required., and input as ['home/Excel/Sheet1.xls'] output is Sheet1.xls, input as ['home/user/Sheet1.xls'] output is Sheet1.xls, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
