Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Summary for Input Column Data:

The input data consists of strings that represent file paths. These paths are structured, starting from a root directory (e.g., 'home') and potentially including multiple subdirectories (e.g., 'Excel', 'user'), leading to a specific file. The files in the provided examples are Excel spreadsheets, as indicated by the '.xls' file extension. The paths are absolute, providing a complete route from the base directory to the file's location. The variability in the paths suggests that the files can reside in different directories or subdirectories, but the constant element across all inputs is the presence of a file name with an '.xls' extension at the end of each path.

### Summary for Output Column Data:

The output data extracts and isolates the file name (including the file extension) from the given input paths. Regardless of the length or structure of the input path, the output consistently focuses on retrieving the last segment after the final slash ('/'), which is the file name. This process effectively strips away the directory and subdirectory information, leaving only the name of the Excel spreadsheet file. The output is uniform in format, showcasing only the file name with its extension, indicating a process of simplification and extraction from the input data.

### Relationship Summary between Input and Output:

The relationship between the input and output data is characterized by a process of extraction and simplification. The input data provides detailed file paths, which include directories and potentially multiple levels of subdirectories, leading to a specific file. The process applied to this input data focuses on isolating the file name from the entire path, effectively ignoring the directory structure and highlighting only the final component of the path, which is the file name with its extension.

This relationship indicates a transformation from a complex, structured input to a simplified, uniform output. The key operation in this transformation is the extraction of the file name from the path, which serves to standardize the output regardless of the input's complexity or the depth of the directory structure. The consistent focus on '.xls' files suggests a specific interest or application related to Excel spreadsheets, with the output providing a clear and concise reference to these files by name, facilitating easier identification or processing in subsequent steps., and input as ['home/Excel/Sheet1.xls'] output is Sheet1.xls, input as ['home/user/Sheet1.xls'] output is Sheet1.xls, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
