Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Summary for Input Column Data:

The input data consists of file paths, each leading to an Excel file (.xls format). These paths are structured to include directories and subdirectories, starting from a root (e.g., 'home') and ending with the file name (e.g., 'Sheet1.xls'). The paths vary in terms of the directory structure depth and naming conventions, indicating that the files are stored in different locations across the system. The commonality among all inputs is the file type (.xls) and the presence of a file name at the end of each path.

### Summary for Output Column Data:

The output data extracts and isolates the file name (including the .xls extension) from the given file paths. Regardless of the input path's complexity or the number of directories it traverses, the output consistently presents only the file name, stripping away all preceding directory information. This results in a simplified, uniform set of data focused solely on the Excel file names, without any indication of their original storage locations or the directory structure.

### Relationship Between Input and Output:

The relationship between the input and output data is a process of extraction and simplification. The input data, being qualitative in nature, provides detailed information about the storage location of various Excel files within a file system, represented through structured file paths. The transformation process to generate the output involves isolating the last component of these pathsâ€”the file name itself, including its extension.

This process signifies a filtering of information, where the specific location details (directories and subdirectories) are deemed irrelevant for the output's purpose, and only the file name is retained. The relationship underscores a focus shift from the context of the file's storage (input) to the identity of the file itself (output), facilitating operations or analyses that require only the file name without the need for its storage path context., and input as ['home/Excel/Sheet1.xls'] output is Sheet1.xls, input as ['home/user/Sheet1.xls'] output is Sheet1.xls, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
