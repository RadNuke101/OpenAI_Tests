Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: To generate a summary for the input and output columns based on the provided data, we'll first examine the data closely and then identify patterns or relationships that can be observed. The data consists of input rows with six values each and a single output value for each row. Let's break down the analysis into two parts: input column summary and output column summary.

### Input Column Summary

The input data consists of six columns, each with values ranging from 0 to 7 based on the examples provided. These values are qualitative in nature for this analysis, meaning we are looking at the presence or absence of certain values or patterns rather than performing quantitative calculations.

1. **Variety of Values**: The input columns contain a variety of values, from 0 up to 7. This range suggests a broad spectrum of categories or types represented in the data.
2. **Presence of Zeroes**: Zeroes are notably present in several inputs, sometimes dominating the row (e.g., '0 0 2 3 3 0'). This could indicate a category or condition where the absence of a certain feature or characteristic is significant.
3. **Repetition of Values**: Some rows show repetition of the same value within the row (e.g., '7 0 0 5 4 4' and '0 0 2 3 3 0'), which might suggest a pattern where the frequency of certain values within a row is relevant.

### Output Column Summary

The output values range from 2 to 6 based on the provided examples. These outputs are also treated as qualitative data, representing categories or outcomes that result from the combination of inputs.

1. **Range of Outcomes**: The outputs cover a range of values but do not include the extremes of the input range (0 and 7). This might indicate that the outputs are a categorization that does not directly map one-to-one with the input values.
2. **Variability**: The output values show variability in response to the inputs, suggesting a complex relationship where multiple factors (or combinations thereof) influence the outcome.

### Relationship Between Input and Output

Given the qualitative nature of this analysis, we can infer a few potential relationships:

1. **Influence of Zeroes**: The presence and number of zeroes in the input rows might be influencing the output value, possibly indicating scenarios where the absence of certain features leads to specific categorizations.
2. **Repetition and Diversity**: The repetition of values within a row and the diversity of values across the row seem to play a role in determining the output. Rows with higher repetition or less diversity might lead to different outcomes than those with a more varied set of values.
3. **Complex Combinations**: The relationship between the specific combinations of values in the input and the output suggests a complex rule set or algorithm that does not rely on simple arithmetic or direct mapping. Instead, it might involve conditional logic or pattern recognition to categorize the inputs into the observed outputs.

In summary, the relationship between the input columns and the output seems to be governed by a complex set of rules that take into account the presence of zeroes, the repetition of values, and the diversity of values within each row. Understanding this relationship in detail would likely require further analysis, possibly involving more data and a deeper exploration of the underlying rules or algorithms that generate the output from the given inputs., and input as ['7 0 0 5 4 4'] output is 3, input as ['0 0 2 3 3 0'] output is 3, input as ['5 6 4 6 0 7'] output is 4, input as ['0 4 5 0 0 2'] output is 2, input as ['3 0 3 0 1 2'] output is 2, input as ['5 3 2 5 6 1'] output is 6, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
