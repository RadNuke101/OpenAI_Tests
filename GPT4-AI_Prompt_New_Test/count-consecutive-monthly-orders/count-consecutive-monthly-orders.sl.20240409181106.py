Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: To generate a summary that describes the relationship between the input and the output, let's first understand the structure of the data and then analyze the patterns or relationships that might exist.

### Input Data Structure
The input data consists of lists of six numbers each. These numbers range from 0 to 7 based on the examples provided. Each list represents a unique combination of these numbers.

### Output Data Structure
The output is a single number that corresponds to each input list. This number also falls within a range, specifically 2 to 6 based on the examples.

### Summary of Input Columns
- **Variability**: The input columns show a wide range of numbers from 0 to 7. Each position in the list can contain any number within this range.
- **Distribution**: There's no clear pattern in the distribution of numbers across the input lists based on the examples given. Numbers appear to be distributed somewhat randomly.

### Summary of Output Column
- **Range**: The output numbers range from 2 to 6.
- **Distribution**: There is no immediately apparent pattern in the distribution of output values based on the input values alone.

### Relationship Between Input and Output
Given the qualitative nature of this analysis, we can infer the following:
- **No Direct Correlation**: There doesn't seem to be a direct, linear correlation between any single input number and the output. The relationship, if any, is more complex.
- **Possible Pattern Recognition**: The output might depend on a pattern or a combination of numbers in the input rather than their individual values. For example, the presence of certain numbers, their positions, or the relationship between the numbers in the list might influence the output.
- **Complexity**: The relationship between input and output is not straightforward. It could involve rules based on the arrangement or specific combinations of numbers in the input lists.

### Conclusion
The relationship between the input lists of numbers and the corresponding output number is not immediately clear from a qualitative analysis. The output seems to depend on more complex patterns or combinations of numbers in the input rather than on simple, direct correlations. Further analysis, possibly involving quantitative methods or a deeper understanding of the rules governing the input-output relationship, would be necessary to accurately describe how the input data determines the output., and input as ['7 0 0 5 4 4'] output is 3, input as ['0 0 2 3 3 0'] output is 3, input as ['5 6 4 6 0 7'] output is 4, input as ['0 4 5 0 0 2'] output is 2, input as ['3 0 3 0 1 2'] output is 2, input as ['5 3 2 5 6 1'] output is 6, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
