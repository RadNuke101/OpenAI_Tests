Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Summary for Input Column Data:

The input data consists of two columns, each containing a series of names. The first column appears to contain given names, which are diverse in origin and suggest a wide range of cultural backgrounds. Names such as "Launa," "Lakenya," "Brendan," "Bradford," "Rudolf," and "Lara" indicate a variety of naming conventions, suggesting the data set might be internationally or culturally diverse. The second column, similarly diverse, seems to contain surnames or family names like "Withers," "Edison," "Hage," "Lango," "Akiyama," and "Constable." These names also reflect a broad spectrum of origins, including English, Japanese, and potentially others, pointing to a multicultural dataset. The pairing of these names in the input columns suggests individual identities, possibly representing a list of people from various backgrounds.

### Summary for Output Column Data:

The output data rearranges the input columns, placing the surname or family name before the given name, following the format "Surname GivenName." This transformation suggests a change in the presentation format of the names, possibly to align with naming conventions that prioritize the family name or for sorting purposes. The output maintains the integrity of the pairings, ensuring that each individual's given name and surname remain connected, but inverts their order. This could be reflective of a cultural preference or a specific requirement for data organization, such as in databases, official documents, or for alphabetical listing by surname.

### Relationship Summary:

The relationship between the input and output data is a systematic reordering of the elements within each row. The process takes the given name and surname from the input and swaps their positions for the output, transitioning from a "GivenName Surname" format to a "Surname GivenName" format. This transformation does not alter the names themselves but changes how they are presented. The purpose behind this could be multifaceted, including aligning with certain cultural or institutional naming conventions, facilitating sorting and retrieval processes, or standardizing data presentation. The consistent application of this transformation across a diverse set of names highlights a structured approach to data manipulation, focusing on the reorganization of existing information to meet specific criteria or preferences., and input as ['Launa', 'Withers'] output is Withers Launa, input as ['Lakenya', 'Edison'] output is Edison Lakenya, input as ['Brendan', 'Hage'] output is Hage Brendan, input as ['Bradford', 'Lango'] output is Lango Bradford, input as ['Rudolf', 'Akiyama'] output is Akiyama Rudolf, input as ['Lara', 'Constable'] output is Constable Lara, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
