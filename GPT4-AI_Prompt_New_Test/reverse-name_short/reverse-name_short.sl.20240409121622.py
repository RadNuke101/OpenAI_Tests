Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Summary of Input Column Data:

The input data consists of two columns, each containing a series of names. The first column appears to contain given names, which are diverse and include both traditionally masculine and feminine names, indicating a variety of individuals. These names range from more common ones to those that might be considered less common in English-speaking contexts, suggesting a broad cultural or ethnic diversity. Examples include "Launa," "Lakenya," "Brendan," "Bradford," "Rudolf," and "Lara."

The second column, similar to the first, contains a variety of names. However, these names seem to serve as surnames or family names, such as "Withers," "Edison," "Hage," "Lango," "Akiyama," and "Constable." These names also suggest a wide range of cultural or ethnic backgrounds, indicating a diverse set of individuals.

### Summary of Output Column Data:

The output data reorganizes the input names into a single column, following a specific pattern: the surname followed by the given name. This transformation suggests a reversal or inversion of the traditional Western naming convention, where the given name usually precedes the surname. The output maintains the integrity of each name pair but presents them in a format that might be more familiar in contexts where the family name is given prominence, such as in many East Asian cultures. Examples from the output include "Withers Launa," "Edison Lakenya," "Hage Brendan," "Lango Bradford," "Akiyama Rudolf," and "Constable Lara."

### Relationship Between Input and Output:

The relationship between the input and output data is characterized by a systematic transformation of the order in which names are presented. The process takes a pair of names, with the first name (given name) and the second name (surname) from the input, and swaps their positions to generate the output. This reordering does not alter the names themselves but changes their sequence, suggesting a purposeful reformatting to either meet a specific cultural naming convention, for anonymization, or for a particular organizational or data processing requirement. The transformation demonstrates a simple yet effective method of altering the presentation of personal names without losing the association between the given names and surnames of individuals., and input as ['Launa', 'Withers'] output is Withers Launa, input as ['Lakenya', 'Edison'] output is Edison Lakenya, input as ['Brendan', 'Hage'] output is Hage Brendan, input as ['Bradford', 'Lango'] output is Lango Bradford, input as ['Rudolf', 'Akiyama'] output is Akiyama Rudolf, input as ['Lara', 'Constable'] output is Constable Lara, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
