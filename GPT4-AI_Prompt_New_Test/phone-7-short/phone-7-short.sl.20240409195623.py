Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Summary of Input Column Data:

The input data consists of strings formatted as phone numbers with an international dialing code prefix. Each string is structured in a unique pattern that includes a country code (preceded by a '+'), followed by a space, and then a sequence of digits separated into three groups by hyphens. The first group of digits after the country code varies in length, possibly depending on the country code's length or other unspecified criteria. The second and third groups of digits are consistently separated by hyphens. This format suggests a standardized approach to representing phone numbers with an emphasis on international dialing codes and a specific segmentation of the remaining digits.

### Summary of Output Column Data:

The output data consists of the second group of digits from the input data's phone number format. These digits vary in length and numerical value, but they are consistently extracted from the same position within the input stringâ€”specifically, the digits that appear between the first and second hyphens. The output data does not seem to correlate directly with the country code or the total length of the phone number but is strictly determined by its position within the structured format of the input data.

### Relationship Between Input and Output:

The relationship between the input and output data is defined by a consistent rule: the output is always the second group of digits from the input string, regardless of the country code or the total length of the phone number. This indicates a process of selective extraction based on the position of the digits within a structured format rather than any numerical analysis or manipulation of the digits themselves. The input data's format as international phone numbers serves as a container from which specific information (the second group of digits) is systematically extracted to produce the output. This process highlights a method of data parsing where the focus is on the segmentation of the input string according to predefined separators (hyphens) and the extraction of a particular segment based on its order in the sequence., and input as ['+106 769-858-438'] output is 858, input as ['+83 973-757-831'] output is 757, input as ['+62 647-787-775'] output is 787, input as ['+172 027-507-632'] output is 507, input as ['+72 001-050-856'] output is 050, input as ['+95 310-537-401'] output is 537, input as ['+6 775-969-238'] output is 969, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
