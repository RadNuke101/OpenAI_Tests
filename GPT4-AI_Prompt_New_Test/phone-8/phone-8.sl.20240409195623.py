Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Input Column Summary:

The input data consists of strings that represent phone numbers in a specific format. Each string begins with a country code prefixed with a plus sign ('+'), followed by a space, and then the phone number itself. The phone number is divided into three groups separated by hyphens ('-'). The first group varies in length and appears to represent an area code or a similar identifier, the second group consists of three digits, and the third group also consists of three digits. The format can be summarized as follows: `+<country_code> <group1>-<group2>-<group3>`.

The country codes and the first group of numbers vary in length and value, indicating a diverse set of regions or countries. The second and third groups are consistently three digits long across all entries. The diversity in the country codes and the first group of numbers suggests that the dataset includes a wide range of geographical locations or networks.

### Output Column Summary:

The output data consists of integers extracted from the input strings. Specifically, these integers are the third group of numbers from the input phone numbers, following the last hyphen. The output values are three-digit numbers ranging from 238 to 856, based on the provided examples.

### Relationship Summary:

The relationship between the input and output data is straightforward: the output is directly extracted from the input. For each input string, the output is the last three digits of the phone number, which is the part of the string following the second hyphen. This extraction process ignores the country code, the first group of numbers, and the second group of numbers, focusing solely on the final group. The output, therefore, represents a specific segment of the input data, highlighting the consistency in the structure of the phone numbers despite the variability in their country codes and initial segments. This relationship suggests a method of parsing or processing phone numbers to extract a particular piece of information, which could be useful in contexts where the last three digits carry specific significance or utility., and input as ['+106 769-858-438'] output is 438, input as ['+83 973-757-831'] output is 831, input as ['+62 647-787-775'] output is 775, input as ['+172 027-507-632'] output is 632, input as ['+72 001-050-856'] output is 856, input as ['+95 310-537-401'] output is 401, input as ['+6 775-969-238'] output is 238, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
