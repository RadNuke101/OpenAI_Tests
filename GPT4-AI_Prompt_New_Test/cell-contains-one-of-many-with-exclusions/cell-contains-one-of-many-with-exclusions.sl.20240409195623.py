Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Input Column Summary:

The input data consists of four columns. The first column contains phrases that describe objects with specific colors and sometimes additional descriptive elements (e.g., "yellow dog on green grass"). The subsequent three columns list individual words, which seem to be primarily colors (e.g., "yellow", "green") and occasionally other descriptive terms (e.g., "neon"). These words appear to be elements that could be related to the phrases in the first column, either directly through the presence of the same words or indirectly through related concepts.

### Output Column Summary:

The output data is binary, represented as true or false. It indicates whether there is a certain type of relationship or condition met between the first column's phrases and the words listed in the next three columns. The pattern suggests that the output is true when at least one of the words from the subsequent columns is directly mentioned in the phrase from the first column or when there's a strong thematic or descriptive connection.

### Relationship Summary:

The relationship between the input and output seems to be based on the presence or thematic relevance of the words in the last three columns to the phrase in the first column. When analyzing the data:

- If the phrase in the first column contains at least one of the words from the next three columns, the output tends to be true. This is evident in cases where colors or specific terms from the latter columns are directly mentioned in the phrase (e.g., "yellow dog on green grass" with "yellow" and "green" being present).
  
- The output is false when none of the words from the last three columns are directly mentioned or thematically connected to the phrase in the first column. For instance, "warm gray sweater" does not contain "yellow", "green", or "cat", nor does it have a thematic connection to these words, resulting in a false output.

- There seems to be a leniency towards thematic connections or the presence of related descriptive terms, not just strict word matching. For example, "hot pink socks" is true with "pink" being directly mentioned, but "blue neon signs" is false despite "blue" and "neon" being present, possibly due to the absence of a thematic connection with the other words.

In summary, the output's truth value is determined by the direct mention or thematic relevance of the words in the last three columns to the phrase in the first column. This relationship underscores the importance of both lexical presence and thematic congruence in determining the output., and input as ['yellow dog on green grass', 'yellow', 'green', 'cat'] output is true, input as ['warm gray sweater', 'yellow', 'green', 'cat'] output is false, input as ['blue neon signs', 'blue', 'green', 'neon'] output is false, input as ['hot pink socks', 'blue', 'pink', 'neon'] output is true, input as ['deep black eyes', 'yellow', 'green', 'neon'] output is false, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
