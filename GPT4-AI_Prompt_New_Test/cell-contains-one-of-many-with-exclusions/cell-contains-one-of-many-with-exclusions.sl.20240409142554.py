Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Input Column Summary:

The input data consists of four columns. The first column contains phrases that describe objects or scenes with specific colors and sometimes additional descriptive elements (e.g., "yellow dog on green grass"). The next three columns contain single words, which are primarily colors (e.g., "yellow," "green") but can also include other descriptive elements (e.g., "neon"). These columns seem to represent specific attributes or elements that might be searched for or identified within the phrases of the first column.

1. **First Column (Phrases):** Descriptive phrases that combine colors with objects or scenes. These phrases are rich in imagery and provide a context in which the colors and objects interact.
2. **Second to Fourth Columns (Attributes):** These columns contain individual words that are used to identify specific attributes (mainly colors) or elements within the first column's phrases.

### Output Column Summary:

The output data is a binary indicator (true or false) that seems to reflect whether a certain condition or set of conditions is met based on the relationship between the first column's phrases and the attributes listed in the subsequent three columns.

### Relationship Summary:

The relationship between the input columns and the output seems to be based on a matching or identification process. The output is `true` when the attributes listed in the second to fourth columns are all found within the phrase in the first column. This indicates a direct correlation between the presence of these attributes in the descriptive phrases and the binary outcome. The process appears to evaluate the presence of specific colors and possibly other descriptive elements within the context provided by the first column's phrases.

- When all the attributes (colors or elements) listed in the second to fourth columns are identified within the phrase in the first column, the output is `true`.
- If at least one of the attributes is not found within the phrase, the output is `false`.

This relationship suggests a rule-based system where the output is determined by the successful matching of all listed attributes with the components of the descriptive phrase. The nature of this system emphasizes the importance of each attribute being present for the output to be `true`, highlighting a strict and all-inclusive matching criterion., and input as ['yellow dog on green grass', 'yellow', 'green', 'cat'] output is true, input as ['warm gray sweater', 'yellow', 'green', 'cat'] output is false, input as ['blue neon signs', 'blue', 'green', 'neon'] output is false, input as ['hot pink socks', 'blue', 'pink', 'neon'] output is true, input as ['deep black eyes', 'yellow', 'green', 'neon'] output is false, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
