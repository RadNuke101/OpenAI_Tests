Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Input Column Summary

The input data consists of a single column containing strings that represent numerical values. Each entry in the column is a string that looks like a positive integer (e.g., '101', '1002', '743'). These strings do not have leading zeros, and they represent a wide range of values, suggesting variability in magnitude. The data is qualitative in nature, as it is represented in a textual format, despite resembling numerical values. The variability in the length of these strings (ranging from three to four characters in the provided examples) indicates a diversity in the magnitude of the values they represent.

### Output Column Summary

The output data directly corresponds to the input data, with each string from the input being converted into an actual numerical value in the output. For instance, the string '101' from the input is converted to the number 101 in the output. This transformation process maintains the integrity of the value represented by the input string, effectively changing its data type from a string to an integer. The output, therefore, consists of positive integers that mirror the values indicated by the input strings. The output is quantitative, providing a numerical representation of the previously qualitative input data.

### Relationship Summary

The relationship between the input and output data is a straightforward transformation from a qualitative representation of numbers (as strings) to a quantitative representation (as integers). This process involves parsing the strings from the input column to produce corresponding numerical values in the output column. The transformation preserves the value represented by each string, merely changing the format from text to number. This conversion process suggests a direct, one-to-one mapping between each input string and its numerical counterpart in the output, with no alteration to the value itself. The relationship underscores a data processing step where qualitative data (textual numerical representations) is converted into a quantitative format (actual numbers) for further analysis or computation., and input as ['101'] output is 101, input as ['1002'] output is 1002, input as ['743'] output is 743, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
