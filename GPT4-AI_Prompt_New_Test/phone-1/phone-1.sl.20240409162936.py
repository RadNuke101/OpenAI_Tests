Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Based on the provided data, we can observe a clear pattern in how the input relates to the output. The input data are strings formatted as three groups of three digits, separated by hyphens (e.g., 'XXX-YYY-ZZZ'). The output data are integers extracted from these strings. Specifically, the output is always the middle group of three digits from the input string.

**Summary for Input Column Data:**
- The input data consist of strings formatted in a specific pattern: three groups of three digits each, separated by hyphens.
- Each group of digits ranges from 000 to 999, but no specific range or pattern within these groups is indicated by the given examples.
- The input data do not show any immediate numerical relationship or pattern that determines the output, other than the position of the digits within the string.

**Summary for Output Column Data:**
- The output data are integers extracted directly from the input strings.
- Specifically, the output is always the second group of three digits in the input string.
- The range of the output data is within 000 to 999, consistent with the possible range of any three-digit group in the input.
- There is no transformation or calculation applied to the digits; they are simply extracted and presented as integers.

**Relationship Summary:**
- The relationship between the input and output is defined purely by the position of the digits within the input string. The output is always the second group of three digits from the input, indicating a positional extraction rather than a mathematical or logical transformation.
- This relationship suggests that the process to obtain the output from the input is consistent and predictable, based solely on the structure of the input data.
- The input data can be considered qualitative in this context, as the specific numerical values do not influence the output beyond their position in the sequence. The process is akin to a string manipulation operation rather than a numerical computation.

In summary, the relationship between the input and output data in this scenario is defined by a simple rule of extracting the middle group of digits from a structured string, treating the input as a source of qualitative data where the position of the digits determines the output., and input as ['938-242-504'] output is 242, input as ['308-916-545'] output is 916, input as ['623-599-749'] output is 599, input as ['981-424-843'] output is 424, input as ['118-980-214'] output is 980, input as ['244-655-094'] output is 655, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
