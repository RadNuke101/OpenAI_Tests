Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Input Column Summary:

The input data consists of strings that are encapsulated within HTML bold tags (`<b>` and `<b>`). Each string represents a numerical value, formatted as a decimal number, and is enclosed within these tags. The data appears to be qualitative in nature, as it is represented in a specific format (HTML tags with decimal numbers) rather than being direct numerical values. The input values vary in their decimal length, indicating a range of precision in the represented numbers.

### Output Column Summary:

The output data consists of numerical values extracted from the input strings. These values are presented as decimals, retaining the precision specified in the input data. The transformation from input to output involves removing the HTML bold tags and converting the remaining string into a numerical format. This process results in a clean, numeric representation of the originally formatted data.

### Relationship Summary:

The relationship between the input and output data is a process of data cleaning and format conversion. The input data, while qualitative in its representation (due to the inclusion of HTML tags and the presentation as strings), encodes quantitative information in the form of decimal numbers. The process involves:

1. **Stripping HTML Tags**: Removing the `<b>` and `<b>` tags from the input strings to isolate the numerical information.
2. **Conversion to Numeric Format**: Transforming the cleaned string into a numeric data type that can be used for quantitative analysis.

This relationship highlights a common task in data processing where qualitative data formats are used to convey quantitative information. The key operation is extracting the meaningful numeric values from the qualitative representations, enabling further numerical analysis or processing. The process effectively bridges the gap between qualitative data representation and quantitative data analysis., and input as ['<b>0.66<b>'] output is 0.66, input as ['<b>0.409<b>'] output is 0.409, input as ['<b>0.7268<b>'] output is 0.7268, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
