Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Summary of Input Column Data:

The input data consists of strings encapsulated within HTML bold tags (`<b>` and `<b>`). Each string represents a numerical value, formatted as a decimal number. The data appears to be qualitative in nature, as it is presented within a textual and HTML context, despite representing quantitative values. The input values vary in their decimal length, indicating a range of precision in the numbers provided. The use of HTML tags suggests that the data might be extracted from a web page or a document where formatting is crucial for emphasis.

### Summary of Output Column Data:

The output data consists of numerical values extracted from the input strings. These values are presented as floating-point numbers, retaining the precision indicated in the input data. The transformation from the input to the output involves the removal of the HTML bold tags and the conversion of the textual representation of the numbers into a numerical data format. This process suggests a cleaning or parsing operation where the qualitative aspects (HTML tags) are stripped away to isolate the quantitative information (numerical values).

### Relationship Between Input and Output:

The relationship between the input and output data is characterized by a data cleaning or parsing process, where the essential numerical information is extracted from a formatted textual representation. The input data, while qualitative due to its textual and HTML-tagged nature, contains quantitative information in the form of decimal numbers. The process to obtain the output involves:

1. Identifying and removing the HTML bold tags that encapsulate the numerical value.
2. Converting the remaining text, which represents a decimal number, into a floating-point numerical format.

This transformation highlights a common task in data processing where valuable quantitative information needs to be extracted from qualitative data sources. The consistency in the transformation process across all data points suggests a standardized method for handling similar types of formatted textual data to isolate and utilize the quantitative information contained within., and input as ['<b>0.66<b>'] output is 0.66, input as ['<b>0.409<b>'] output is 0.409, input as ['<b>0.7268<b>'] output is 0.7268, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
