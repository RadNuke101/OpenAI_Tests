Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Input Column Summary:

The input data consists of two columns. The first column contains date ranges in a string format, where each range is represented by two dates separated by a dash ('-'). These date ranges are provided in two formats: MM/DD/YY (e.g., '1/17/16-1/18/17') and MM/DD/YYYY (e.g., '01/17/2016-01/18/2017'). The variation in date format indicates the presence of both two-digit and four-digit year representations, as well as a possible variation in the month and day format (leading zeros).

The second column contains a single digit as a string ('1' or '2'), which appears to indicate a selection or position within the date range provided in the first column.

### Output Column Summary:

The output data is a single column that contains dates in a string format. These dates correspond to either the start or the end of the date range provided in the first column of the input data. The format of the output dates matches the format of the dates in the input range, maintaining consistency between MM/DD/YY and MM/DD/YYYY formats as per the input. This suggests that the output format is directly influenced by the format of the input date range.

### Relationship Summary:

The relationship between the input and output data can be summarized as follows:

1. **Selection of Date Based on Position Indicator**: The second column in the input data acts as a position indicator, determining which date from the range (first column) is selected as the output. A value of '1' selects the start date of the range, while a value of '2' selects the end date.

2. **Preservation of Date Format**: The format of the output date (whether MM/DD/YY or MM/DD/YYYY) is directly derived from the format of the input date range. This indicates that the process respects and maintains the original date format provided in the input.

3. **Direct Mapping**: There is a direct mapping from the input to the output based on the position indicator. This process does not involve any transformation or computation of the dates themselves but rather a selection based on the input criteria.

In summary, the input data provides a mechanism for selecting a specific date from a given range, with the selection criteria specified by the second column. The output is a direct reflection of this selection, maintaining the original format of the dates as provided in the input., and input as ['1/17/16-1/18/17', '1'] output is 1/17/16, input as ['1/17/16-1/18/17', '2'] output is 1/18/17, input as ['01/17/2016-01/18/2017', '1'] output is 01/17/2016, input as ['01/17/2016-01/18/2017', '2'] output is 01/18/2017, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.

    Selects a date from a given date range based on the position indicator.

    Parameters:
