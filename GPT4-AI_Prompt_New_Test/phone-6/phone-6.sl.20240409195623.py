Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Summary of Input Column Data

The input data consists of strings that represent phone numbers in a specific format. Each string begins with a '+' sign followed by a country code, which varies in length (ranging from one to three digits). After the country code, there is a space, followed by a sequence of digits separated into three groups by hyphens. The first group after the country code contains three digits, the second group also contains three digits, and the third group contains three digits, making up a consistent pattern across all inputs. The country codes and the sequences of digits vary across the inputs, indicating a diverse set of data points from different regions or countries. The input data is qualitative, representing different instances of formatted phone numbers.

### Summary of Output Column Data

The output data consists of three-digit numbers extracted from each input string. These numbers are specifically the first group of digits that follow immediately after the country code and the initial space in the input strings. The output numbers range from '001' to '775', showing a variety of values but all within the constraint of being three digits long. The output data is qualitative in this context, as it represents a specific segment of the input data rather than a quantitative measure or calculation derived from the input.

### Relationship Between Input and Output

The relationship between the input and output data is direct and follows a specific pattern: the output is always the first group of three digits that appear immediately after the country code and the space in the input string. This pattern is consistent across all data points, indicating a rule-based extraction of the output from the input. The extraction process does not alter the digits themselves but selects a specific portion of the input string based on its structure. The output can be seen as a subset of the input, specifically chosen based on its position within the structured format of the input data. This relationship highlights a methodical approach to parsing and extracting specific information (in this case, a segment of a phone number) from a standardized format., and input as ['+106 769-858-438'] output is 769, input as ['+83 973-757-831'] output is 973, input as ['+62 647-787-775'] output is 647, input as ['+172 027-507-632'] output is 027, input as ['+72 001-050-856'] output is 001, input as ['+95 310-537-401'] output is 310, input as ['+6 775-969-238'] output is 775, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
