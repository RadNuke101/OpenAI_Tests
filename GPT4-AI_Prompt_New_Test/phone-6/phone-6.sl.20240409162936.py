Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Input Column Summary:

The input data consists of strings that follow a specific format: a plus sign (+) followed by a country code, a space, and then a three-part phone number separated by hyphens. The country code varies in length, ranging from one to three digits. The phone number is consistently formatted as three groups of digits: the first group has three digits, the second group has three digits, and the third group has three digits, making it a consistent pattern across all inputs. The input data represents international phone numbers with their respective country codes.

### Output Column Summary:

The output data extracted from each input string is consistently the first group of three digits from the phone number part of the input string, immediately following the country code and space. This output ignores the country code and focuses solely on the first part of the phone number, providing a subset of the original input data. The output is always a three-digit number, which appears to represent the area or city code part of the phone number in the input.

### Relationship Summary:

The relationship between the input and output data is straightforward and consistent. The output is derived directly from the input by extracting a specific part of the input string. For each input, the output is the first group of three digits from the phone number, which follows the country code and a space. This extraction process ignores the country code and the rest of the phone number, focusing solely on the area or city code. The process is qualitative in nature, as it involves parsing and extracting specific segments from a structured text input rather than performing any quantitative analysis or manipulation of the data. The relationship highlights a methodical approach to data extraction, where a specific pattern within a larger dataset is identified and isolated as the output., and input as ['+106 769-858-438'] output is 769, input as ['+83 973-757-831'] output is 973, input as ['+62 647-787-775'] output is 647, input as ['+172 027-507-632'] output is 027, input as ['+72 001-050-856'] output is 001, input as ['+95 310-537-401'] output is 310, input as ['+6 775-969-238'] output is 775, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
