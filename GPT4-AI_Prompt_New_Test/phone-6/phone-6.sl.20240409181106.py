Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Summary of Input Column Data

The input data consists of strings formatted as international phone numbers. Each entry begins with a country code prefixed by a plus sign ('+'), followed by a space, and then a sequence of digits separated into three groups by hyphens. The first group after the country code varies in length, typically containing three or four digits, but can be as few as two or as many as four. The subsequent groups of digits after the first hyphen appear to follow a consistent format, but they are not relevant to the task at hand. The variety in the length of the initial group of digits after the country code suggests a diversity in the formatting conventions of phone numbers across different regions or countries. The data is qualitative, representing a structured form of textual information rather than numerical values to be calculated or aggregated.

### Summary of Output Column Data

The output data extracts a specific portion of the input data: the first group of digits immediately following the country code and space. This extracted segment varies in length, typically containing three digits, but can also be as few as two or as many as four. The output is also qualitative, representing a specific subset of the information contained within the input data. It isolates a part of the phone number that could potentially be used to identify a more specific geographic area or network within the broader context provided by the country code.

### Relationship Between Input and Output

The relationship between the input and output data is a direct extraction process where the output is a specific component of the input. Specifically, the output captures the first group of digits that follow the country code and the initial space in the input string. This process effectively isolates a segment of the phone number that may be significant for certain analyses or categorizations, such as identifying regional codes or networks within a country. The extraction process disregards the country code and the rest of the phone number, focusing solely on this first group of digits for output. This relationship underscores a methodical approach to parsing and extracting specific information from structured textual data, where the input is a standardized format of international phone numbers, and the output zeroes in on a particular detail of interest within that format., and input as ['+106 769-858-438'] output is 769, input as ['+83 973-757-831'] output is 973, input as ['+62 647-787-775'] output is 647, input as ['+172 027-507-632'] output is 027, input as ['+72 001-050-856'] output is 001, input as ['+95 310-537-401'] output is 310, input as ['+6 775-969-238'] output is 775, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
