Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Input Column Summary:

The input data consists of a single column containing qualitative descriptors, specifically names of colors such as 'yellow', 'gray', 'black', 'blue', 'pink', and 'orange', along with one non-color entry 'turkey'. These inputs represent a mix of primary colors, secondary colors, and neutral tones, along with an outlier that does not fit into the color category. This diversity in the input data suggests that the relationship between the input and the output might be based on specific attributes or characteristics associated with the inputs rather than their category as a whole.

### Output Column Summary:

The output data is binary, consisting of true or false values. This binary nature indicates that the output is likely determined by the presence or absence of certain characteristics or criteria being met by the input data. The distribution of true and false values suggests a pattern or rule that governs whether an input yields a true or false output, rather than random assignment.

### Relationship Summary:

Analyzing the relationship between the input colors and the binary output, it appears that the output is true for certain colors ('yellow', 'blue', 'pink', 'orange') and false for others ('gray', 'black', 'turkey'). Notably, the true outputs are associated with colors that are generally considered vibrant or primary/secondary colors, while the false outputs are associated with neutral colors ('gray', 'black') and a non-color input ('turkey'). This suggests that the determining factor for the output might be related to the vibrancy or category (primary/secondary vs. neutral) of the color, with vibrant and primary/secondary colors yielding a true output and neutral colors or non-colors yielding a false output. The presence of 'turkey' as a false output reinforces the idea that the criteria for a true output are specifically related to being a recognized, vibrant color., and input as ['yellow'] output is true, input as ['gray'] output is false, input as ['black'] output is false, input as ['blue'] output is true, input as ['pink'] output is true, input as ['orange'] output is true, input as ['turkey'] output is false, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
