Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Input Column Summary:

The input data consists of a single column containing qualitative descriptors, specifically names of colors such as 'yellow', 'gray', 'black', 'blue', 'pink', 'orange', and an outlier 'turkey' which is not a color but rather an object or a country name. This indicates that the primary focus of the input data is on color names, with a single instance of a non-color entry. The colors mentioned span a range of the visible spectrum and include both primary colors (like blue) and secondary or composite colors (like orange and pink).

### Output Column Summary:

The output data is binary, consisting of boolean values true or false. These values are associated with each input entry, suggesting a direct relationship or rule that determines the output based on the input color name. The pattern of outputs indicates a specific criterion or set of criteria being applied to the input colors to decide the output value.

### Relationship Summary:

Analyzing the given input-output pairs, the relationship between the input color names and the output boolean values seems to be based on a specific characteristic or set of characteristics of the colors. The colors 'yellow', 'blue', 'pink', and 'orange' result in a true output, while 'gray', 'black', and 'turkey' lead to a false output. 

Given the data, one might infer that the characteristic determining the output could be related to the perceived brightness or vividness of the color, with brighter or more vivid colors leading to a true output and darker or non-color inputs leading to a false output. 'Turkey', being an outlier and not a color, naturally does not fit the criteria for a true output based on color characteristics, further suggesting that the relationship is strictly tied to the properties of color names.

However, without more detailed criteria or additional examples, especially with close edge cases, this summary is based on the observable pattern in the provided data and the common characteristics of the colors leading to true outputs. The exact rule or set of rules used to determine the output from the color name input remains a hypothesis based on the given examples., and input as ['yellow'] output is true, input as ['gray'] output is false, input as ['black'] output is false, input as ['blue'] output is true, input as ['pink'] output is true, input as ['orange'] output is true, input as ['turkey'] output is false, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
