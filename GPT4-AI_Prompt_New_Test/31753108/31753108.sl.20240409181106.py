Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Summary for Input Column Data:

The input data consists of strings that describe various vehicle maintenance or monitoring components, each followed by a unique alphanumeric code. These strings typically start with the name of the vehicle component or system being referred to, such as "Tire Pressure," "Oil Life," or "Air conditioner," indicating the specific area of the vehicle that requires attention or monitoring. This is followed by the unique alphanumeric code that likely serves as an identifier for the specific part, maintenance task, or monitoring parameter. The data structure is consistent across entries, with the component/system name leading, followed by the unique identifier, which varies in length and alphanumeric composition. The presence of additional descriptive words like "Monitor," "gauge," or "maintenance" suggests the purpose or context of the identifier but does not follow a strict pattern in terms of positioning within the string.

### Summary for Output Column Data:

The output data extracts and isolates the unique alphanumeric codes from the input strings, serving as identifiers for the specific vehicle component or maintenance task mentioned. These codes vary in length and composition but are consistently positioned within the input data following the description of the vehicle component or system. The output data strips away all other descriptive text, focusing solely on these identifiers, which are crucial for distinguishing between different maintenance tasks, parts, or monitoring parameters.

### Relationship Summary between Input and Output:

The relationship between the input and output data is characterized by a filtering or extraction process, where the output isolates a specific, critical piece of information (the unique alphanumeric code) from a more descriptive context provided in the input. The input data provides a qualitative description of a vehicle-related component or maintenance need, along with this unique identifier embedded within the text. The output's role is to distill this information down to just the unique identifier, removing all other contextual or descriptive text. This process highlights the importance of the alphanumeric codes as key identifiers amidst broader descriptive information, suggesting that these codes are essential for tracking, referencing, or managing vehicle maintenance tasks, parts, or monitoring systems. The extraction of these codes from a mixed descriptive context underscores their utility in more technical or administrative capacities, where precise identification is necessary., and input as ['Tire Pressure ABC123873 Monitor'] output is ABC123873, input as [' Oil Life ABC849999999021 gauge'] output is ABC849999999021, input as [' Air conditioner GHF211 maintenance'] output is GHF211, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
