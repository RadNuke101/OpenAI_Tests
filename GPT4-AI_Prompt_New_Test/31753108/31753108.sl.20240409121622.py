Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Summary for Input Column Data

The input data consists of strings that describe various vehicle maintenance or monitoring components, each followed by a unique alphanumeric identifier. These strings typically start with the name of the vehicle component or system being referenced, such as "Tire Pressure," "Oil Life," or "Air conditioner," indicating the specific aspect of the vehicle that requires monitoring or maintenance. Following the component name, there is a unique identifier composed of a combination of letters and numbers (e.g., "ABC123873," "ABC849999999021," "GHF211"). This identifier is likely a part number, serial number, or a specific reference code that uniquely identifies the component or the specific maintenance requirement within a larger system or database. The input data, therefore, appears to serve a dual purpose: it categorizes the vehicle component or system in question and provides a unique identifier for that specific item or maintenance requirement.

### Summary for Output Column Data

The output data extracts and isolates the unique alphanumeric identifier from each input string. These identifiers ("ABC123873," "ABC849999999021," "GHF211") are crucial for distinguishing between different components or maintenance requirements. By focusing solely on these identifiers, the output data streamlines the process of referencing, cataloging, or taking action on the specific vehicle components or maintenance tasks mentioned in the input data. This simplification could be particularly useful in a database, inventory management system, or maintenance scheduling tool where quick and accurate reference to specific parts or tasks is necessary.

### Relationship Summary Between Input and Output

The relationship between the input and output data is characterized by a process of extraction and focus. From the broader context provided in the input strings, which includes both the name of a vehicle component or system and its unique identifier, the output data extracts only the unique identifier. This process of extraction indicates a prioritization of the unique identifiers over the descriptive component names for the purposes of the output data. The unique identifiers are likely seen as the most critical piece of information for subsequent actions or references, possibly due to their role in uniquely distinguishing between items or requirements in a system where precise identification is crucial. The input data provides a contextual backdrop, mentioning specific vehicle components or maintenance tasks, while the output data zeroes in on the unique identifiers, suggesting that these codes are essential for tracking, referencing, or acting upon the mentioned components or tasks within a given system or framework., and input as ['Tire Pressure ABC123873 Monitor'] output is ABC123873, input as [' Oil Life ABC849999999021 gauge'] output is ABC849999999021, input as [' Air conditioner GHF211 maintenance'] output is GHF211, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
