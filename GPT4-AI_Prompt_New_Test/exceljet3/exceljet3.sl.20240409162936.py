Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: To generate a summary for each input column and the output column based on the examples provided, we will first examine the nature of the data in each column and then discuss the relationship between the inputs and the output.

### Input Columns Summary:

1. **Year**: This column represents the manufacturing year of a vehicle. The data is numerical but should be treated as categorical or qualitative in this context since each year represents a distinct category of vehicles produced in that timeframe. For example, 'year= 2016' indicates vehicles manufactured in the year 2016.

2. **Make**: This column specifies the brand or manufacturer of the vehicle. It is a qualitative attribute that categorizes vehicles by their manufacturer. For instance, 'make= subaru' refers to vehicles produced by Subaru.

3. **Model**: This column describes the specific model of the vehicle, which is a qualitative attribute providing a more detailed categorization within a make. For example, 'model= outback wagon' identifies vehicles of the Outback Wagon model by Subaru.

4. **Fuel Economy**: This column indicates the fuel efficiency of the vehicle, typically represented in miles per gallon (MPG) for city/highway driving. Although the data appears numerical, it is treated qualitatively in this context as it categorizes vehicles into different efficiency classes. For instance, 'fuel economy= 25/33' categorizes a vehicle as having a city/highway fuel efficiency of 25/33 MPG.

### Output Column Summary:

The output for each input row is the specific value or attribute described by the input column. It is a direct extraction from the input data, representing specific characteristics of a vehicle such as its manufacturing year, make, model, or fuel economy. The output is qualitative, reflecting the categorical nature of the input data.

### Relationship Between Input and Output:

The relationship between the input columns and the output is a direct mapping, where each input column specifies a particular aspect or characteristic of a vehicle, and the output is the specific value or attribute for that aspect. The input columns collectively describe various qualitative attributes of a vehicle, such as its manufacturing year, brand, model, and fuel efficiency. The output, on the other hand, isolates and presents these attributes individually based on the input column being considered.

This structure allows for a detailed categorization of vehicles based on multiple qualitative attributes, facilitating easy identification and comparison of vehicles based on their characteristics. The direct mapping from input to output ensures that each attribute of a vehicle is clearly defined and accessible, providing a comprehensive overview of the vehicle's qualitative features., and input as ['year= 2016'] output is 2016, input as ['make= subaru'] output is subaru, input as ['model= outback wagon'] output is outback wagon, input as ['fuel economy= 25/33'] output is 25/33, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
