Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: To generate summaries for each input column and the output column based on the examples provided, let's first understand the nature of the data and its relationship.

### Input Columns Summary:

1. **Year**: This column represents the manufacturing year of the vehicle. It is a qualitative representation of time, indicating when the vehicle was produced. The example given is "2016", suggesting that the data might range across various years, reflecting the diversity in vehicle age.

2. **Make**: This column specifies the brand or manufacturer of the vehicle. The example "subaru" indicates that this column contains the names of different car manufacturers, showcasing the variety of brands available in the dataset.

3. **Model**: This column contains the specific model of the vehicle, along with any additional descriptors. The example "outback wagon" suggests that this column not only includes the model name but may also contain further classification or type information (like "wagon"), providing a detailed identification of the vehicle.

4. **Fuel Economy**: Represented by the example "25/33", this column seems to provide information on the vehicle's fuel efficiency, possibly in a format that denotes city/highway miles per gallon (MPG). This qualitative data gives insight into the vehicle's performance in terms of fuel consumption.

### Output Column Summary:

The output for each input seems to be the specific value or description associated with each column. This suggests that the output column is a direct reflection of the input data, providing specific details about the vehicle's year, make, model, and fuel economy based on the input category. The output is qualitative, focusing on descriptive aspects rather than quantitative measurements.

### Relationship Between Input and Output:

The relationship between the input columns and the output is direct and descriptive. Each input column represents a different characteristic of a vehicle, and the output is the specific detail or value corresponding to that characteristic. This structure allows for a detailed and categorized description of vehicles, where each input column focuses on a different aspect, and the output provides the exact information for that category. The setup is useful for organizing and retrieving specific vehicle information based on distinct attributes like the year of manufacture, brand, model, and fuel efficiency. This method of data organization facilitates easy access to detailed characteristics of vehicles, making it straightforward to understand and analyze the qualitative aspects of the dataset., and input as ['year= 2016'] output is 2016, input as ['make= subaru'] output is subaru, input as ['model= outback wagon'] output is outback wagon, input as ['fuel economy= 25/33'] output is 25/33, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
