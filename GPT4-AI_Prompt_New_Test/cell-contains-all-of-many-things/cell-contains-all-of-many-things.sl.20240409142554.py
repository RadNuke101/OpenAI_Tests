Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Input Column Summary:

The input data consists of a collection of sentences, each followed by a set of keywords. The sentences describe various scenes or objects, often incorporating colors and elements from the natural or man-made environment. The keywords following each sentence are specific words that seem to be of interest for analysis within the context of the sentence. These keywords typically include colors and other significant nouns or subjects present in the sentence. The variety of sentences covers different scenarios, from animals on grass to objects on sand, and even abstract concepts like a sun in a field or a neon sign.

### Output Column Summary:

The output data is binary (true or false), indicating whether a certain condition or set of conditions is met by the corresponding input sentence and its keywords. The true or false outcome appears to be determined by whether all the keywords listed after each sentence are directly represented or can be directly inferred from the content of the sentence.

### Relationship Summary:

The relationship between the input and output data hinges on the presence and direct mention of the keywords within the sentences. When all the keywords are explicitly mentioned or clearly implied in the sentence, the output is true. This suggests that the output is a function of keyword detection within the sentences. The process does not seem to account for abstract or indirect relationships between the keywords and the sentence content but rather focuses on direct mentions or clear implications.

- For sentences where the keywords are all present or their presence is strongly implied in the context (e.g., a dog on grass with specific colors mentioned), the output is true.
- For sentences where at least one of the keywords is not mentioned or its presence cannot be directly inferred from the sentence (e.g., mentioning colors and a field but not the specific object of interest like a dog), the output is false.

This indicates that the analysis or algorithm behind the output is designed to verify the direct inclusion of certain elements (as specified by the keywords) within the narrative or description provided by the sentences., and input as ['yellow dog on green grass', 'yellow', 'green', 'dog'] output is true, input as ['Lone dog with a green frisbie on yellow sand', 'yellow', 'green', 'dog'] output is true, input as ['A yellow sun in a green field', 'yellow', 'green', 'dog'] output is false, input as ['yellow neon sign with a green background', 'yellow', 'green', 'dog'] output is false, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
