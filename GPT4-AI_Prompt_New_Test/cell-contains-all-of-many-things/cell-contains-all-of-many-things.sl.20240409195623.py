Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Input Column Summary:

The input data consists of two distinct parts:

1. **Sentences/Phrases**: The first part of each input is a sentence or phrase that describes a scene or setting, often incorporating various colors and objects. These sentences are rich in imagery, involving elements like animals (e.g., dogs), objects (e.g., frisbie), and settings (e.g., grass, sand, field, neon sign). The descriptions are varied, covering both natural scenes (e.g., grass, sand, field) and man-made elements (e.g., neon sign).

2. **Keywords**: Following the descriptive sentence or phrase, there are a series of keywords. These keywords are consistent across the inputs, including colors ('yellow', 'green') and an object or animal ('dog'). These keywords seem to be the focal points for evaluating the sentences.

### Output Column Summary:

The output data is binary, represented by boolean values `true` or `false`. The output indicates whether a certain condition or set of conditions is met within the sentences provided in the input data. Specifically, the output is `true` when all the keywords listed (colors and the object/animal) are present in the descriptive sentence or phrase. Conversely, the output is `false` when at least one of the keywords is missing from the description.

### Relationship Summary:

The relationship between the input and output data hinges on the presence of specific keywords within the descriptive sentences or phrases. The output is determined by a simple rule: if the sentence or phrase contains all the keywords listed after it (both the colors and the object/animal), the output is `true`. If any of the keywords are missing from the sentence, the output is `false`.

This relationship showcases a straightforward pattern matching or keyword detection task, where the objective is to verify the inclusion of certain elements within a textual description. The task does not require understanding the context or the semantics of the sentence beyond identifying the presence of the specified keywords. The simplicity of the rule makes it a clear-cut case of binary classification based on textual content analysis., and input as ['yellow dog on green grass', 'yellow', 'green', 'dog'] output is true, input as ['Lone dog with a green frisbie on yellow sand', 'yellow', 'green', 'dog'] output is true, input as ['A yellow sun in a green field', 'yellow', 'green', 'dog'] output is false, input as ['yellow neon sign with a green background', 'yellow', 'green', 'dog'] output is false, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
