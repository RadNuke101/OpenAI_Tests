Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Input Column Summary:

The input data consists of strings that represent specific dates, with most entries following a standard format of "[Month] [Day] [Year]". Some entries include additional descriptive elements, such as the naming or establishment of a township, indicated by phrases like "as Delaware Township" or within angle brackets "<as Raritan Township>". These additional elements provide context but are not consistent across all entries. The dates span from the early 18th century to the late 19th century, indicating a historical context for the data. The months mentioned are varied, including January, February, March, April, July, and others, showing no specific pattern or concentration in a particular season or part of the year. The days mentioned range from early in the month (e.g., 1st, 5th) to later (e.g., 28th), with no clear preference for any specific part of the month.

### Output Column Summary:

The output data consists of four-digit numbers, each representing a year extracted from the corresponding input string. These years range from the early 18th century (1721) to the late 19th century (1892), aligning with the historical context suggested by the input data. The output data is numerical and focuses solely on the year component of the input data, disregarding month, day, and any additional descriptive text included in some entries.

### Relationship Summary:

The relationship between the input and output data is straightforward: the output is derived directly from the input by extracting the year component of the date mentioned in each input string. The process of deriving the output ignores all other elements of the input, such as the month, day, and any additional descriptive context related to township names or establishment details. This extraction process highlights a focus on the chronological aspect of the input data, specifically the year, which may be of particular relevance to the context or analysis for which this data is intended. The presence of additional descriptive elements in some input entries suggests that while the primary interest is in the year, the full input strings may carry historical or geographical significance that is not captured in the output data., and input as ['April 1 1799'] output is 1799, input as ['April 11 1867'] output is 1867, input as ['February 12 1806'] output is 1806, input as ['February 21 1798'] output is 1798, input as ['February 28 1844 as Delaware Township'] output is 1844, input as ['February 5 1798'] output is 1798, input as ['February 7 1892 Verona Township'] output is 1892, input as ['February 9 1797'] output is 1797, input as ['January 19 1748'] output is 1748, input as ['July 10 1721 as Upper Penns Neck Township'] output is 1721, input as ['March 15 1860'] output is 1860, input as ['March 17 1870 <as Raritan Township>'] output is 1870, input as ['March 17 1874'] output is 1874, input as ['March 23 1864'] output is 1864, input as ['March 5 1867'] output is 1867, input as ['April 28th 1828'] output is 1828, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
