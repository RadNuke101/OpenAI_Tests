Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Summary of Input Column Data:

The input data consists of strings representing phone numbers in a specific format. Each string begins with a '+' sign, followed by a country code (one or more digits), a space, and then the local number divided into three groups by hyphens. The country codes vary in length, ranging from one to three digits, indicating that the phone numbers originate from various countries. The local number groups are consistently separated by hyphens, suggesting a standardized format within the input data. The presence of the '+' sign indicates an international format. The data is qualitative, representing phone numbers as a form of identification or contact information rather than numerical values to be calculated.

### Summary of Output Column Data:

The output data transforms the input phone numbers into a different format. The transformation involves removing the space and hyphens from the input and replacing them with periods. The '+' sign is omitted, and the country code is directly followed by the local number groups, now separated by periods instead of hyphens. This results in a continuous string of digits and periods, maintaining the distinction between the country code and the local number groups. The output format is more streamlined and uniform, suggesting a possible preference for a specific data handling or display context where spaces and hyphens are less desirable.

### Relationship Between Input and Output:

The transformation from the input to the output format represents a standardization process, converting phone numbers from a more visually segmented international format to a compact, period-separated format. This process retains all numerical information while altering separators for consistency or compatibility with certain systems or standards. The relationship between the input and output data highlights a formatting preference or requirement, possibly aimed at simplifying data processing or presentation. The consistent use of periods as separators in the output suggests a specific aesthetic or functional rationale, such as ease of reading, database storage, or application input requirements. The transformation does not alter the inherent qualitative nature of the data; it remains a representation of phone numbers, merely presented in a different visual format., and input as ['+106 769-858-438'] output is 106.769.858.438, input as ['+83 973-757-831'] output is 83.973.757.831, input as ['+62 647-787-775'] output is 62.647.787.775, input as ['+172 027-507-632'] output is 172.027.507.632, input as ['+72 001-050-856'] output is 72.001.050.856, input as ['+95 310-537-401'] output is 95.310.537.401, input as ['+6 775-969-238'] output is 6.775.969.238, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
