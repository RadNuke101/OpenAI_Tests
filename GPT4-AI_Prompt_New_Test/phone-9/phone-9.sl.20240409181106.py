Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Summary of Input Column Data

The input data consists of strings representing phone numbers in a specific format. Each entry begins with a '+' sign, followed by a country code (which can vary in length), a space, and then the phone number itself divided into three groups by hyphens. The country code ranges from one to three digits, indicating a variety of geographical origins. The phone numbers are consistently formatted with three groups of digits, although the total number of digits in these groups can vary slightly. This format suggests an international context, with the numbers likely representing a diverse set of locations around the world.

### Summary of Output Column Data

The output data retains the same essential information as the input data but is reformatted. The '+' sign is removed, and the space following the country code is replaced with a period. Additionally, the hyphens separating the groups of digits in the phone number are also replaced with periods. This results in a uniform separation of all parts of the phone number by periods, creating a consistent and streamlined appearance. The transformation from the input format to the output format simplifies the visual representation of the phone numbers, possibly making them easier to read or process in certain contexts.

### Relationship Between Input and Output

The transformation from the input to the output data involves a systematic reformatting process that affects the separators within the phone numbers but leaves the numerical content unchanged. The '+' sign is removed entirely, likely because the output format assumes the international context is understood or irrelevant for the intended use. The space after the country code and the hyphens within the phone number are uniformly replaced with periods, standardizing the separation of all parts of the phone number. This process suggests a desire to maintain the integrity of the original information while adapting its presentation to a format that might be preferred for aesthetic, practical, or technical reasons. The consistent application of this transformation across a variety of phone numbers indicates a rule-based approach to formatting, which could be easily automated or applied as a standard procedure in data processing or communication systems., and input as ['+106 769-858-438'] output is 106.769.858.438, input as ['+83 973-757-831'] output is 83.973.757.831, input as ['+62 647-787-775'] output is 62.647.787.775, input as ['+172 027-507-632'] output is 172.027.507.632, input as ['+72 001-050-856'] output is 72.001.050.856, input as ['+95 310-537-401'] output is 95.310.537.401, input as ['+6 775-969-238'] output is 6.775.969.238, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
