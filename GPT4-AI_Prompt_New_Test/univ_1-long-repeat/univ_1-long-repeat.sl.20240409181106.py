Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Summary for Input Column Data:

The input data consists of two columns, each representing distinct but related pieces of information about various educational institutions. The first column contains the names of universities or colleges, which range from well-known public and private institutions to more specialized or less widely recognized schools. These names include both formal titles (e.g., "University of Pennsylvania") and commonly used abbreviations or nicknames (e.g., "UCLA" for the University of California, Los Angeles). The second column provides the geographical location of each institution, specified with varying degrees of detail. Some entries include just the city and state (e.g., "Berkeley, CA"), while others also include the country (e.g., "Ithaca, New York, USA"), catering to a broader recognition that these institutions attract a global audience. The locations are primarily in the United States, covering a wide geographic spread from the East Coast to the West Coast, including major cities and smaller towns known primarily for hosting these institutions.

### Summary for Output Column Data:

The output data combines the information from the two input columns into a single, cohesive string for each institution. This amalgamation provides a more complete picture of each university or college by directly associating its name with its geographical location. The format consistently places the institution's name first, followed by a comma and then the location, maintaining uniformity across entries. This combined format enhances the utility of the information, making it immediately clear where each institution is based without sacrificing the distinct identity provided by its name. The output serves as a concise reference that could be particularly useful in contexts where both the identity and location of an institution are relevant, such as academic research, student applications, or in discussions about higher education.

### Relationship Between Input and Output:

The relationship between the input and output columns is a transformational one, where the output synthesizes the separate pieces of information provided in the input into a single, streamlined format. This transformation facilitates easier consumption and understanding of the data by providing a direct link between each institution and its geographical context. The process respects the original data's integrity, ensuring that the unique characteristics of each entry, such as the presence or absence of the country in the location, are preserved in the combined output. This method of data presentation underscores the importance of both the identity and location of educational institutions, acknowledging that each aspect contributes to the institution's overall profile and recognition., and input as ['UC Berkeley', 'Berkeley, CA'] output is UC Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, input as ['University of Pennsylvania', 'Phialdelphia, PA, USA'] output is University of Pennsylvania, Phialdelphia, PA, USA, input as ['UCLA', 'Los Angeles, CA'] output is UCLA, Los Angeles, CA, input as ['Cornell University', 'Ithaca, New York, USA'] output is Cornell University, Ithaca, New York, USA, input as ['Penn', 'Philadelphia, PA, USA'] output is Penn, Philadelphia, PA, USA, input as ['University of Michigan', 'Ann Arbor, MI, USA'] output is University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA, input as ['UC Berkeley', 'Berkeley, CA'] output is UC Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, input as ['MIT', 'Cambridge, MA'] output is MIT, Cambridge, MA, input as ['University of Pennsylvania', 'Phialdelphia, PA, USA'] output is University of Pennsylvania, Phialdelphia, PA, USA, input as ['UCLA', 'Los Angeles, CA'] output is UCLA, Los Angeles, CA, input as ['University of Maryland College Park', 'College Park, MD'] output is University of Maryland College Park, College Park, MD, input as ['University of Michigan', 'Ann Arbor, MI, USA'] output is University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA, input as ['UC Berkeley', 'Berkeley, CA'] output is UC Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, input as ['MIT', 'Cambridge, MA'] output is MIT, Cambridge, MA, input as ['Rice University', 'Houston, TX'] output is Rice University, Houston, TX, input as ['Yale University', 'New Haven, CT, USA'] output is Yale University, New Haven, CT, USA, input as ['Columbia University', 'New York, NY, USA'] output is Columbia University, New York, NY, USA, input as ['NYU', 'New York, New York, USA'] output is NYU, New York, New York, USA, input as ['Drexel University', 'Philadelphia, PA'] output is Drexel University, Philadelphia, PA, input as ['UC Berkeley', 'Berkeley, CA'] output is UC Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, input as ['UIUC', 'Urbana, IL'] output is UIUC, Urbana, IL, input as ['Temple University', 'Philadelphia, PA'] output is Temple University, Philadelphia, PA, input as ['Harvard University', 'Cambridge, MA, USA'] output is Harvard University, Cambridge, MA, USA, input as ['University of Connecticut', 'Storrs, CT, USA'] output is University of Connecticut, Storrs, CT, USA, input as ['Drexel University', 'Philadelphia, PA'] output is Drexel University, Philadelphia, PA, input as ['NYU', 'New York, New York, USA'] output is NYU, New York, New York, USA, input as ['UIUC', 'Urbana, IL'] output is UIUC, Urbana, IL, input as ['New Haven University', 'New Haven, CT, USA'] output is New Haven University, New Haven, CT, USA, input as ['University of California, Santa Barbara', 'Santa Barbara, CA, USA'] output is University of California, Santa Barbara, Santa Barbara, CA, USA, input as ['University of Connecticut', 'Storrs, CT, USA'] output is University of Connecticut, Storrs, CT, USA, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
