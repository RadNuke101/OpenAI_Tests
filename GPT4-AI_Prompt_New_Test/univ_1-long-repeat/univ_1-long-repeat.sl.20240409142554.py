Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Input Column Summary:

The input data consists of two distinct columns, each containing qualitative information about various universities and their respective locations. The first column provides the names of the universities, which include a mix of abbreviations (e.g., "UCLA", "MIT", "NYU", "UIUC") and full names (e.g., "University of Pennsylvania", "Cornell University", "Harvard University"). These names represent a diverse set of institutions, ranging from public universities (e.g., "University of Michigan", "University of California, Santa Barbara") to private institutions (e.g., "Yale University", "Columbia University").

The second column specifies the geographical locations of these universities, presented in a format that typically includes the city and state, and in some cases, the country (e.g., "Berkeley, CA", "Ann Arbor, MI, USA", "New York, New York, USA"). The locations cover a wide geographical area, primarily within the United States, indicating a focus on American higher education institutions. The format of the location data varies slightly, with some entries including additional details like the country, especially for locations that might be less immediately recognizable to an international audience.

### Output Column Summary:

The output data combines the information provided in the two input columns into a single, cohesive string for each university, formatted as "University Name, Location". This format maintains the original information while presenting it in a more integrated and reader-friendly manner. The output strings are consistent in their structure, ensuring that the name of the institution is followed by its geographical location, separated by a comma. This approach facilitates easier identification and reference to the specific universities and their locations in a concise format. The output retains the original spelling and formatting of the input data, including any abbreviations or variations in the presentation of the location (e.g., inclusion of the country).

### Relationship Summary:

The relationship between the input and output data is a transformation process that merges two separate pieces of qualitative information (university name and location) into a single, unified format. This process enhances the readability and utility of the data by providing a straightforward, combined reference for each institution's name and geographical location. The transformation does not alter the original content but restructures it to create a more accessible and informative presentation. This summary format is particularly useful for contexts where a quick identification of both the institution and its location is required, serving various informational, academic, or administrative purposes., and input as ['UC Berkeley', 'Berkeley, CA'] output is UC Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, input as ['University of Pennsylvania', 'Phialdelphia, PA, USA'] output is University of Pennsylvania, Phialdelphia, PA, USA, input as ['UCLA', 'Los Angeles, CA'] output is UCLA, Los Angeles, CA, input as ['Cornell University', 'Ithaca, New York, USA'] output is Cornell University, Ithaca, New York, USA, input as ['Penn', 'Philadelphia, PA, USA'] output is Penn, Philadelphia, PA, USA, input as ['University of Michigan', 'Ann Arbor, MI, USA'] output is University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA, input as ['UC Berkeley', 'Berkeley, CA'] output is UC Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, input as ['MIT', 'Cambridge, MA'] output is MIT, Cambridge, MA, input as ['University of Pennsylvania', 'Phialdelphia, PA, USA'] output is University of Pennsylvania, Phialdelphia, PA, USA, input as ['UCLA', 'Los Angeles, CA'] output is UCLA, Los Angeles, CA, input as ['University of Maryland College Park', 'College Park, MD'] output is University of Maryland College Park, College Park, MD, input as ['University of Michigan', 'Ann Arbor, MI, USA'] output is University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA, input as ['UC Berkeley', 'Berkeley, CA'] output is UC Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, input as ['MIT', 'Cambridge, MA'] output is MIT, Cambridge, MA, input as ['Rice University', 'Houston, TX'] output is Rice University, Houston, TX, input as ['Yale University', 'New Haven, CT, USA'] output is Yale University, New Haven, CT, USA, input as ['Columbia University', 'New York, NY, USA'] output is Columbia University, New York, NY, USA, input as ['NYU', 'New York, New York, USA'] output is NYU, New York, New York, USA, input as ['Drexel University', 'Philadelphia, PA'] output is Drexel University, Philadelphia, PA, input as ['UC Berkeley', 'Berkeley, CA'] output is UC Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, input as ['UIUC', 'Urbana, IL'] output is UIUC, Urbana, IL, input as ['Temple University', 'Philadelphia, PA'] output is Temple University, Philadelphia, PA, input as ['Harvard University', 'Cambridge, MA, USA'] output is Harvard University, Cambridge, MA, USA, input as ['University of Connecticut', 'Storrs, CT, USA'] output is University of Connecticut, Storrs, CT, USA, input as ['Drexel University', 'Philadelphia, PA'] output is Drexel University, Philadelphia, PA, input as ['NYU', 'New York, New York, USA'] output is NYU, New York, New York, USA, input as ['UIUC', 'Urbana, IL'] output is UIUC, Urbana, IL, input as ['New Haven University', 'New Haven, CT, USA'] output is New Haven University, New Haven, CT, USA, input as ['University of California, Santa Barbara', 'Santa Barbara, CA, USA'] output is University of California, Santa Barbara, Santa Barbara, CA, USA, input as ['University of Connecticut', 'Storrs, CT, USA'] output is University of Connecticut, Storrs, CT, USA, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
