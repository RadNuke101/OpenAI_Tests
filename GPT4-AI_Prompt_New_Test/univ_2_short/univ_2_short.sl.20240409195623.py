Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Input Column Summary:

The input data consists of two columns, each representing a distinct but related piece of information about various educational institutions. The first column contains the names of universities or colleges, which vary from well-known large institutions like the "University of Pennsylvania" and "UCLA" to others like "Cornell University" and "University of Michigan". These names indicate a diverse set of prestigious institutions across the United States, highlighting a focus on higher education establishments of significant repute.

The second column provides geographical details associated with each institution listed in the first column. These details include the city and state where the institution is located, and in some cases, the country (USA) is explicitly mentioned. Locations span across various states such as Pennsylvania (PA), California (CA), New York, Maryland (MD), and Michigan (MI), indicating a geographical diversity that covers both coasts and the interior of the United States. The inclusion of the city, state, and sometimes country, underscores the importance of the geographical context to the identity and recognition of each institution.

### Output Column Summary:

The output data combines the information provided in the two input columns into a single, cohesive string for each institution. This output format maintains the original order of information, starting with the institution's name followed by its geographical location, including the city, state, and when not originally provided, the country (USA) is appended to ensure consistency and clarity. The output strings such as "University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA" and "UCLA, Los Angeles, CA, USA" offer a complete and standardized identification for each institution, making it easier to recognize and understand the institution's name in conjunction with its geographical setting. This format is particularly useful for contexts where a full, descriptive identification of each institution is required.

### Relationship Summary:

The transformation from the input columns to the output column demonstrates a process of data standardization and enrichment. By merging the institution names with their respective geographical details into a single output string and appending "USA" where necessary, the process ensures that each entry is presented in a consistent, comprehensive format. This not only enhances the readability and utility of the data but also emphasizes the significance of both the educational institution's name and its location as integral components of its identity. The relationship between the input and output underscores the value of structured, detailed information in educational, geographical, and potentially administrative contexts, facilitating clearer communication and understanding of the institutions involved., and input as ['University of Pennsylvania', 'Phialdelphia, PA, USA'] output is University of Pennsylvania, Phialdelphia, PA, USA, input as ['UCLA', 'Los Angeles, CA'] output is UCLA, Los Angeles, CA, USA, input as ['Cornell University', 'Ithaca, New York, USA'] output is Cornell University, Ithaca, New York, USA, input as ['Penn', 'Philadelphia, PA, USA'] output is Penn, Philadelphia, PA, USA, input as ['University of Maryland College Park', 'College Park, MD'] output is University of Maryland College Park, College Park, MD, USA, input as ['University of Michigan', 'Ann Arbor, MI, USA'] output is University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.

def generated_function(institution_name, location):
    """
    This function takes the name of an educational institution and its geographical location as inputs,
    and returns a single string that combines both pieces of information. If the location does not end with 'USA',
    it appends ', USA' to ensure consistency and clarity in the output.
    
    Parameters:
    institution_name (str): The name of the educational institution.
    location (str): The geographical location of the institution, including city and state, and optionally the country.
    
    Returns:
    str: A single string combining the institution's name and location, with 'USA' appended if not already present.
