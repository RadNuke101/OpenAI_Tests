Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Summary of Input Column Data:

The input data represents a variety of operating system versions from different vendors, including but not limited to AIX, VMware, Linux, Red Hat Enterprise, Microsoft Windows, and their respective versions. The data is presented in a string format that includes the operating system name, version number, and in some cases, additional details such as build numbers, specific updates, or configurations (e.g., "build-110268", "<2.6-78.0.13.ELlargesmp>"). These strings vary significantly in structure, with some providing straightforward version information ("AIX 5.1") and others embedding the version number within a more complex string ("Red Hat Enterprise AS 4 <2.6-78.0.13.ELlargesmp>"). The diversity in the format of these strings indicates a need for parsing or extracting relevant version information from a mix of alphanumeric characters and symbols.

### Summary of Output Column Data:

The output data consistently presents the major and minor version numbers of the operating systems mentioned in the input data, formatted as a decimal number (e.g., "5.1", "3.5", "2.6", "1.0", "6.1"). This output simplifies the version information from the input data, focusing solely on the version numbers that are most relevant for identifying the specific release of the operating system. The output disregards additional details such as build numbers, configurations, or updates, providing a clean and concise representation of the operating system version.

### Relationship Between Input and Output:

The relationship between the input and output data is a process of extraction and simplification, where the complex and varied string inputs containing operating system names and version details are distilled down to the essential version numbers (major and minor) in a standardized decimal format. This process involves identifying and isolating the version numbers from a diverse set of string formats, demonstrating the need for flexible parsing strategies that can accommodate the differences in how operating system versions are presented. The output serves as a streamlined and uniform representation of operating system versions, facilitating easier comparison, sorting, or categorization based on version numbers alone, without the clutter of additional textual or numerical details found in the input., and input as ['AIX 5.1'] output is 5.1, input as ['VMware ESX Server 3.5.0 build-110268'] output is 3.5, input as ['Linux Linux 2.6 Linux'] output is 2.6, input as ['Red Hat Enterprise AS 4 <2.6-78.0.13.ELlargesmp>'] output is 2.6, input as ['Microsoft <R> Windows <R> 2000 Advanced Server 1.0'] output is 1.0, input as ['Microsoft Windows XP Win2008R2 6.1.7601'] output is 6.1, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
