Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Summary of Input Column Data:

The input data consists of two columns. The first column contains full names of individuals, each entry following the format of a first name followed by a last name, with a space separating the two. These names appear to be of diverse origins, indicating a wide range of backgrounds. The second column contains email addresses or identifiers that seem to be uniquely constructed by combining elements of the individual's name with additional characters and a domain name. The structure of these identifiers varies but often includes parts of the individual's name, underscores, and sometimes additional words or letters before the domain suffix. The domain names themselves are not standard .com or .org addresses but are unique and seem to be fabricated for this context.

### Summary of Output Column Data:

The output data consists of a single column that extracts and presents the domain part of the email addresses or identifiers provided in the second column of the input data. These domain names are stripped of any preceding elements related to the individual's name or additional characters that were part of the identifier. The output focuses solely on the domain, which includes both the unique domain name and the top-level domain (TLD), but excludes any subdomains or paths. The domains are varied and do not follow a single pattern, indicating no specific geographical or organizational affiliation.

### Relationship Between Input and Output:

The relationship between the input and output data is a process of extraction and simplification, where the complex and personalized identifiers in the input are distilled down to their domain components in the output. This process involves identifying and removing the parts of the identifiers that are personalized or extraneous to the domain name itself, such as the individual's name or additional characters used for separation or decoration. The output represents a cleaner, more standardized form of the data that highlights the domain aspect of the identifiers, making it easier to see patterns or categorize the data based on domain names alone. This transformation from a personalized and varied identifier to a standardized domain name underscores the focus on the internet domain aspect of the identifiers, stripping away the individual personalization to reveal the underlying domain structure., and input as ['ann chang', 'achang_maaker.com'] output is maaker.com, input as ['bobby smith', 'bobt_sphynx.uk.co'] output is sphynx.uk.co, input as ['art lennox', 'art.lennox_svxn.com'] output is svxn.com, input as ['smith bagshaw', 'smith_bbbbb.com'] output is bbbbb.com, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
