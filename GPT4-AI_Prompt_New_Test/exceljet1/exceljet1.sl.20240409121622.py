Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Input Column Summary:

The input data consists of two columns. The first column contains full names, which are made up of first and last names separated by a space. These names appear to be of individuals, with a diverse set of names indicating no specific pattern or restriction on nationality or origin. The second column contains email addresses or identifiers that seem to be related to the individuals named in the first column. These identifiers are not standard email addresses but appear to follow a unique format where the individual's name or a part of it is somehow incorporated, followed by an underscore or a period, and then a sequence that seems unrelated to the actual name. This sequence after the underscore or period is what appears to be extracted or relevant for the output.

### Output Column Summary:

The output data consists of a single column that extracts a specific part from the second input column. This part always comes after an underscore or a period in the input and represents a domain-like string, although not necessarily a conventional domain name. The output strings retain the dot notation, suggesting a domain or subdomain structure, but the 'names' themselves do not always follow typical domain naming conventions. This output seems to represent a simplified or essential identifier extracted from a more complex identifier given in the input.

### Relationship Summary:

The relationship between the input and output data is based on a pattern of extraction where the output is derived from the second column of the input. Specifically, the output captures the portion of the string that follows an underscore or a period in the second input column. This suggests a systematic method of identifying and extracting a domain-like component from a larger, more complex identifier. The first column (names) does not directly influence the output but provides context, suggesting that the second column's identifiers are personalized or related to the individuals named in the first column. The extraction process ignores the personalization part of the identifier (i.e., the part of the string that directly relates to the individual's name) and focuses on the latter part, which could represent a domain, organization, or other forms of identifiers not directly tied to the individual's real name., and input as ['ann chang', 'achang_maaker.com'] output is maaker.com, input as ['bobby smith', 'bobt_sphynx.uk.co'] output is sphynx.uk.co, input as ['art lennox', 'art.lennox_svxn.com'] output is svxn.com, input as ['smith bagshaw', 'smith_bbbbb.com'] output is bbbbb.com, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
