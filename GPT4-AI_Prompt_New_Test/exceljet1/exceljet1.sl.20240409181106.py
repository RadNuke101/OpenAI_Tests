Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Summary for Input Column Data:

The input data consists of two columns, each containing qualitative information. The first column includes full names, which are composed of a first name and a last name, separated by a space. These names appear to be of diverse origins and are structured in a conventional Western naming format. The second column contains email-like strings that do not follow standard email formatting. Instead, these strings seem to represent a unique identifier or username followed by an underscore and then what appears to be a domain name. The domain names do not include traditional email service providers but seem to be more arbitrary or customized. There is a pattern where the unique identifier or username part of the string in the second column often contains a portion of the name from the first column, suggesting a personalized or derived relationship between the name and the identifier.

### Summary for Output Column Data:

The output data consists of domain-like strings extracted from the second column of the input data. These strings do not include traditional top-level domains (TLDs) in some cases and instead present a mix of real and possibly fictional TLDs. The output strings are characterized by their variability in structure and composition, ranging from more conventional domain names to those that seem highly customized or unique. The extraction process appears to focus on isolating the portion of the string after the underscore character in the second input column, indicating a method of deriving the output from the input data based on a specific pattern.

### Relationship Between Input and Output:

The relationship between the input and output data is defined by a transformation process that extracts a specific portion of the second column of the input data. This process identifies and isolates the domain-like string that follows an underscore character in the second column. The transformation disregards the unique identifier or username preceding the underscore and any standard email formatting, focusing solely on what appears to be a domain name. This suggests a systematic approach to deriving a simplified or essential piece of information (the domain-like string) from a more complex and personalized input (the email-like string). The presence of portions of the names from the first column in the unique identifiers of the second column hints at a personalized or derived connection between the individual's name and their associated domain-like string, although this connection is not directly reflected in the output data. The output, therefore, represents a distilled form of the input, focusing on the domain aspect while abstracting away from personal identifiers and unconventional formatting., and input as ['ann chang', 'achang_maaker.com'] output is maaker.com, input as ['bobby smith', 'bobt_sphynx.uk.co'] output is sphynx.uk.co, input as ['art lennox', 'art.lennox_svxn.com'] output is svxn.com, input as ['smith bagshaw', 'smith_bbbbb.com'] output is bbbbb.com, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
