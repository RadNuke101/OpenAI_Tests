Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Input Column Summary:

The input data represents a collection of strings that describe various industries or activities, often followed by a country code (e.g., "US" for the United States, "CAN" for Canada). These strings are qualitative in nature and provide information about the type of industry or activity, such as "Mining," "Soybean Farming," "Oil Extraction," and "Fishing." The presence of a country code indicates a geographical specificity to the activity, suggesting that the data might be used to analyze or compare industry activities across different regions. However, not all entries include a country code, indicating that some data points are more general or not region-specific.

### Output Column Summary:

The output data consists of strings that describe industries or activities without any geographical identifiers. This output retains the qualitative nature of the input data but removes any regional specificity. The output focuses solely on the type of industry or activity, such as "Mining," "Soybean Farming," "Oil Extraction," and "Fishing." This suggests a generalization or abstraction step from the input data, where the primary interest lies in identifying the nature of the activity without tying it to a specific location.

### Relationship Between Input and Output:

The relationship between the input and output data is characterized by a process of abstraction or generalization, where the output retains the industry or activity information from the input but removes geographical identifiers. This transformation suggests that the purpose of the output is to focus on the type of industry or activity itself, rather than its geographical context. This could be useful in contexts where the analysis or application requires understanding or categorizing types of industries or activities without needing to differentiate based on location. The process effectively categorizes or groups activities into broader categories, making it easier to analyze or work with the data in contexts where regional specificity is not required. This relationship indicates a structured approach to data processing, where specific attributes (in this case, geographical identifiers) are selectively removed to meet the analytical or operational needs of the user or system., and input as ['Mining US'] output is Mining, input as ['Soybean Farming CAN'] output is Soybean Farming, input as ['Soybean Farming'] output is Soybean Farming, input as ['Oil Extraction US'] output is Oil Extraction, input as ['Fishing'] output is Fishing, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
