Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Input Column Summary:

The input data consists of strings that describe various industries or activities, often followed by a geographical identifier (such as "US" for the United States or "CAN" for Canada). These industries or activities include, but are not limited to, "Mining," "Soybean Farming," "Oil Extraction," and "Fishing." The geographical identifier, when present, specifies the location where the activity is primarily taking place. However, not all entries include a geographical identifier, indicating that some activities are mentioned in a more general context without specifying a location.

### Output Column Summary:

The output data retains the industry or activity descriptions from the input data but omits any geographical identifiers. This results in a more generalized categorization of the activities or industries, focusing solely on the nature of the activity itself without regard to where it is taking place. The output includes terms like "Mining," "Soybean Farming," "Oil Extraction," and "Fishing," which correspond directly to the activities mentioned in the input data, stripped of any location-specific information.

### Relationship Summary:

The transformation from the input to the output data involves the extraction and isolation of the core activity or industry description from the input strings, effectively removing any geographical context. This process highlights the primary focus on the type of activity or industry itself, rather than its location. The relationship between the input and output data demonstrates a filtering mechanism that distills the essence of each entry into its most fundamental component—the activity or industry—thereby facilitating a more streamlined and location-agnostic categorization of the data. This approach allows for a broader analysis and understanding of the activities or industries mentioned, independent of their geographical occurrence., and input as ['Mining US'] output is Mining, input as ['Soybean Farming CAN'] output is Soybean Farming, input as ['Soybean Farming'] output is Soybean Farming, input as ['Oil Extraction US'] output is Oil Extraction, input as ['Fishing'] output is Fishing, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
