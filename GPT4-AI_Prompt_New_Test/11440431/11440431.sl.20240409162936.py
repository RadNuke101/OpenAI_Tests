Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Summary of Input Column Data

The input data represents a collection of strings that describe various industries or activities, often followed by a geographical identifier (e.g., "US" for the United States, "CAN" for Canada). These industries or activities include, but are not limited to, mining, soybean farming, oil extraction, and fishing. The geographical identifier indicates the country where the activity is primarily taking place. However, not all entries have a geographical identifier, suggesting that some activities are considered without a specific geographical context. The input data is qualitative, focusing on the type of industry or activity rather than any quantitative measures associated with it.

### Summary of Output Column Data

The output data extracts and presents the industry or activity component from the input data, excluding any geographical identifiers. This results in a cleaner, more focused representation of the type of industry or activity being described, without specifying where it is taking place. The output data retains the qualitative nature of the input, emphasizing the nature of the activity or industry without delving into any quantitative aspects.

### Relationship Between Input and Output

The relationship between the input and output data is a process of simplification and focus, where the output distills the essence of the input by removing geographical identifiers. This transformation highlights the type of activity or industry being discussed, making it the central point of interest. The removal of geographical identifiers in the output suggests that the specific location of these activities is not the primary focus of this dataset's intended analysis or usage. Instead, the emphasis is on understanding or cataloging the variety of industries or activities themselves, irrespective of their geographical occurrence. This approach allows for a broader discussion or analysis of these industries or activities without being constrained by regional specifics., and input as ['Mining US'] output is Mining, input as ['Soybean Farming CAN'] output is Soybean Farming, input as ['Soybean Farming'] output is Soybean Farming, input as ['Oil Extraction US'] output is Oil Extraction, input as ['Fishing'] output is Fishing, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
