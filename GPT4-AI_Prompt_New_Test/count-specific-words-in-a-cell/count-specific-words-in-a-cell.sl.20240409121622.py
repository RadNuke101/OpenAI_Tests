Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Summary of Input Column Data

The input data consists of two columns, where the first column contains sentences, and the second column specifies a substring or a pattern to be identified within the sentences from the first column. The sentences provided in the examples are identical across the inputs: "The fox jumped over the fox". The patterns to be identified vary across the inputs, including "fox", "ox", and "Fox". This variation in the second column directly influences the output, as it determines the criteria for counting occurrences within the given sentence. The patterns vary in terms of their characters and case sensitivity, which plays a crucial role in identifying occurrences.

### Summary of Output Column Data

The output data is a single column that represents the count of occurrences of the specified pattern (from the second input column) within the sentence (from the first input column). The outputs provided in the examples are numerical values: 2, 2, and 0. These values correspond to the number of times the specified pattern is found within the sentence. The output directly correlates with the specificity and case sensitivity of the pattern provided in the second input column.

### Relationship Between Input and Output

The relationship between the input and output columns is defined by the pattern matching process, where the output is determined by counting the occurrences of the specified pattern (second input column) within the given sentence (first input column). The key observations regarding this relationship are:

1. **Case Sensitivity**: The pattern's case sensitivity significantly affects the output. For example, searching for "fox" (lowercase) yields a different result compared to "Fox" (uppercase), indicating that the search is case-sensitive and thus affects the count of occurrences.

2. **Pattern Specificity**: The specificity of the pattern also influences the output. A more general pattern (e.g., "ox") can match more broadly within the sentence, potentially leading to a higher count of occurrences compared to a more specific pattern (e.g., "fox").

3. **Direct Correlation**: There is a direct correlation between the pattern specified and the output count. The output is entirely dependent on how many times the specified pattern is found within the sentence, demonstrating a straightforward relationship between the pattern identification process and the numerical output.

In summary, the relationship between the input columns and the output column is governed by the process of pattern matching, where the output (count of occurrences) is directly influenced by the characteristics (case sensitivity and specificity) of the pattern specified in the second input column., and input as ['The fox jumped over the fox', 'fox'] output is 2, input as ['The fox jumped over the fox', 'ox'] output is 2, input as ['The fox jumped over the fox', 'Fox'] output is 0, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
