Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Summary of Input Column Data

The input data consists of two columns. The first column contains sentences, while the second column contains specific substrings or words to be identified within the sentences from the first column. The sentences in the first column are textual data, and the substrings in the second column are also textual but serve as the criteria for analysis within the sentences. The examples provided indicate that the sentences may contain repetitions of the substrings of interest. The substrings to be identified vary in their characteristics, including length and case sensitivity. The examples show that the search for substrings does not ignore case by default, as the presence of the same word with different cases (e.g., "fox" vs. "Fox") yields different counts.

### Summary of Output Column Data

The output data is numerical, representing the count of occurrences of the specified substring within the given sentence. The counts vary based on the presence and frequency of the specified substring within each sentence. The output demonstrates that the counting mechanism is case-sensitive, as identical substrings with different cases are counted separately. The numerical output is directly related to the second column of the input data, indicating a clear relationship between the specified substring and its frequency within the sentence.

### Relationship Between Input and Output

The relationship between the input and output data is defined by the task of counting occurrences of a specified substring within a given sentence. The output is directly influenced by two main factors from the input data: the content of the sentence and the specific substring to be identified. The frequency of the specified substring within the sentence determines the numerical output. This task highlights the importance of exact matches, including case sensitivity, in determining the count of occurrences. The relationship underscores the analytical process of text analysis, specifically the counting of specific textual elements within larger textual contexts., and input as ['The fox jumped over the fox', 'fox'] output is 2, input as ['The fox jumped over the fox', 'ox'] output is 2, input as ['The fox jumped over the fox', 'Fox'] output is 0, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
