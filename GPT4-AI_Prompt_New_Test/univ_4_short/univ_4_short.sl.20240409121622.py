Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Summary for Input Column Data:

The input data consists of two primary columns, each representing different aspects of information related to various universities and their locations in the United States. The first column contains the names of the universities, which include a mix of full university names (e.g., "University of Pennsylvania," "Cornell University") and abbreviations or informal names (e.g., "UCLA," "Penn"). This variety indicates a flexibility in how institutions are referred to, encompassing both formal designations and colloquial or widely recognized abbreviations.

The second column provides the geographical locations associated with these universities. These locations are presented with varying degrees of detail, from more comprehensive addresses that include the city, state, and country (e.g., "Philadelphia, PA, USA") to more abbreviated forms that might omit the country or use a less formal state abbreviation (e.g., "Los Angeles, CA"). This variation suggests an assumption of familiarity with the U.S. context, where the state and city are often deemed sufficient to identify a location, especially for well-known cities or when the context is clear.

### Summary for Output Column Data:

The output data standardizes the format of the university locations provided in the second column of the input data. It ensures consistency in presenting the geographical locations, focusing on a uniform format that includes the city, state abbreviation, and the country ("USA"). This standardization process involves correcting spelling errors (e.g., "Phialdelphia" to "Philadelphia"), standardizing state abbreviations (e.g., "New York" to "NY"), and adding missing country information when absent (e.g., appending ", USA" to "Los Angeles, CA"). The output demonstrates an effort to create a concise, easily understandable format for international and domestic audiences alike, ensuring clarity and uniformity across the dataset.

### Relationship Between Input and Output:

The transformation from input to output data illustrates a process of standardization and error correction aimed at enhancing clarity, consistency, and completeness of the geographical information associated with each university. This process respects the original naming conventions of the universities themselves, whether formal or informal, while ensuring that their locations are presented in a uniform format. The relationship between the input and output underscores the importance of clear, standardized geographical identifiers in educational contexts, facilitating easier recognition and understanding of university locations for a broad audience. This standardization is particularly relevant in a global context, where the precise and consistent presentation of location information can aid in the identification and comparison of institutions., and input as ['University of Pennsylvania', 'Phialdelphia, PA, USA'] output is Phialdelphia, PA, USA, input as ['UCLA', 'Los Angeles, CA'] output is Los Angeles, CA, USA, input as ['Cornell University', 'Ithaca, New York, USA'] output is Ithaca, NY, USA, input as ['Penn', 'Philadelphia, PA, USA'] output is Philadelphia, PA, USA, input as ['University of Maryland College Park', 'College Park, MD'] output is College Park, MD, USA, input as ['University of Michigan', 'Ann Arbor, MI, USA'] output is Ann Arbor, MI, USA, input as ['Columbia University', 'New York, NY, USA'] output is New York, NY, USA, input as ['NYU', 'New York, New York, USA'] output is New York, NY, USA, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
