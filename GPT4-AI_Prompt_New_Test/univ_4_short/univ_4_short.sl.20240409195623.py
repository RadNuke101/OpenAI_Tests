Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Summary of Input Column Data:

The input data consists of two columns, with the first column listing names of universities and the second column providing their corresponding locations. The universities mentioned span a range of prestigious institutions across the United States, including both public and private entities. These institutions are geographically diverse, located in various states such as Pennsylvania, California, New York, Maryland, and Michigan. The names of the universities are sometimes given in their full form (e.g., "University of Pennsylvania") and other times in a more colloquial or abbreviated form (e.g., "UCLA" for University of California, Los Angeles). The locations provided in the second column vary in detail, with some entries including the city, state, and country, while others might omit the country or use a less formal state abbreviation.

### Summary of Output Column Data:

The output data standardizes the format of the university locations mentioned in the input data. It consistently presents the locations in the format of "City, State Abbreviation, USA," ensuring uniformity across all entries. This standardization process involves correcting spelling errors (e.g., "Phialdelphia" to "Philadelphia"), abbreviating state names according to common conventions (e.g., "New York" to "NY"), and adding "USA" to entries where the country was previously omitted, thereby making the geographical context clear and consistent for all listed universities.

### Relationship Between Input and Output:

The transformation from input to output data involves a process of standardization and correction to achieve a uniform representation of university locations across the United States. This process is crucial for enhancing the clarity and consistency of the data, making it more accessible and useful for various applications, such as database management, academic research, or geographical analysis. The relationship between the input and output highlights the importance of data cleaning and normalization in handling qualitative data, especially when dealing with variations in naming conventions and geographical details., and input as ['University of Pennsylvania', 'Phialdelphia, PA, USA'] output is Phialdelphia, PA, USA, input as ['UCLA', 'Los Angeles, CA'] output is Los Angeles, CA, USA, input as ['Cornell University', 'Ithaca, New York, USA'] output is Ithaca, NY, USA, input as ['Penn', 'Philadelphia, PA, USA'] output is Philadelphia, PA, USA, input as ['University of Maryland College Park', 'College Park, MD'] output is College Park, MD, USA, input as ['University of Michigan', 'Ann Arbor, MI, USA'] output is Ann Arbor, MI, USA, input as ['Columbia University', 'New York, NY, USA'] output is New York, NY, USA, input as ['NYU', 'New York, New York, USA'] output is New York, NY, USA, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
