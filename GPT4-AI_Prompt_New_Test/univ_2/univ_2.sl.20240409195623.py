Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Summary of Input Column Data:

The input data consists of two columns, each representing different aspects of universities in the United States. The first column contains the names of various prestigious universities, including but not limited to the University of Pennsylvania, UCLA, Cornell University, Penn (an informal name for the University of Pennsylvania), the University of Maryland College Park, and the University of Michigan. These names represent a mix of private and public institutions, known for their academic excellence and significant contributions to research and education.

The second column provides specific geographical information about the location of each university, including the city and state. Some entries also include the country, "USA," explicitly, while others leave it implied. This geographical information ranges from large, well-known cities like Los Angeles, California, and Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, to smaller college towns such as Ithaca, New York, and Ann Arbor, Michigan. The variation in location details reflects a common practice in addressing universities, where the level of geographical detail can vary based on the assumed familiarity of the audience with the location.

### Summary of Output Column Data:

The output data combines the information from the two input columns into a single, cohesive format: "University Name, City, State, Country." This format standardizes the presentation of each university's name alongside its geographical location, ensuring clarity and completeness. For entries where the country was not explicitly mentioned in the input, "USA" is added to the output, providing consistency across all entries and acknowledging the universities' location within the United States. The output demonstrates a uniform approach to presenting university names and locations, making it easier to understand and compare the information at a glance.

### Relationship Between Input and Output:

The transformation from input to output data illustrates a process of standardization and clarification. By combining the university name and its location into a single, consistent format, the output makes it easier for readers to grasp the essential information about each institution without needing to cross-reference between columns. This process also addresses any ambiguities or omissions in the input data, such as the implicit assumption that all universities are located in the USA, by explicitly adding "USA" where necessary. The relationship between the input and output underscores the importance of clear, standardized information presentation, especially when dealing with institutions that might be familiar to a wide audience with varying levels of knowledge about American geography and educational institutions., and input as ['University of Pennsylvania', 'Phialdelphia, PA, USA'] output is University of Pennsylvania, Phialdelphia, PA, USA, input as ['UCLA', 'Los Angeles, CA'] output is UCLA, Los Angeles, CA, USA, input as ['Cornell University', 'Ithaca, New York, USA'] output is Cornell University, Ithaca, New York, USA, input as ['Penn', 'Philadelphia, PA, USA'] output is Penn, Philadelphia, PA, USA, input as ['University of Maryland College Park', 'College Park, MD'] output is University of Maryland College Park, College Park, MD, USA, input as ['University of Michigan', 'Ann Arbor, MI, USA'] output is University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.

def generated_function(university_name, location):
    """
    This function takes the name of a university and its geographical location as inputs,
    and returns a standardized string combining both pieces of information.
    
    Parameters:
    university_name (str): The name of the university.
    location (str): The geographical location of the university, including city and state.
                    The country is optional and will be added as "USA" if not present.
    
    Returns:
