Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Summary for Input Column Data:

The input data consists of textual commands or requests that involve actions related to communication, specifically through email or contacting support. These commands are directed towards specific entities, identified by unique identifiers resembling email addresses or domain names. The structure of these commands typically follows a pattern where an action (e.g., "send email to" or "contact") is followed by a target (e.g., "json_acme.com" or "help_robot.com"). The target is usually a fabricated email address or domain name, intended for illustrative purposes rather than representing real entities. The input data is qualitative, focusing on the nature of the requests and the specific entities involved in these communications.

### Summary for Output Column Data:

The output data extracts and isolates the unique identifiers (e.g., "json_acme.com", "help_robot.com") from the input commands. These identifiers represent the primary focus or target of the actions described in the input data. The output is qualitative, emphasizing the identification and extraction of key information (the entities to be contacted or communicated with) from the broader context provided in the input. The output simplifies the input by distilling it down to the essential component, the entity's identifier, which is crucial for the intended action (sending an email or contacting support).

### Summary Describing the Relationship Between Input and Output:

The relationship between the input and output data is characterized by a process of extraction and simplification. The input data presents scenarios or commands involving communication actions directed towards specific entities. These entities are embedded within the context of a larger command structure. The output data, on the other hand, focuses solely on identifying and extracting these entities' identifiers from the input. This process highlights the core objective of the input commands - the target of the communication - by removing the surrounding textual context. The relationship underscores a transformation from a detailed action-oriented command to a simplified, focused identification of the key entity involved in that action. This distillation process facilitates the understanding of the primary goal or target within each command, making it easier to act upon or analyze further., and input as ['send email to json_acme.com'] output is json_acme.com, input as ['contact help_robot.com for all support requests'] output is help_robot.com, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
