Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Summary for Input Column Data:

The input data consists of URLs from different domains, specifically focusing on technology companies such as Apple and Microsoft. These URLs are structured to include the protocol (either HTTP or HTTPS), the domain name (such as www.apple.com or www.microsoft.com), and additional path components that may indicate a specific section or product of the website (like /uk/mac or /en-gb/windows). The URLs are varied in their structure, with some pointing to a specific product page and others to the main homepage of the company. The geographical region indicators within the URLs (/uk/ for the United Kingdom and /en-gb/ for English Great Britain) suggest that the websites are tailored to different locales, potentially offering region-specific content or products.

### Summary for Output Column Data:

The output data extracts specific keywords from the input URLs, which appear to represent either a product or the company itself. These keywords are 'mac', 'windows', and 'microsoft', each corresponding to a distinct product or the company name. The output simplifies the complex URLs into concise identifiers that highlight the primary focus or subject matter of the web page. This transformation from a detailed URL to a single keyword effectively distills the essence of the web page's content or its central offering.

### Relationship Summary:

The relationship between the input and output data is a process of extraction and simplification, where a detailed URL is condensed into a keyword that captures the main subject or product featured on the web page. This process involves identifying and isolating the most relevant part of the URL - typically the last segment of the path - which directly corresponds to a specific product (like 'mac' or 'windows') or the company name ('microsoft') when the URL points to the homepage. The output serves as a succinct representation of the input, making it easier to understand the primary focus of the URL at a glance. This summarization technique could be particularly useful for categorizing or indexing web pages based on their content or for creating a simplified overview of web resources related to specific products or companies., and input as ['http=//www.apple.com/uk/mac'] output is mac, input as ['https=//www.microsoft.com/en-gb/windows'] output is windows, input as ['https=//www.microsoft.com/'] output is microsoft, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
