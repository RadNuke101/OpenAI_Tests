Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Input Column Summary:

The input data consists of URLs from different technology companies, specifically their official websites. These URLs are structured to include the protocol (either HTTP or HTTPS), followed by the domain name, and often include additional path segments that lead to specific sections or products of the website. The domains observed in the examples include 'apple.com' and 'microsoft.com', indicating a focus on major technology corporations. The path segments vary, pointing to regional versions of the site (e.g., '/uk/' for the United Kingdom, '/en-gb/' for English Great Britain) and specific product categories or pages (e.g., '/mac', '/windows'). The structure of these URLs suggests that they are intended to direct users to specific information about products or services offered by these companies.

### Output Column Summary:

The output data extracts specific keywords from the input URLs, which appear to represent the main subject or product focus of the URL. These keywords include 'mac', 'windows', and 'microsoft'. The output simplifies the input URL to a single word or term that encapsulates the primary content or product featured in the link. This suggests a process of distillation, where the most relevant or significant part of the URL (in terms of content focus) is identified and extracted as a standalone piece of information.

### Relationship Summary:

The relationship between the input and output data is characterized by a process of extraction and simplification, where complex URLs are distilled down to key terms that represent the main content or product focus of the link. This process involves parsing the URL to identify and isolate the most informative or relevant segment, which is then output as a single keyword or term. The output effectively summarizes the primary focus of the input URL in a concise manner, making it easier to understand at a glance what product or service is being highlighted. This could be particularly useful for categorization, indexing, or summarization purposes, where understanding the essence of a URL's content quickly is valuable. The relationship underscores a methodical approach to data simplification, where detailed and structured input is transformed into succinct and informative output., and input as ['http=//www.apple.com/uk/mac'] output is mac, input as ['https=//www.microsoft.com/en-gb/windows'] output is windows, input as ['https=//www.microsoft.com/'] output is microsoft, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
