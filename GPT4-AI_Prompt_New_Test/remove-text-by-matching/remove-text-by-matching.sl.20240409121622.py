Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Input Column Summary:

The input column consists of strings representing phone numbers in a standard North American format. Each entry is a sequence of digits grouped into three parts: the area code, the central office code, and the line number, separated by hyphens. The format follows the pattern `XXX-XXX-XXXX`, where `X` represents a digit from 0 to 9. This format is widely recognized and used for readability and standardization in various contexts, including business, personal, and official communications. The input data is qualitative, as it represents a categorization or labeling of information rather than numerical values for computation.

### Output Column Summary:

The output column consists of strings representing phone numbers that have been transformed from the input format by removing the hyphens. The transformation results in a continuous sequence of digits, `XXXXXXXXXX`, without any separators. This format retains the complete information of the original phone number but in a compact form, which might be useful for systems that require numerical input without special characters or for simplifying data processing tasks. The output data, like the input, is treated as qualitative despite its numerical appearance, as it serves the purpose of identification rather than quantification.

### Relationship Summary:

The transformation from the input to the output column represents a process of simplification and standardization of phone number formats. The relationship between the input and output is a direct mapping where each character in the input, except for the hyphens, is preserved in the output in the same sequence. This process can be seen as a form of data cleaning or preparation, where unnecessary characters (in this case, hyphens) are removed to meet the requirements of a specific data processing task or to ensure compatibility with systems that may not accept non-numeric characters in certain fields.

The transformation does not alter the intrinsic value or meaning of the data; it merely changes its representation. This is a common practice in data processing and management, where data may be reformatted, encoded, or transformed to fit the needs of different applications or to ensure consistency across datasets. The relationship between the input and output highlights the importance of data formatting in the context of information management and the need for flexible methods to adapt data to various requirements without losing its essential characteristics., and input as ['801-345-1987'] output is 8013451987, input as ['612-554-2000'] output is 6125542000, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
