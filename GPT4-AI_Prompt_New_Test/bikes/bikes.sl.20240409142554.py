Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Input Column Summary:

The input data consists of strings that are a combination of a brand name followed by a numerical value, with no spaces in between. The brand names observed in the dataset are "Ducati" and "Honda." The numerical values following the brand names vary and include 100, 125, 250, and 550. These inputs represent a specific model or category, indicated by the combination of the brand name and the numerical value. The dataset does not provide explicit information about what the numerical values stand for, but they could imply model numbers, engine capacities, or other specifications related to the motorcycles.

### Output Column Summary:

The output data extracted from the input strings is purely qualitative, consisting of the brand names "Ducati" and "Honda" without any numerical values. This output represents a simplification or categorization of the input data, focusing solely on the brand aspect of each input string.

### Relationship Summary:

The relationship between the input and output data is a process of extraction and simplification, where the complex input strings, which include both brand names and numerical values, are distilled down to just the brand names in the output. This transformation indicates a filtering process where the qualitative aspect (brand name) is isolated from the quantitative or specific detail (numerical value) included in the input. The process suggests that the primary interest or focus for the output is the brand identity of the motorcycles, rather than their specific models or specifications denoted by the numerical values. This could be useful in contexts where the brand is more relevant than the specific model details, such as in brand-focused studies, market analysis, or when categorizing data for brand-centric insights., and input as ['Ducati100'] output is Ducati, input as ['Honda125'] output is Honda, input as ['Ducati250'] output is Ducati, input as ['Honda250'] output is Honda, input as ['Honda550'] output is Honda, input as ['Ducati125'] output is Ducati, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
