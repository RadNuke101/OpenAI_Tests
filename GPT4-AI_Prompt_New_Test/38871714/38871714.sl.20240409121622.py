'''
Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Summary of Input Column Data:

The input data consists of strings that include placeholder text within angle brackets `< >`. These placeholders are intended to be replaced or removed to transform the input text into a more coherent or specific output. The placeholders can represent various elements, such as nouns, verbs, or numerical values, depending on the context of the sentence. The input strings may describe actions, conditions, or statements that are made more precise or relevant by altering the placeholders.

### Summary of Output Column Data:

The output data are the transformed versions of the input strings, where the placeholders within angle brackets have been either replaced with specific words or removed, leading to sentences that are complete and contextually meaningful. The transformation process involves interpreting the placeholders' intended meaning and substituting them with appropriate terms or eliminating them to refine the sentences. The output retains the original sentence structure of the input while achieving a clearer, more specific, or actionable statement.

### Relationship Between Input and Output:

The relationship between the input and output data is characterized by a process of refinement and clarification. The input serves as a template with placeholders that lack specificity or clarity. The transformation process involves interpreting these placeholders within their contextual framework and replacing or removing them to produce a coherent and specific output. This process enhances the meaningfulness of the original sentences, making them more applicable or understandable in a given context. The transformation from input to output demonstrates a methodical approach to text refinement, where generic placeholders are replaced with concrete information or removed to streamline the message. This relationship underscores the importance of context and specificity in communication, highlighting how placeholders can be effectively used as a tool for drafting and later refining messages to achieve clarity and precision., and input as ['This is a <string>, It should be <changed> to <a> number.'] output is This is a string, It should be changed to a number., input as ['a < 4 and a > 0'] output is a  4 and a  0, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
