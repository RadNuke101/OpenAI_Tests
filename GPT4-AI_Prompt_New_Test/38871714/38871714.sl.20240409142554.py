Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Input Column Summary:

The input data consists of strings that include specific segments enclosed within angle brackets (`<` and `>`). These segments represent placeholders or variables within the text that are meant to be replaced or highlighted for some form of processing. The nature of the text surrounding these placeholders varies, indicating that the data could come from diverse contexts or applications. The placeholders themselves seem to be either descriptive, indicating the nature of the replacement needed, or symbolic, representing a condition or a value to be considered. The use of angle brackets suggests a structured approach to identifying these key segments within the texts, possibly for automated processing or transformation.

### Output Column Summary:

The output data retains the structure and content of the input data with the notable exception of the removal of the angle brackets. This transformation suggests that the process involves either the literal removal of these brackets without altering the text enclosed within them or the replacement of the placeholder text with appropriate values that no longer necessitate the brackets. However, based on the provided examples, the transformation predominantly involves the removal of the brackets, leaving the placeholder text unchanged. This results in outputs that are essentially the same as the inputs but without the specific markers (angle brackets) around certain segments.

### Relationship Between Input and Output:

The primary relationship between the input and output data is the process of removing or processing the angle-bracket-enclosed segments within the input texts. This process transforms the input by either simply removing the brackets to integrate the placeholder text seamlessly into the output or by indicating that a further step of replacement or interpretation of these placeholders was intended but not shown in the examples. The transformation suggests a simplification or clarification step in data processing, where the marked segments are either considered resolved or are presented in a form that no longer requires special notation. This could be part of a data cleaning or preparation step in a larger workflow, where inputs are standardized or simplified for further processing, analysis, or display. The consistent removal of the brackets across examples indicates a systematic approach to handling these marked segments, pointing towards an automated or rule-based processing system designed to work with such structured textual data., and input as ['This is a <string>, It should be <changed> to <a> number.'] output is This is a string, It should be changed to a number., input as ['a < 4 and a > 0'] output is a  4 and a  0, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
