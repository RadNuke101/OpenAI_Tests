Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Summary of Input Column Data:

The input data consists of strings that include placeholders marked by angle brackets (`<` and `>`). These placeholders are used to indicate segments within the strings that are intended to be replaced or highlighted for some form of transformation. The content within the angle brackets varies, including words and symbols, suggesting that the placeholders are used for a wide range of purposes, from indicating specific words to be changed to denoting conditions or values in logical expressions. The use of angle brackets to denote these placeholders is consistent across the examples, indicating a structured approach to highlighting these segments for transformation or attention.

### Summary of Output Column Data:

The output data represents the transformation of the input strings where the content within the angle brackets has been exposed or revealed by removing the angle brackets themselves. This process effectively integrates the previously placeholder-marked segments into the rest of the string seamlessly. The transformation does not add or alter the content that was within the angle brackets; it simply removes the brackets, making the content a direct part of the sentence or expression. This results in a more fluid and coherent string where the previously marked segments are now fully integrated parts of the overall text.

### Relationship Between Input and Output:

The relationship between the input and output data is characterized by a transformation process focused on the removal of angle brackets that serve as placeholders within the input strings. This process does not alter the content within the brackets but integrates it into the surrounding text by removing the markers that set it apart. The transformation is consistent across examples, indicating a rule-based approach where the presence of angle brackets signifies content that is to be seamlessly incorporated into the output string. This relationship highlights a method of using structural markers to indicate segments within text data that are subject to change or require attention, with the transformation process focused on the integration of these segments into the larger context of the string., and input as ['This is a <string>, It should be <changed> to <a> number.'] output is This is a string, It should be changed to a number., input as ['a < 4 and a > 0'] output is a  4 and a  0, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
