Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Input Column 1 Summary:
The first input column contains strings that represent filenames with a specific format. Each filename starts with a six-digit date (in the format DDMMYY), followed by an underscore, and then a descriptive word or phrase that indicates the content or purpose of the file (e.g., "assignment", "cost"), and finally, the file extension ".xlsx" which denotes an Excel spreadsheet. This pattern suggests that the data likely pertains to documents related to specific dates, possibly for assignments, financial records, or other date-specific activities or reports.

### Input Column 2 Summary:
The second input column contains single-digit numerical strings, either '1' or '2'. These numbers appear to act as selectors or indicators for a specific part of the filename mentioned in the first input column. The digit '1' indicates the selection of the date part of the filename, while the digit '2' indicates the selection of the remainder of the filename (i.e., the descriptive part along with the ".xlsx" extension).

### Output Column Summary:
The output column contains strings that are either the date portion or the descriptive portion (including the file extension) of the filenames provided in the first input column. The specific output depends on the value provided in the second input column. If the second input column contains '1', the output is the date portion of the filename. If it contains '2', the output is the descriptive portion of the filename, including the ".xlsx" extension. This suggests a direct relationship between the second input column and the part of the filename that is outputted.

### Relationship Summary:
The relationship between the input columns and the output column is a function of selection based on the value provided in the second input column. The first input column provides a source string (a filename), and the second input column specifies which part of this source string should be extracted and presented in the output column. Specifically:
- When the second input column contains '1', the output is derived by extracting the date portion (the first six digits) of the filename from the first input column.
- When the second input column contains '2', the output consists of the descriptive portion of the filename, including the file extension, which follows the underscore character in the filename from the first input column.

This relationship demonstrates a conditional extraction process based on the selector value provided in the second input column, allowing for the dynamic segmentation of the filename into its constituent parts., and input as ['011016_assignment.xlsx', '1'] output is 011016, input as ['011016_assignment.xlsx', '2'] output is assignment.xlsx, input as ['030116_cost.xlsx', '1'] output is 030116, input as ['030116_cost.xlsx', '2'] output is cost.xlsx, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
