Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Summary for Input Column Data:

The input data consists of a collection of internet domain names. These domain names are qualitative in nature and represent addresses of websites on the internet. Each entry in the input column is a string that typically includes a combination of subdomains (like 'www'), the domain name itself (such as 'domain', 'mail', 'amazon'), and the top-level domain (TLD) or country code top-level domain (ccTLD) such as 'com', 'net', 'co.uk'. The structure of these domain names follows a common pattern where the components are separated by dots ('.'). The variety in the input data reflects the diverse nature of internet domain names, encompassing different types of TLDs and ccTLDs, and potentially different levels of domain hierarchy (e.g., 'co.uk' indicating a domain registered in the United Kingdom).

### Summary for Output Column Data:

The output data extracted from the input domain names is specifically focused on the top-level domain (TLD) or the country code top-level domain (ccTLD) part of each domain name. The output is qualitative and consists of the last segment of the domain names provided in the input, which represents the highest level in the domain name hierarchy that indicates either the type of organization (.com, .net) or the geographic location (.uk for the United Kingdom) associated with the domain. The output data is simpler and more uniform than the input, as it distills the domain names down to their essential, categorizing components.

### Relationship Summary:

The relationship between the input and output data is a process of extraction and simplification, where the complex and varied domain names in the input are distilled to their most categorizing and defining components—the TLDs or ccTLDs—in the output. This process highlights the hierarchical nature of domain names, where the last segment (TLD or ccTLD) plays a crucial role in classifying the domain by its type or geographic association. The transformation from input to output effectively reduces the qualitative data from a detailed address to a simple, categorical identifier that provides insight into the nature or origin of the domain. This relationship underscores the importance of TLDs and ccTLDs in the structure of domain names and their utility in classifying and understanding the vast landscape of the internet., and input as ['www.domain.com'] output is com, input as ['mail.net'] output is net, input as ['www.amaon.co.uk'] output is uk, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
