Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Summary of Input Column Data

The input data consists of a series of internet domain names. These domain names are structured in a hierarchical manner, typically including a combination of subdomains, a second-level domain (SLD), and a top-level domain (TLD). The examples provided, such as 'www.domain.com', 'mail.net', and 'www.amaon.co.uk', showcase a variety of domain structures. These structures can include a subdomain prefix (e.g., 'www' or 'mail'), the actual name of the domain (e.g., 'domain', 'net', 'amaon'), and the top-level domain or country code top-level domain (e.g., '.com', '.net', '.co.uk'). The input data represents a qualitative dataset, focusing on the textual and structural aspects of internet domain names rather than any quantitative measures.

### Summary of Output Column Data

The output data extracts and presents the top-level domain (TLD) or the country code top-level domain (ccTLD) from each input domain name. For example, from 'www.domain.com', the output is 'com'; from 'mail.net', the output is 'net'; and from 'www.amaon.co.uk', the output is 'uk'. This output data highlights the highest-level domain classification in the domain name hierarchy, which can indicate the type of organization (.com for commercial, .net for network infrastructures) or the country of registration (.uk for the United Kingdom). The output is qualitative, focusing on the categorization and identification of domain types based on their top-level domain identifiers.

### Relationship Between Input and Output Data

The relationship between the input and output data is a process of extraction and classification. The output is derived by identifying and isolating the top-level domain (TLD) or country code top-level domain (ccTLD) from the full domain name provided in the input. This process involves analyzing the structure of each domain name, recognizing the hierarchical components, and extracting the final segment that represents the domain's highest-level classification. The relationship underscores the significance of the TLD or ccTLD in categorizing and understanding the nature or origin of the domain. It reflects a methodical approach to parsing and classifying domain names based on their structural components, specifically focusing on the part of the domain that indicates its top-level affiliation or geographic association., and input as ['www.domain.com'] output is com, input as ['mail.net'] output is net, input as ['www.amaon.co.uk'] output is uk, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.

# Test cases
# Note: The function is designed to process a single domain name string per call.
# To test with the examples provided, call the function separately for each example.

# Example 1
domain_1 = 'www.domain.com'
# Call the function with domain_1 and handle the output as needed

# Example 2
domain_2 = 'mail.net'
# Call the function with domain_2 and handle the output as needed

# Example 3
domain_3 = 'www.amaon.co.uk'
# Call the function with domain_3 and handle the output as needed
