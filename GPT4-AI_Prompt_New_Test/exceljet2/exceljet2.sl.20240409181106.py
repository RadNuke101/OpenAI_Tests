Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Summary for Input Column Data:

The input data consists of a series of internet domain names. These domain names are strings that represent addresses where different entities host their websites. The format of these domain names varies, including simple second-level domains (SLDs) like 'domain.com' or 'mail.net', as well as more complex ones that include a third-level domain (subdomain) such as 'www.domain.com' or 'www.amazon.co.uk'. The variations in the domain names indicate different organizational or geographical categorizations. For instance, the presence of 'co' in 'www.amazon.co.uk' suggests a commercial entity in the United Kingdom. The input data, being qualitative, showcases the diversity in internet domain naming conventions, reflecting both the type of entity and its geographical or organizational affiliation.

### Summary for Output Column Data:

The output data extracted from the input domain names is a series of top-level domain (TLD) extensions. These TLDs include 'com', 'net', and 'uk', representing the highest level of domain names in the hierarchical Domain Name System of the Internet. The TLDs serve as key indicators of either the nature of the entity ('com' for commercial, 'net' for network) or the geographical location ('uk' for the United Kingdom). The output data, therefore, simplifies the diverse and complex information present in the input domain names into a concise categorization that highlights either the primary purpose or the geographical affiliation of the entity associated with the domain name.

### Relationship Summary between Input and Output:

The relationship between the input and output data is a process of extraction and simplification, where the complex and varied domain names (input) are distilled down to their top-level domains (TLDs) (output). This process reveals the fundamental categorization of the domain names, focusing on either their primary purpose (commercial, network, etc.) or their geographical affiliation (country codes). The extraction of TLDs from the full domain names serves as a method to classify and understand the broader context of the internet entities represented by these domain names. It simplifies the qualitative data from a diverse set of domain naming conventions to a concise set of categories that are easier to analyze and understand in terms of their global distribution and purpose on the internet., and input as ['www.domain.com'] output is com, input as ['mail.net'] output is net, input as ['www.amaon.co.uk'] output is uk, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
