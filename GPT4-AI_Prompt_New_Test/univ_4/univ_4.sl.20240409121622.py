Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Summary of Input Column Data:

The input data consists of two columns, each representing different aspects of universities located in the United States. The first column lists the names of the universities, which include a mix of full university names (e.g., "University of Pennsylvania") and abbreviations or informal names (e.g., "UCLA" for University of California, Los Angeles). This variety indicates a broad representation of institutions, from Ivy League universities like Columbia University to large public research universities like the University of Michigan.

The second column provides the location of these universities, including the city and state. In some instances, the country ("USA") is also included, while in others, it is omitted. This column shows a geographical diversity across the United States, covering both coasts, the Midwest, and the Northeast. The cities and states mentioned are known for hosting major academic institutions, reflecting the widespread nature of higher education in the country.

### Summary of Output Column Data:

The output data standardizes the format of the university locations provided in the second input column. It ensures consistency by always including the city, the state abbreviation, and the country ("USA"), even when the original input did not specify the country. This standardization process simplifies the geographical information, making it more uniform and easier to understand at a glance. The output corrects minor errors (e.g., "Phialdelphia" to "Philadelphia") and standardizes state names to their abbreviations (e.g., "New York" to "NY").

### Relationship Between Input and Output:

The relationship between the input and output columns demonstrates a process of standardization and correction of university location data. The output takes the diverse formats and levels of detail provided in the input and converts them into a consistent, easy-to-read format that includes the essential geographical identifiers: city, state abbreviation, and country. This process not only makes the data more uniform but also ensures accuracy and clarity, correcting any spelling mistakes and standardizing state names to their abbreviations. The transformation highlights the importance of consistency in data presentation, especially when dealing with qualitative information like university names and locations., and input as ['University of Pennsylvania', 'Phialdelphia, PA, USA'] output is Phialdelphia, PA, USA, input as ['UCLA', 'Los Angeles, CA'] output is Los Angeles, CA, USA, input as ['Cornell University', 'Ithaca, New York, USA'] output is Ithaca, NY, USA, input as ['Penn', 'Philadelphia, PA, USA'] output is Philadelphia, PA, USA, input as ['University of Maryland College Park', 'College Park, MD'] output is College Park, MD, USA, input as ['University of Michigan', 'Ann Arbor, MI, USA'] output is Ann Arbor, MI, USA, input as ['Columbia University', 'New York, NY, USA'] output is New York, NY, USA, input as ['NYU', 'New York, New York, USA'] output is New York, NY, USA, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
