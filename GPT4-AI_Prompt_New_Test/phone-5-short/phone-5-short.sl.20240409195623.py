Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Summary of Input Data

The input data consists of strings formatted as phone numbers with an international dialing format. Each string begins with a plus sign (+) followed by a country code, a space, and then a sequence of digits separated by hyphens. The country codes vary in length, ranging from one to three digits. The rest of the number is divided into three segments by hyphens, with the length of these segments also varying. The input data represents a qualitative attribute, specifically the format and structure of international phone numbers, including their country codes.

### Summary of Output Data

The output data extracts the country code from each input string, represented as a numerical value. These values range from single digits to three digits, directly correlating to the initial segment of the input string following the plus sign. The output is a quantitative representation of the qualitative input data, focusing solely on the country code aspect of the phone numbers.

### Relationship Between Input and Output

The relationship between the input and output data is a direct extraction process where the output isolates and represents the country code portion of the input phone numbers. The output disregards the rest of the phone number, focusing on the initial segment that identifies the country code. This process transforms a piece of qualitative data (the full phone number in a specific format) into a quantitative summary (the numerical country code). The transformation is consistent across all data points, indicating a systematic approach to extracting the country code from a structured string format. This relationship highlights the ability to distill specific quantitative information from a broader set of qualitative data., and input as ['+106 769-858-438'] output is 106, input as ['+83 973-757-831'] output is 83, input as ['+62 647-787-775'] output is 62, input as ['+172 027-507-632'] output is 172, input as ['+72 001-050-856'] output is 72, input as ['+95 310-537-401'] output is 95, input as ['+6 775-969-238'] output is 6, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
