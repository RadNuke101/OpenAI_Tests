Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Summary for Input Column Data:

The input data consists of two distinct columns that together provide detailed information about various universities and their geographical locations. The first column lists the names of prestigious universities, indicating a focus on higher education institutions that are likely recognized for their academic excellence and contributions to research and scholarship. These universities include the University of Pennsylvania, Cornell University, University of Maryland College Park, University of Michigan, Yale University, and Columbia University, showcasing a variety of institutions across different states in the USA.

The second column specifies the exact geographical locations of these universities, including the city, state, and in most cases, the country (USA). This column provides a clear indication of where each university is situated, highlighting a geographical spread across the United States, from the East Coast (e.g., New York, Pennsylvania, Connecticut) to the Midwest (e.g., Michigan). The inclusion of both city and state ensures a precise understanding of each university's location, which is crucial for identifying regional educational hubs and understanding the distribution of academic institutions across the country.

### Summary for Output Column Data:

The output data combines the information provided in the two input columns into a single, cohesive format. Each entry in the output column presents the name of a university followed by its geographical location, seamlessly integrating the institution's identity with its physical setting. This format enhances the readability and utility of the information, making it straightforward for users to associate each university with its location. The output data maintains a consistent structure, ensuring that the name of the university is always followed by the city, state, and when provided, the country (USA), thereby offering a comprehensive overview of each institution's geographical context.

### Relationship between Input and Output:

The relationship between the input and output data is characterized by a transformation process that merges two separate pieces of information (university name and location) into a single, unified statement. This process enhances the clarity and accessibility of the information, making it more user-friendly and applicable for various purposes, such as academic research, location-based analysis, or general knowledge about higher education institutions in the USA. The output effectively encapsulates the essence of the input data, providing a succinct yet detailed representation of each university's identity and geographical presence. This transformation underscores the importance of clear and efficient communication of information, particularly when dealing with qualitative data that involves names and locations of significant educational institutions., and input as ['University of Pennsylvania', 'Phialdelphia, PA, USA'] output is University of Pennsylvania, Phialdelphia, PA, USA, input as ['Cornell University', 'Ithaca, New York, USA'] output is Cornell University, Ithaca, New York, USA, input as ['University of Maryland College Park', 'College Park, MD'] output is University of Maryland College Park, College Park, MD, input as ['University of Michigan', 'Ann Arbor, MI, USA'] output is University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA, input as ['Yale University', 'New Haven, CT, USA'] output is Yale University, New Haven, CT, USA, input as ['Columbia University', 'New York, NY, USA'] output is Columbia University, New York, NY, USA, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
