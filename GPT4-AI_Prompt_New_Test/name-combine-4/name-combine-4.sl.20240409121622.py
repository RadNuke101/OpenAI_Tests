Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Input Column 1 Summary (First Names):
The first input column consists of a list of first names, which are diverse in their origin and phonetic composition. These names include Launa, Lakenya, Brendan, Bradford, and Rudolf. The variety in the names suggests a multicultural aspect, with each name potentially representing different ethnic or cultural backgrounds. The names vary in length and complexity, from short and simple names like Launa to longer and more complex ones like Lakenya. This diversity in first names does not follow a specific pattern, indicating that the dataset might be randomly selected or intended to represent a broad spectrum of individuals.

### Input Column 2 Summary (Last Names):
The second input column contains last names: Withers, Edison, Hage, Lango, and Akiyama. Similar to the first names, these last names are diverse, suggesting a multicultural dataset. The last names range from those of Anglo-Saxon origin (e.g., Withers) to those of Japanese origin (e.g., Akiyama), covering a wide geographical and cultural spectrum. This diversity in last names, like the first names, points to a dataset that does not discriminate based on geographic or ethnic origins, possibly aiming for inclusivity or a broad representation of populations.

### Output Column Summary:
The output column presents a transformation of the input data into a standardized format, specifically "Last Name, First Initial." This format includes the last name in full, followed by a comma, a space, and then the first initial of the given name, ending with a period. This transformation suggests a formal or professional context where such a naming convention might be preferred, such as in academic citations, professional directories, or formal communication. The output uniformly applies this format across the diverse set of names, indicating a process that standardizes personal names for consistency and possibly anonymity or privacy.

### Relationship Between Input and Output:
The relationship between the input columns and the output column is a process of standardization and abbreviation. The input data, consisting of full first and last names, is transformed into a more formal and concise format in the output. This process involves retaining the full last name while abbreviating the first name to its initial, followed by a period. This transformation could serve multiple purposes, such as creating a uniform format for names in a database, preparing names for publication in a formal document, or ensuring a level of privacy by not disclosing full first names. The procedure highlights a common practice in data handling where personal names are reformatted to meet specific criteria or standards, reflecting the need for consistency, professionalism, or privacy in various contexts., and input as ['Launa', 'Withers'] output is Withers, L., input as ['Lakenya', 'Edison'] output is Edison, L., input as ['Brendan', 'Hage'] output is Hage, B., input as ['Bradford', 'Lango'] output is Lango, B., input as ['Rudolf', 'Akiyama'] output is Akiyama, R., , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
