Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Summary of Input Column Data:

The input data consists of strings that represent a sequence of words separated by the delimiter "/n". Each word in the sequence is a cardinal number written in English, starting from "one" and potentially increasing sequentially. The structure of the input data suggests a pattern where each additional segment (separated by "/n") represents an incremental increase in the sequence of numbers. The input data is qualitative, representing a textual form of numerical concepts.

### Summary of Output Column Data:

The output data is numerical, representing the count of segments (or words representing numbers) present in each input string. The output is a direct quantitative reflection of the qualitative data presented in the input, translating the sequence of textual numbers into a simple numeric count. This count is always an integer, starting from 1 and increasing with the complexity of the input string.

### Relationship Between Input and Output:

The relationship between the input and output data is a transformation from a qualitative representation of numbers to a quantitative count of those representations. Specifically, the output is a function of the input, where the function counts the number of segments (or cardinal numbers) represented in the input string. This transformation is consistent and predictable, with each additional "/n" separated segment in the input increasing the output count by 1. The process highlights a method of converting a textual sequence of numbers into a simple numeric summary, demonstrating a clear, linear relationship between the complexity of the input data and the numeric value of the output., and input as ['one'] output is 1, input as ['one/ntwo'] output is 2, input as ['one/ntwo/nthree'] output is 3, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
