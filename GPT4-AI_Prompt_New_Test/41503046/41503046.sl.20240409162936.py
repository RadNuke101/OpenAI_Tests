Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Input Column Summary:

The input column consists of a list of scientific names for various plant species. These names are structured in a hierarchical manner, reflecting the taxonomic classification of each plant. The names are presented in a format that typically includes the genus and species, and in some cases, also includes the subspecies. The inclusion of subspecies is indicated by the use of "ssp." followed by the subspecies name. This format is consistent with standard botanical nomenclature, which provides a systematic way to classify and name plants based on their evolutionary relationships. The variety in the input data reflects a range of different genera and species, showcasing the diversity within the plant kingdom. The input data includes both aquatic and terrestrial plants, indicating a broad spectrum of ecological adaptations.

### Output Column Summary:

The output column simplifies the scientific names provided in the input column by either retaining just the genus name or, in cases where the subspecies is specified, combining the genus and species names. This simplification process results in a more generalized identification of the plants, which could be useful for contexts where detailed taxonomic resolution (down to the subspecies level) is not necessary. The output retains enough information to identify the plant at a broader taxonomic level, making it accessible for general discussions or overviews where precise subspecies identification is not critical. This approach streamlines the information, making it easier to manage and understand for non-specialists or in situations where detailed specificity is not required.

### Relationship Summary:

The relationship between the input and output columns demonstrates a systematic approach to simplifying plant names from a detailed taxonomic classification to a more generalized identification. This process involves either truncating the name to the genus level or, in cases with subspecies, to the genus and species level. This simplification reflects an understanding of the hierarchical nature of biological classification, where the genus and species provide a universally recognized method for identifying plants. The approach taken in generating the output from the input data serves to bridge the gap between detailed scientific nomenclature and more accessible, general plant identification. It highlights the balance between specificity and generalization, catering to contexts where a detailed understanding of plant taxonomy is less critical than broader identification., and input as ['Polygonum amphibium'] output is Polygonum, input as ['Hippuris vulgaris'] output is Hippuris, input as ['Lysimachia vulgaris'] output is Lysimachia, input as ['Juncus bulbosus ssp. bulbosus'] output is Juncus bulbosus, input as ['Lycopus europaeus ssp. europaeus'] output is Lycopus europaeus, input as ['Nymphaea alba'] output is Nymphaea, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
