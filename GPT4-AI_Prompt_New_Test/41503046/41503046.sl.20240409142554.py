Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Summary of Input Column Data

The input data consists of scientific names of various plant species, each represented in a structured format that typically includes the genus, species, and sometimes subspecies or variety. These names are drawn from a diverse range of plant genera, indicating a wide variety of plant types being considered. The presence of both common and more specific taxa (e.g., subspecies) suggests a detailed level of botanical classification. The input data reflects a focus on botanical nomenclature and the hierarchical classification system used in the biological sciences to organize and categorize plants. This system allows for precise identification and communication about plant species across different regions and languages.

### Summary of Output Column Data

The output data simplifies the input scientific names into a more generalized form, primarily focusing on the genus and, in some cases, the species level, but omitting the subspecies or variety level when present. This simplification process results in a more accessible level of identification that still retains significant botanical specificity to be useful for a broad range of applications, from ecological studies to general plant identification. The output reflects a standardization process that balances between detailed scientific accuracy and practical usability in broader contexts.

### Relationship Summary

The transformation from the input to the output data represents a process of simplification and standardization of botanical names. This process involves extracting the most universally relevant parts of the plant's scientific name (i.e., the genus and sometimes the species) while omitting the more detailed classification levels like subspecies or variety. This method acknowledges the importance of the genus (and sometimes species) in broadly identifying and categorizing plants, which is often sufficient for many practical purposes, including ecological research, conservation efforts, and general education about plant biodiversity.

The relationship between the input and output data underscores the balance between detailed scientific classification and the need for accessible, generalized information. It highlights the importance of scientific nomenclature in providing a standardized language for discussing biodiversity while also recognizing the practical considerations of communicating about plants in a variety of settings. This approach facilitates broader understanding and appreciation of plant diversity without requiring specialized knowledge of the full taxonomic hierarchy., and input as ['Polygonum amphibium'] output is Polygonum, input as ['Hippuris vulgaris'] output is Hippuris, input as ['Lysimachia vulgaris'] output is Lysimachia, input as ['Juncus bulbosus ssp. bulbosus'] output is Juncus bulbosus, input as ['Lycopus europaeus ssp. europaeus'] output is Lycopus europaeus, input as ['Nymphaea alba'] output is Nymphaea, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
