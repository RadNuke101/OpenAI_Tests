Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Input Column Summary:

The input data consists of strings that describe various scenarios or items with associated numerical values. These strings are qualitative in nature and provide context around the numerical value they contain. The contexts vary widely, from mentioning quantities of items (e.g., "100 apples"), to stating prices (e.g., "the price is %500 dollars"), to specifying identifiers (e.g., "serial number %003399"). The format of the numerical values within the strings is not consistent; they can be presented with different prefixes (e.g., none, "%"), and the numerical values can be in different formats (e.g., whole numbers, numbers with leading zeros). The input data requires parsing to extract the relevant numerical information accurately while considering the surrounding text for proper interpretation.

### Output Column Summary:

The output data consists solely of the numerical values extracted from the input strings. These values are presented in the format in which they appear in the input, including any leading zeros. The output is quantitative, representing either quantities, prices, serial numbers, or other numerical information directly extracted from the input. The output data is a simplified, standardized representation of the numerical aspect of the input data, stripped of its qualitative context.

### Relationship Summary:

The relationship between the input and output columns is a process of extracting and isolating the numerical values from a qualitative, textual context. This process involves identifying and parsing the numbers within the input strings, regardless of the surrounding text or the format in which these numbers are presented. The transformation from input to output involves:

1. **Identification**: Recognizing the presence of a numerical value within a string of text.
2. **Extraction**: Isolating the numerical value from the surrounding text, including any specific formatting details such as leading zeros or symbols.
3. **Standardization**: Presenting the extracted numerical value in a consistent manner in the output, maintaining its original format but devoid of its qualitative context.

This relationship highlights the ability to distill quantitative information from qualitative descriptions, enabling a focus on the numerical aspects of the data while disregarding the varied textual contexts in which these numbers are embedded., and input as ['100 apples'] output is 100, input as ['the price is %500 dollars'] output is 500, input as ['serial number %003399'] output is 003399, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
