Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Input Column Summary

The input data consists of a series of strings formatted as phone numbers or similar numerical sequences. Each string is structured in a three-part format separated by hyphens, following the pattern `XXX-XXX-XXX` where `X` represents a digit. The data does not convey any explicit quantitative value or order; instead, it should be treated as qualitative, representing unique identifiers or codes. The sequences vary across each entry, with no immediately apparent pattern or sequence linking them together. The format is consistent across all entries, maintaining the three-part, hyphen-separated structure.

### Output Column Summary

The output data mirrors the input in terms of the sequence of numbers but alters the formatting by replacing hyphens (`-`) with periods (`.`). This transformation results in a format that resembles a decimal notation or an IP address, yet, like the input, it should be considered qualitative data. Each output retains the exact sequence of digits from its corresponding input, ensuring a direct one-to-one relationship between each input-output pair. The alteration in formatting is the only change, with no modifications to the order or value of the digits themselves.

### Relationship Summary

The relationship between the input and output columns is a straightforward transformation of format from a hyphen-separated sequence to a period-separated sequence. This process does not alter the intrinsic value or the order of the digits within each sequence, maintaining a direct correspondence between each input and its output. The transformation can be seen as a reformatting or restyling of the data, moving from one qualitative representation to another without affecting the underlying identifiers. This consistent pattern of transformation suggests a systematic approach to data formatting, possibly intended to meet specific presentation or processing requirements., and input as ['938-242-504'] output is 938.242.504, input as ['308-916-545'] output is 308.916.545, input as ['623-599-749'] output is 623.599.749, input as ['981-424-843'] output is 981.424.843, input as ['118-980-214'] output is 118.980.214, input as ['244-655-094'] output is 244.655.094, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
