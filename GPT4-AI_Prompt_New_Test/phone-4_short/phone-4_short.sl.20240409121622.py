Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Summary of Input Column Data:

The input data consists of a series of strings formatted as phone numbers or similar numerical sequences, each separated by hyphens. Each string is structured in a three-part format, with each part separated by a hyphen ("-"). The format follows the pattern: XXX-XXX-XXX, where "X" represents a digit from 0 to 9. The data appears to be homogeneous in structure, with each entry adhering to this specific format. There is no apparent numerical or sequential order to the numbers within the dataset, suggesting that the data might represent a random or unsorted collection of numerical identifiers, such as phone numbers, serial numbers, or similar identifiers.

### Summary of Output Column Data:

The output data mirrors the input data in terms of the numerical sequences provided but differs in the separators used between the numbers. Instead of hyphens, the output uses periods (".") to separate the numbers within each sequence. The format in the output is XXX.XXX.XXX, maintaining the three-part structure seen in the input but altering the visual and textual representation of the separators. This change suggests a transformation in the format for presentation or processing purposes, while the numerical content remains unchanged.

### Relationship Between Input and Output:

The transformation from the input to the output data involves a simple yet specific alteration in the formatting of the numerical sequences. The process converts the separator within each sequence from a hyphen ("-") to a period ("."), while the numerical parts of each sequence remain intact and unchanged. This transformation indicates a reformatting process that does not alter the intrinsic value or the order of the numbers but changes their presentation format. This could be relevant in contexts where different systems or standards require different formatting conventions for numerical identifiers. The relationship between the input and output data underscores a formatting conversion process, emphasizing the preservation of numerical content while adapting to different stylistic or structural requirements., and input as ['938-242-504'] output is 938.242.504, input as ['308-916-545'] output is 308.916.545, input as ['623-599-749'] output is 623.599.749, input as ['981-424-843'] output is 981.424.843, input as ['118-980-214'] output is 118.980.214, input as ['244-655-094'] output is 244.655.094, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
