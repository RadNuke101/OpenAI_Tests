Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Summary of Input Column Data

The input data consists of a series of strings formatted as phone numbers or similar numerical sequences, each separated by hyphens. Each string follows a consistent pattern of three groups of digits, with the groups being separated by hyphens ("-"). The pattern is "XXX-XXX-XXX", where "X" represents a digit from 0 to 9. The input data does not convey any explicit geographical, temporal, or categorical information based solely on the formatting or the content of the numbers themselves. The sequences appear to be arbitrary and do not follow a numerical order or progression. The input data is qualitative in nature, as the sequences are treated as identifiers or codes rather than quantities to be mathematically manipulated.

### Summary of Output Column Data

The output data closely mirrors the input data in content but differs in formatting. The primary transformation involves replacing the hyphens ("-") in the input data with periods ("."). Thus, the output format changes from "XXX-XXX-XXX" to "XXX.XXX.XXX". Like the input, the output data is qualitative, treating the sequences as identifiers or codes. The change in separators does not alter the inherent nature of the data but may reflect a different convention for presenting or interpreting the same sequences.

### Relationship Between Input and Output

The transformation from the input to the output column data is straightforward and consistent: it involves changing the separator between the groups of digits from a hyphen to a period. This process retains the original sequence of digits without any additions, deletions, or rearrangements. The relationship between the input and output data is a direct mapping, where each input string is converted to a corresponding output string through a simple, rule-based transformation. This transformation does not imply any change in the qualitative nature of the data; it merely represents a change in formatting convention. The reason for this transformation could be related to standardizing data presentation, adapting to different system requirements, or aligning with different cultural or organizational conventions for displaying numerical sequences., and input as ['938-242-504'] output is 938.242.504, input as ['308-916-545'] output is 308.916.545, input as ['623-599-749'] output is 623.599.749, input as ['981-424-843'] output is 981.424.843, input as ['118-980-214'] output is 118.980.214, input as ['244-655-094'] output is 244.655.094, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
