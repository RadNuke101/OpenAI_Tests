Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Summary of Input Column Data:

The input data consists of strings formatted as phone numbers or similar numerical sequences, separated by hyphens. Each string is structured in a three-part format, with each part separated by a hyphen ("-"). The format follows the pattern XXX-XXX-XXX, where "X" represents a digit from 0 to 9. The data appears to be uniformly structured, with no variations in the format across the different entries. Each entry is unique, indicating a diverse set of data points without repetitions. The input data is qualitative in nature, representing a specific coding or numbering system rather than quantitative values.

### Summary of Output Column Data:

The output data closely mirrors the input data in content but differs in the separators used between the numerical sequences. Instead of hyphens, the output uses periods (".") to separate the sequences, following the pattern XXX.XXX.XXX. This change in separator is the only modification from the input to the output, with the numerical sequences themselves remaining unchanged. The output retains the uniform structure and unique nature of each entry, similar to the input data. The transformation from input to output suggests a simple, consistent rule applied to all data points, focusing on the alteration of the separator character.

### Relationship Between Input and Output:

The relationship between the input and output data is straightforward and consistent across all entries. The transformation process involves replacing the hyphens in the input data with periods in the output data, without altering the numerical sequences themselves. This process suggests a direct mapping from input to output, where the content remains the same, but the format is slightly altered to meet a specific presentation or coding requirement. The data transformation does not involve any manipulation of the numerical values, indicating that the essence of the data remains intact, with only the visual representation being modified. This relationship highlights a simple formatting change, likely intended to standardize the data presentation or to adapt it for a specific context where periods are preferred over hyphens., and input as ['938-242-504'] output is 938.242.504, input as ['308-916-545'] output is 308.916.545, input as ['623-599-749'] output is 623.599.749, input as ['981-424-843'] output is 981.424.843, input as ['118-980-214'] output is 118.980.214, input as ['244-655-094'] output is 244.655.094, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
