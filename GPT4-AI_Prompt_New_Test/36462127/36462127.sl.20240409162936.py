Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Input Column Summary:

The input data consists of strings that are sequences of uppercase alphabetic characters divided into segments by forward slashes ('/'). Each string appears to represent a hierarchical or structured set of elements, possibly indicating a sequence or categorization where the segments might represent different levels or types of information. The number of segments within each string varies, indicating variability in the depth or complexity of the information represented. The characters within each segment are contiguous sequences from the English alphabet, suggesting that the segments could represent codes, identifiers, or a form of shorthand for larger sets of information. The variability in the length of segments suggests that there is no fixed format for the information within a given level of the hierarchy.

### Output Column Summary:

The output data consists of strings that are the last segment from each corresponding input string. These outputs are also sequences of uppercase alphabetic characters without any dividing characters, indicating a selection or extraction process from the input data. The output represents a specific level of information, specifically the most granular level or the last element in the hierarchical structure provided by the input. This suggests a focus on the final or most detailed part of the information provided in the input.

### Relationship Summary:

The relationship between the input and output data is characterized by a selection process where the output is derived by extracting the last segment of the hierarchical or structured information provided in the input. This process simplifies the complex or multi-level information from the input into a singular, focused piece of information in the output. The transformation from input to output highlights a specific interest in the terminal or most detailed part of the provided information, possibly indicating that the significance or relevance of the data increases with depth in the hierarchy. This relationship suggests a method of data processing where the goal is to isolate a specific piece of detailed information from a broader context for further analysis or use., and input as ['ABCDE/FGHI/JKL/MNOPQR'] output is MNOPQR, input as ['A/ABCDE/FGHI/JKL'] output is JKL, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
