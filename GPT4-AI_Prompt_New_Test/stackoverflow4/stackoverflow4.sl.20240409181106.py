Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Input Summary:

The input data consists of strings that follow a specific format, which includes a prefix and a set of three numerical values enclosed within angle brackets. The prefix is a combination of two characters, where the first character is always "R" and the second character varies among "V", "S", and "B". Following the prefix, there is a specific delimiter "/", and then the numerical values are enclosed within angle brackets "<>". These numerical values are separated by commas. Each set of numerical values represents a distinct combination, with no apparent range restrictions beyond being non-negative integers. The variations in the second character of the prefix and the numerical values suggest a categorization or classification system, possibly indicating different types or groups within the dataset.

### Output Summary:

The output data retains the structure of the input data but with modifications to the format. The prefix remains unchanged, but the delimiter "/" is now followed by a space, and the numerical values are presented without angle brackets and separated by spaces instead of commas. This transformation simplifies the format, making it more readable while preserving the essential components of the input data: the prefix and the numerical values. The output format suggests a standardized way of presenting the data, possibly for easier interpretation or further processing.

### Relationship Summary:

The transformation from input to output data involves a consistent reformatting process that maintains the core information while altering its presentation. The relationship between the input and output can be summarized as follows:

1. **Prefix Preservation:** The two-character prefix is retained without alteration, indicating its importance in both the input and output data. This suggests that the prefix carries significant meaning or classification information that is crucial to the dataset.

2. **Delimiter Modification:** The original delimiter "/" is retained but is now followed by a space in the output. This subtle change enhances readability without affecting the structural integrity of the data.

3. **Bracket Removal and Separator Change:** The angle brackets are removed, and the numerical values are separated by spaces instead of commas in the output. This alteration simplifies the data presentation, making it more straightforward to read and possibly to parse programmatically.

4. **Data Integrity:** Despite the format changes, the integrity of the data—the prefix and the numerical values—is preserved. This indicates that the transformation's primary goal is to enhance data presentation and usability rather than to modify the data itself.

In summary, the relationship between the input and output data is characterized by a consistent format transformation that aims to improve readability and standardization while preserving the essential information contained within the dataset., and input as ['R/V<208,0,32>'] output is R/V 208 0 32, input as ['R/S<184,28,16>'] output is R/S 184 28 16, input as ['R/B<255,88,80>'] output is R/B 255 88 80, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
