Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Input Column Summary:

The input data is composed of two columns, each containing qualitative data. The first column includes strings that represent a numerical value followed by one or more characters, which seem to denote a unit or type (e.g., '80v', '10hrs', '7h', '500m'). These strings suggest a variety of measurements or quantities, potentially indicating values in different contexts or domains such as voltage ('v'), hours ('hrs', 'h'), or meters ('m'). The diversity in the suffixes ('v', 'hrs', 'h', 'm') implies a wide range of applications or settings from which these data points could originate.

The second column contains strings that are purely numerical ('3', '3', '2', '4'). These numbers do not have an immediately apparent connection to the first column's data based on the given examples alone. They could represent a category, a code, or perhaps a modifier that relates to the first column's data in a way not explicitly defined in the provided dataset.

### Output Column Summary:

The output data consists of numerical values (80, 10, 7, 500) that directly correlate to the numerical portion of the strings in the first column of the input data. This suggests that the output is derived by extracting the numerical component from the first column's strings, disregarding any alphabetic characters or units that follow the numbers.

### Relationship Summary:

The relationship between the input and output data can be summarized as a process of extracting and isolating the numerical component from the first column of the input data. The second column of the input data does not appear to influence the output directly, based on the examples provided. The transformation process effectively ignores any non-numerical characters and units present in the first column, focusing solely on converting the initial numerical string into a pure numerical value for the output.

This relationship indicates a method of data processing where the qualitative aspect of the first column (i.e., the unit or type denoted by the characters following the numbers) is not considered relevant for the output. The process could be part of a larger data cleaning or preparation step, where extracting pure numerical values is necessary for subsequent quantitative analysis or operations that require numerical inputs free from qualitative descriptors., and input as ['80v', '3'] output is 80, input as ['10hrs', '3'] output is 10, input as ['7h', '2'] output is 7, input as ['500m', '4'] output is 500, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
