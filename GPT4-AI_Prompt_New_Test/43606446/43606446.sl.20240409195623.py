Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Input Column Summary:

The input data consists of strings that follow a specific format, which can be broken down into several components:

1. **Currency Pair**: The beginning of each string starts with a currency pair, denoted by three-letter currency codes. For example, "USD.EUR" represents a pair of US Dollar and Euro.
2. **Exchange Information**: Following the currency pair, there is information enclosed in angle brackets "<>". This information specifies the exchange platform and the nature of the transaction. In the given examples, "IDEALPRO,CASH" indicates the exchange platform (IDEALPRO) and the transaction type (CASH).
3. **Target Currency**: The last part within the angle brackets is another three-letter currency code, which appears to specify a target currency for the transaction. This part varies across the examples, including "EUR", "USD", "WON", and "YEN".

### Output Column Summary:

The output data consists of three-letter currency codes, such as "EUR", "USD", "WON", and "YEN". These codes represent currencies and are directly related to the input data.

### Relationship Summary:

The relationship between the input and output data is straightforward: the output is determined by the last part of the input string, specifically the target currency specified within the angle brackets. Regardless of the currency pair at the beginning of the input or the exchange information, the output solely depends on this target currency component. This indicates a direct mapping from the specified target currency in the input to the output currency code.

- For inputs specifying "<...CASH,EUR>", the output is "EUR".
- For inputs specifying "<...CASH,USD>", the output is "USD".
- For inputs specifying "<...CASH,WON>", the output is "WON".
- For inputs specifying "<...CASH,YEN>", the output is "YEN".

This pattern suggests that the system or process generating these outputs is designed to extract and output the target currency code from the input string, ignoring other components of the input., and input as ['USD.EUR<IDEALPRO,CASH,EUR>'] output is EUR, input as ['USD.EUR<IDEALPRO,CASH,USD>'] output is USD, input as ['KOR.JPN<IDEALPRO,CASH,WON>'] output is WON, input as ['KOR.JPN<IDEALPRO,CASH,YEN>'] output is YEN, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
