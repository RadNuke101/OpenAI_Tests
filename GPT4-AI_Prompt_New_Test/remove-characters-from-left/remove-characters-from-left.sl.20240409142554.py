Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Input Column Summary:

The input data consists of two columns. The first column contains strings that are a mix of digits and potentially letters or special characters. These strings vary in length and composition, indicating a diverse set of values without a clear pattern in terms of character types included (numeric, alphabetic, or symbolic). The second column contains single-digit numbers, which seem to represent a specific instruction or parameter that is applied to the strings in the first column.

### Output Column Summary:

The output data is a single column that contains strings derived from the first column of the input data. These output strings are shorter than or equal to the corresponding input strings, indicating a process of reduction or extraction has occurred. The output strings retain the character composition (digits, letters, and potentially symbols) of their corresponding input strings, suggesting that the transformation process does not alter the type of characters but rather selects a subset of them.

### Relationship Summary:

The relationship between the input and output columns appears to be governed by a transformation rule that uses the number in the second input column to modify the string in the first input column. Specifically, the number seems to indicate how many characters to remove from the beginning of the first input column's string to produce the output string. For example, an input of ['1234', '1'] produces an output of '234', indicating the first character ('1') was removed. Similarly, ['**512A', '2'] yields '512A', showing the first two characters ('**') were removed.

This transformation rule suggests a straightforward, consistent method for generating the output from the input: count the number of characters specified by the second input column from the start of the first input column's string and remove them, leaving the remainder as the output. This process treats the input data qualitatively, focusing on the structural change to the string rather than interpreting the strings as numerical or other types of data. The rule applies regardless of the character types present in the input strings, making it a versatile method for string manipulation based on a specified parameter., and input as ['1234', '1'] output is 234, input as ['**512A', '2'] output is 512A, input as ['343DMX', '3'] output is DMX, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
