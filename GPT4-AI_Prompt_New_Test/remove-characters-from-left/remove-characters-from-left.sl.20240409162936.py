Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Input Column Summary:

The input data consists of two columns. The first column contains strings that are a mix of digits and potentially letters or special characters. These strings vary in length and composition, indicating a diverse set of alphanumeric sequences. The second column contains single-digit numbers, which are presumably integers. These numbers appear to represent a parameter or a condition that affects the transformation of the strings in the first column.

### Output Column Summary:

The output data is a single column that contains strings derived from the transformation applied to the strings in the first column of the input data. These output strings are subsets of the original strings, where a certain number of characters from the beginning of the original strings have been removed. The characters removed correspond to the number specified in the second column of the input data. The output retains the remaining part of the string from the first column, preserving the order and composition of the characters that were not removed.

### Relationship Summary:

The relationship between the input and output data can be summarized as a transformation process governed by a simple rule: remove a specified number of characters from the beginning of the input string, where the number of characters to be removed is indicated by the value in the second input column. The output is the remainder of the string after this removal process.

- The first column in the input data provides the original string to be transformed.
- The second column in the input data specifies how many characters should be removed from the beginning of the string in the first column.
- The output data is the result of applying this transformation, showing the remaining part of the string after the specified number of characters have been removed.

This transformation process treats the input data qualitatively, focusing on the structural change in the string rather than interpreting the strings as numerical values. The process is consistent across different inputs, indicating a systematic method of generating the output based on the input parameters provided., and input as ['1234', '1'] output is 234, input as ['**512A', '2'] output is 512A, input as ['343DMX', '3'] output is DMX, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
