Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Input Column Summary:

The input data consists of strings that represent lists of project names or categories, separated by commas. These strings vary in length, containing anywhere from a single project name to multiple project names. The project names themselves are qualitative descriptors, potentially indicating the type or name of the project. The variety in the input suggests a categorization based on the presence or absence of certain types of projects or keywords within these strings.

### Output Column Summary:

The output data is binary, consisting of either `true` or `false` values. This binary nature indicates a classification task based on the input data, where the presence or absence of certain criteria within the input strings determines the output value.

### Relationship Summary:

The relationship between the input and output columns suggests a rule-based classification where the presence of specific keywords or the absence thereof in the input strings influences the output value. Specifically:

- When the input string consists solely of project names without the inclusion of certain keywords (e.g., "overhead"), the output tends to be `true`. This suggests that project names or a list of projects are classified positively.
- If the input string includes specific keywords that might not directly relate to project names, such as "overhead," the output is `false`. This indicates a negative classification when non-project related terms or specific excluded terms are present.
- The classification does not seem to be influenced by the number of projects listed in the input string, as both single and multiple project names without excluded keywords result in a `true` output.
- The presence of a mix of project names and excluded keywords within the same input string leads to a `false` output, indicating that the negative classification has precedence when both project names and excluded keywords are present.

In summary, the relationship between the input and output data suggests a filtering mechanism where input strings are classified based on the presence of project-related terms, excluding those with specific non-project related keywords or terms., and input as ['some project,other project'] output is true, input as ['some project'] output is true, input as ['overhead'] output is false, input as ['some project, overhead'] output is false, input as ['some project, other, boo'] output is true, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
