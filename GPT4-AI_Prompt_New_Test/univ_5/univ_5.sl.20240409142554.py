Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Input Column Summary:

The input data consists of two columns, each containing qualitative information about various universities in the United States. The first column lists the names of the universities, which include a mix of full university names (e.g., "University of Pennsylvania") and abbreviations or informal names (e.g., "UCLA" for University of California, Los Angeles). This variety indicates a recognition of institutions by both their formal titles and their commonly used names or nicknames.

The second column provides the location of each university, including the city and state. In some instances, the country ("USA") is also included, while in others, it is omitted. This suggests a variability in how location information is provided, with some entries offering more detail than others. The state names are sometimes fully spelled out (e.g., "New York") and sometimes abbreviated (e.g., "NY"), indicating inconsistency in the presentation of geographical information.

### Output Column Summary:

The output data standardizes the format of the university locations provided in the second input column. Each output entry includes the city, the state abbreviation, and the country ("USA"), ensuring a consistent and concise presentation of location information. This transformation addresses the inconsistencies found in the input data by abbreviating all state names and adding the country when it is missing, thereby making the location information uniform across all entries.

### Relationship Between Input and Output:

The relationship between the input and output data lies in the standardization and clarification of university locations. The process involves:

1. **Standardizing State Names**: Converting full state names to their standard two-letter abbreviations.
2. **Adding Missing Country Information**: Including "USA" in entries where the country was omitted in the input, ensuring that all locations are clearly identified as being in the United States.
3. **Correcting Spelling Errors**: For example, "Phialdelphia" is corrected to "Philadelphia" in the output, indicating an attention to detail and accuracy in the location data.

This transformation enhances the clarity and consistency of the location information, making it easier to understand and compare across different universities. The output data provides a uniform format that is beneficial for databases, directories, and any context where standardized geographical information is necessary., and input as ['University of Pennsylvania', 'Phialdelphia, PA, USA'] output is Phialdelphia, PA, USA, input as ['UCLA', 'Los Angeles, CA'] output is Los Angeles, CA, USA, input as ['Cornell University', 'Ithaca, New York, USA'] output is Ithaca, NY, USA, input as ['Penn', 'Philadelphia, PA, USA'] output is Philadelphia, PA, USA, input as ['University of Maryland College Park', 'College Park, MD'] output is College Park, MD, USA, input as ['University of Michigan', 'Ann Arbor, MI, USA'] output is Ann Arbor, MI, USA, input as ['Columbia University', 'New York, NY, USA'] output is New York, NY, USA, input as ['NYU', 'New York, New York, USA'] output is New York, NY, USA, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
