Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Summary of Input Column Data

The input data consists of strings formatted as a sequence of three groups of three digits each, separated by hyphens (e.g., 'XXX-XXX-XXX'). Each group within the strings appears to be arbitrary and does not follow a discernible pattern based on the provided examples. The input data is qualitative in nature, representing a structured format rather than numerical values that could be used for calculations. The structure of the input data is consistent across all examples, adhering to the pattern of digit groups separated by hyphens.

### Summary of Output Column Data

The output data consists of three-digit numbers (or strings if leading zeros are considered significant, as in the case of '094'). These outputs are extracted from the input data, specifically representing the third group of digits in the input strings. The output data is qualitative, focusing on the specific segment of the input data rather than implying any quantitative relationship or calculation based on the input.

### Relationship Between Input and Output

The relationship between the input and output data is straightforward: the output is directly derived from the input by extracting the third group of digits from the structured input string. There is no transformation or calculation involved in generating the output from the input; it is purely an extraction process. This relationship highlights a pattern where the input data's format dictates the output, with the output consistently being the last segment of the input data, regardless of the specific digits present in each case. This pattern suggests that the input data's primary function, in this context, is to carry the output data within a structured format, possibly for organizational or processing purposes., and input as ['938-242-504'] output is 504, input as ['308-916-545'] output is 545, input as ['623-599-749'] output is 749, input as ['981-424-843'] output is 843, input as ['118-980-214'] output is 214, input as ['244-655-094'] output is 094, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
