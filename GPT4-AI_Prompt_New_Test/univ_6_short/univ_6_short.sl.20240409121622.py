Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Summary for Input Column Data:

The input data consists of two columns, with each row representing a specific university or college and its corresponding location in the United States. The first column includes the names of various higher education institutions, ranging from well-known universities such as the University of Pennsylvania, UCLA (University of California, Los Angeles), Cornell University, and Columbia University, to others like the University of Maryland College Park and the University of Michigan. These names sometimes appear in their full form and other times in abbreviated or colloquial forms, such as "Penn" for the University of Pennsylvania and "NYU" for New York University.

The second column provides the geographical locations of these institutions, including the city, state, and in most cases, the country (USA). The format of the location information varies, with some entries including the state abbreviation and others spelling out the state name in full. Additionally, the country is not consistently mentioned across all entries but is implied to be the USA either explicitly or through context.

### Summary for Output Column Data:

The output data standardizes the format of the geographical locations associated with each institution mentioned in the input data. It consistently presents the city, state abbreviation, and the country (USA) for each location. This standardization addresses variations in the input data, such as the spelling out of state names or the omission of the country, ensuring a uniform presentation of location information across all entries. The output corrects minor errors (e.g., "Phialdelphia" to "Philadelphia") and standardizes state names to their abbreviations, ensuring consistency and clarity in representing the locations of these institutions.

### Relationship Summary:

The relationship between the input and output data involves the process of standardizing and correcting the geographical location information of various higher education institutions in the United States. The input data presents a mix of institution names and their locations in varying formats, reflecting common variations in how such information might be provided or referred to in different contexts. The output data, in contrast, focuses on presenting a clean, standardized format for these locations, emphasizing consistency in the representation of city, state abbreviation, and country. This process involves correcting typographical errors, standardizing state names to their abbreviations, and ensuring the inclusion of the country (USA) in all entries, thereby facilitating a clearer and more uniform understanding of each institution's geographical location., and input as ['University of Pennsylvania', 'Phialdelphia, PA, USA'] output is Phialdelphia, PA, USA, input as ['UCLA', 'Los Angeles, CA'] output is Los Angeles, CA, USA, input as ['Cornell University', 'Ithaca, New York, USA'] output is Ithaca, NY, USA, input as ['Penn', 'Philadelphia, PA, USA'] output is Philadelphia, PA, USA, input as ['University of Maryland College Park', 'College Park, MD'] output is College Park, MD, USA, input as ['University of Michigan', 'Ann Arbor, MI, USA'] output is Ann Arbor, MI, USA, input as ['Columbia University', 'New York, NY, USA'] output is New York, NY, USA, input as ['NYU', 'New York, New York, USA'] output is New York, NY, USA, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
