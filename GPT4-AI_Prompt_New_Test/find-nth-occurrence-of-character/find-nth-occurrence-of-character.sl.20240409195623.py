Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Input Column Summary:

The input data consists of two distinct parts:

1. **Textual Component**: This part is consistent across all examples, indicating a scenario of "replies to _aya, _tasisuke, and _chan". This suggests a context where responses are being made to three entities or individuals named _aya, _tasisuke, and _chan. The presence of these names in every instance implies that the interaction with these entities is a constant factor in the scenario being described.

2. **Numerical Component**: This part varies across the examples, represented by the numbers '1', '2', and '3'. This suggests a quantitative aspect of the scenario that changes from one instance to another. Given the textual context, it could represent a variable factor such as the number of replies or a multiplier affecting the outcome in some way.

### Output Column Summary:

The output data consists of numerical values: 12, 18, and 33. These numbers increase as the numerical component of the input increases, suggesting a direct relationship between the input's numerical component and the output. The progression is not linear, as the increase from the first to the second output is +6, but the increase from the second to the third output is significantly higher, at +15. This indicates that the relationship between the input's numerical component and the output might involve more complex calculations or factors than a simple linear progression.

### Relationship Summary:

The relationship between the input and output data suggests a scenario where the numerical component of the input directly influences the output, likely in a non-linear fashion. The constant textual component sets a consistent context for this relationship, indicating that the variations in output are not due to changes in the entities involved (_aya, _tasisuke, and _chan) but rather due to the changes in the numerical component of the input. This could imply a scenario where the number of replies or the intensity of interaction with the mentioned entities affects the outcome in a complex manner, possibly involving different rates of increase or additional factors that amplify the effect of the numerical input on the output., and input as ['replies to _aya, _tasisuke, and _chan', '1'] output is 12, input as ['replies to _aya, _tasisuke, and _chan', '2'] output is 18, input as ['replies to _aya, _tasisuke, and _chan', '3'] output is 33, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
