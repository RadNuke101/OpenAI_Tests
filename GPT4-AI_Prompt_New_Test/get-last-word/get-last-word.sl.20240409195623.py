Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Summary of Input Column Data:

The input column data consists of short phrases or sentences that appear to convey advice, observations, or questions about life, productivity, and philosophy. Each entry seems to encapsulate a distinct idea or principle, suggesting a focus on wisdom, personal growth, or existential inquiry. The phrases are concise yet loaded with meaning, prompting reflection on various aspects of human experience, from the importance of concentration and the pitfalls of haste to the search for meaning in life. The diversity of topics covered, despite the brevity of each entry, points to a collection of thoughts aimed at provoking deeper consideration of how one approaches life and its challenges.

### Summary of Output Column Data:

The output column data comprises single words that seem to represent the essence or key focus of each corresponding input phrase. These words—time, evil, life—serve as a distilled summary or the pivotal concept of each input statement. They reflect critical themes or values being highlighted in the input data: the importance of time management, the dangers of premature optimization, and the existential quest for the meaning of life. The output words are significant in that they capture the core message or moral of each input phrase, acting as a focal point for the broader ideas being conveyed.

### Relationship Between Input and Output:

The relationship between the input and output columns can be described as one of summarization or extraction of central themes. The output seems to function as a keyword or a thematic anchor for each input phrase, distilling its broader message into a single, impactful word. This process of reduction highlights the essence of the advice, observation, or question posed in the input, making it easier to grasp the fundamental point being made. The choice of output words demonstrates an understanding of the input phrases' key messages, emphasizing the importance of focus, caution against haste, and the existential pursuit of meaning. This relationship underscores the value of distilling complex ideas into their most potent form, facilitating clearer understanding and reflection., and input as ['focus on one thing at a time'] output is time, input as ['premature opt is the root of all evil'] output is evil, input as ['where is life'] output is life, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
