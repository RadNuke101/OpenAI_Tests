Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Summary of Input Column Data

The input data consists of a series of phrases or statements that convey a specific message or principle. Each phrase encapsulates a distinct idea or question, ranging from advice on productivity and warnings about common pitfalls to existential inquiries. These statements are reflective in nature, prompting the reader to consider certain aspects of life, decision-making, and focus. The diversity of the topics covered in the inputs suggests a broad exploration of themes related to life philosophy, personal development, and the search for meaning or direction. The phrases are concise yet loaded with significance, each serving as a potential starting point for deeper reflection or discussion.

### Summary of Output Column Data

The output data comprises single words that appear to be the essence or focal point extracted from each corresponding input phrase. These keywords—'time,' 'evil,' 'life'—are fundamental concepts that resonate with the core message or concern of the input statements. The selection of these words as outputs indicates a process of distillation, where the most critical or impactful element of each input statement is identified and highlighted. These keywords serve as thematic anchors, summarizing the central idea or concern of the input in a succinct manner.

### Relationship Between Input and Output

The relationship between the input and output data can be characterized by a process of abstraction and focus. For each input statement—a complex and nuanced expression of an idea or question—the corresponding output distills this complexity into a single, potent word that captures the essence of the statement. This process demonstrates an analytical approach to understanding and communicating the core themes of the inputs. It reflects an effort to simplify and clarify, making it easier to grasp the fundamental principles or concerns at the heart of each statement. The output, in essence, serves as a keyword or tag that encapsulates the primary focus or lesson of each input, facilitating a quicker comprehension and retention of the message. This relationship underscores the value of focusing on key concepts to derive meaningful insights from broader, more complex discussions or reflections., and input as ['focus on one thing at a time'] output is time, input as ['premature opt is the root of all evil'] output is evil, input as ['where is life'] output is life, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
