Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Summary for Input Column Data:

The input data consists of two columns, each containing personal names. The first column includes given names, while the second column contains surnames. The given names are diverse, representing different cultural backgrounds or origins, indicating a variety of naming conventions. The surnames also show diversity, suggesting a range of ethnicities or nationalities. The data set appears to be a collection of individual names, likely representing a sample of a larger population. Each row combines a given name with a surname, forming a complete personal identity for an individual. The names are qualitative in nature, representing categorical data that identifies or describes individuals without implying any numerical value or order.

### Summary for Output Column Data:

The output data is a transformation of the input data, specifically designed to abbreviate the full names into a more concise format. Each output entry consists of the given name followed by the initial of the surname, ending with a period. This format maintains the individual's identity while providing a level of privacy or brevity. The output is also qualitative, retaining the categorical nature of the input data but in a reduced form. This transformation is consistent across all entries, indicating a systematic approach to generating abbreviated names.

### Relationship Between Input and Output:

The relationship between the input and output data is characterized by a process of abbreviation, where the full surname in the input is reduced to its initial in the output, while the given name remains unchanged. This process suggests a purpose of simplifying the representation of names, possibly for reasons of privacy, ease of reference, or space-saving in documentation. The systematic nature of this transformation indicates a rule-based approach, where the first letter of the surname is retained and appended with a period, following the unchanged given name. This method preserves the essential identity of each individual, as represented by their name, while abbreviating the surname to a single initial. The transformation from input to output demonstrates a clear, consistent pattern of abbreviation applied uniformly across the dataset., and input as ['Nancy', 'FreeHafer'] output is Nancy F., input as ['Andrew', 'Cencici'] output is Andrew C., input as ['Jan', 'Kotas'] output is Jan K., input as ['Mariya', 'Sergienko'] output is Mariya S., , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
