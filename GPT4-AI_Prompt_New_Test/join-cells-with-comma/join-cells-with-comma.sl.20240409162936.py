Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Input Column Summary:

The input data consists of lists of fruit names, where each list represents a collection of different fruits. These fruits are qualitative data, representing categories rather than numerical values. The lists vary in length and may include empty strings, indicating missing or unspecified fruit names. The variety of fruits mentioned across the input lists includes common fruits like apples, mangos, kiwis, and grapes, as well as less commonly mentioned ones like figs. The presence of empty strings suggests that not every list is complete or that some selections of fruits were intentionally left unspecified.

### Output Column Summary:

The output data retains the qualitative nature of the input, listing fruit names without empty strings. It essentially mirrors the input lists but with the omission of any blanks, suggesting a cleaning or filtering process that removes unspecified entries. The output maintains the order of the fruits as they appear in the input, indicating that the transformation from input to output does not rearrange the items but simply excludes the empty or null values. The variety of fruits in the output remains diverse, reflecting the input's diversity minus the incomplete entries.

### Relationship Summary:

The relationship between the input and output data columns is characterized by a filtering or cleaning process. The output is derived from the input by removing any empty strings, which can be interpreted as a data cleaning step to ensure that only specified, valid fruit names are retained for further processing or analysis. This transformation preserves the qualitative nature of the data and the original order of items within each list, ensuring that the output remains true to the input's intent with a more refined, complete dataset. The process does not alter the nature of the data (i.e., it remains qualitative), nor does it introduce new elements or categories; it simply refines the input by excluding incomplete or unspecified entries. This relationship highlights the importance of data cleaning in preparing qualitative data for analysis, ensuring that only meaningful, complete data points are considered., and input as ['figs', '', 'apples'] output is figs, apples, input as ['mangos', 'kiwis', 'grapes'] output is mangos, kiwis, grapes, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
