Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Input Column Summary:

The input data consists of two columns, each containing specific information about various universities in the United States. The first column lists the names of the universities, which include a mix of full university names (e.g., "University of Pennsylvania", "Cornell University", "University of Maryland College Park", "University of Michigan") and abbreviations or informal names (e.g., "UCLA", "Penn"). This variety indicates that the dataset includes both formal and colloquial references to these institutions.

The second column provides the location of each university, including the city and state. In some cases, the country ("USA") is also included, while in others, it is omitted. This suggests variability in the level of detail provided for each university's location.

### Output Column Summary:

The output data is a refined version of the second input column, focusing solely on the location of each university. It standardizes the format by ensuring that each entry includes the city, state, and, where initially omitted, the country ("USA"). This standardization process corrects any misspellings observed in the input (e.g., "Phialdelphia" corrected to "Philadelphia") and adds the country to entries where it was missing, ensuring a consistent format across all entries: "City, State, USA".

### Relationship Summary:

The relationship between the input and output data involves a process of standardization and correction applied to the university locations. The output extracts and refines the location information from the input, ensuring consistency in the presentation of each university's geographical details. This process involves:

1. Correcting any spelling errors in the city names.
2. Standardizing the format to include the city, state, and country, even if the original input did not specify the country.
3. Ignoring the university names in the output, focusing solely on the geographical location.

This transformation ensures that the output provides a uniform and accurate representation of each university's location, making it easier to understand and compare the geographical distribution of these institutions across the United States., and input as ['University of Pennsylvania', 'Phialdelphia, PA, USA'] output is Phialdelphia, PA, USA, input as ['UCLA', 'Los Angeles, CA'] output is Los Angeles, CA, USA, input as ['Cornell University', 'Ithaca, New York, USA'] output is Ithaca, New York, USA, input as ['Penn', 'Philadelphia, PA, USA'] output is Philadelphia, PA, USA, input as ['University of Maryland College Park', 'College Park, MD'] output is College Park, MD, USA, input as ['University of Michigan', 'Ann Arbor, MI, USA'] output is Ann Arbor, MI, USA, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
