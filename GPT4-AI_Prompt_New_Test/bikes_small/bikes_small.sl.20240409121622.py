Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Input Column Summary:

The input data consists of strings that combine a brand name with a numeric value, presumably representing a model or specification related to motorcycles. The brands identified within the input data are "Ducati" and "Honda." The numeric values attached to these brand names vary and include 100, 125, 250, and 550. Each input string is structured consistently, starting with the brand name followed by a numeric value, with no spaces in between. This pattern suggests a systematic naming convention where the brand is immediately followed by a model or specification number.

### Output Column Summary:

The output data extracts and presents only the brand name component from each input string, effectively removing the numeric value that follows the brand name in the input. The output data consists exclusively of the brand names "Ducati" and "Honda," which are derived directly from the input data. There is a direct correlation between the brand name in the input and the output, with the output consistently representing the brand component of the input string.

### Relationship Summary:

The relationship between the input and output data is straightforward and consistent: the output is derived by isolating the brand name from the input string, effectively discarding the numeric value that follows the brand name in the input. This process transforms a combined string of brand name and model/specification number into a simple brand name. The transformation does not alter the brand name itself, nor does it introduce any new elements or variations to the brand names present in the input data. The relationship indicates a clear rule-based extraction where the focus is on identifying and retaining the brand component of the input data, which serves as a qualitative identifier of the motorcycle's manufacturer, irrespective of the specific model or specification denoted by the numeric value in the input., and input as ['Ducati100'] output is Ducati, input as ['Honda125'] output is Honda, input as ['Ducati250'] output is Ducati, input as ['Honda250'] output is Honda, input as ['Honda550'] output is Honda, input as ['Ducati125'] output is Ducati, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
