Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: To summarize the relationship between the input and output data based on the examples provided:

### Input Data Summary:
- The input data consists of strings formatted as three groups of three digits each, separated by hyphens (e.g., '938-242-504').
- Each input string appears to be unique, with no repetitions among the examples given.
- The input data is treated as qualitative, meaning we are looking at it in terms of its structure and composition rather than numerical value.

### Output Data Summary:
- The output data consists of the first group of three digits from the input data (e.g., for '938-242-504', the output is 938).
- The output is also treated as qualitative data, focusing on the pattern of extraction from the input rather than the numerical value of the digits.

### Relationship Summary:
- The relationship between the input and output data is a direct extraction process where the output is always the first group of three digits from the input string.
- This relationship is consistent across all examples, indicating a rule-based extraction rather than a transformation or calculation.
- The process ignores the second and third groups of digits in the input data, focusing solely on the first group for the output.

This summary indicates that the task involves identifying and extracting a specific portion of the input data (the first three digits) to generate the output, treating the data qualitatively to understand the structure and rules governing the relationship between input and output., and input as ['938-242-504'] output is 938, input as ['308-916-545'] output is 308, input as ['623-599-749'] output is 623, input as ['981-424-843'] output is 981, input as ['118-980-214'] output is 118, input as ['244-655-094'] output is 244, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
