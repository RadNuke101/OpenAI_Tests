Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Input Column Summary:

The input data consists of strings formatted as three groups of three digits each, separated by hyphens (e.g., 'XXX-XXX-XXX'). Each entry in the input column follows this consistent pattern, indicating a structured format that likely represents a specific type of information, such as an identification number, a product code, or a similar identifier. The variation in numbers suggests a wide range of values, but without a clear pattern in the changes from one entry to the next. The data is qualitative in nature, as it represents categories or identifiers rather than quantities that can be mathematically manipulated.

### Output Column Summary:

The output data consists of the first group of three digits from the input data, extracted and presented as a separate piece of information. This suggests that the most significant part of the input data, for the purpose of this dataset, is contained within the first group of digits. The output is also qualitative, serving as a category or identifier rather than a numerical value with mathematical properties.

### Relationship Summary:

The relationship between the input and output columns is straightforward: the output is directly derived from the input by extracting the first group of three digits. This indicates that, within the context of this dataset, the initial segment of the input string holds specific importance. The process of deriving the output from the input does not involve any transformation or manipulation of the data beyond this extraction. This could imply that the first set of digits in the input has a distinct significance, such as identifying a primary category, region code, or another key classifier that is necessary for the dataset's intended use or analysis. The rest of the input data, while formatted similarly, is not represented in the output, suggesting it holds secondary importance or is used for further subdivision or specification within the primary category identified by the output., and input as ['938-242-504'] output is 938, input as ['308-916-545'] output is 308, input as ['623-599-749'] output is 623, input as ['981-424-843'] output is 981, input as ['118-980-214'] output is 118, input as ['244-655-094'] output is 244, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
