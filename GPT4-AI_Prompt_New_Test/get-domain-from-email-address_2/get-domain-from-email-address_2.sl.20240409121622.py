Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Input Column Summary:

The input data consists of two columns, each containing qualitative information related to individuals' names and their associated email addresses or identifiers. The first column includes full names, typically structured as a first name followed by a last name, separated by a space. These names appear to be of diverse origins, indicating a variety of cultural backgrounds. The second column contains strings that seem to represent either email addresses or unique identifiers, which do not follow a strict format but often include elements of the names found in the first column, sometimes with modifications or abbreviations. The variations in the structure of these strings include the use of underscores, periods, and different domain extensions, suggesting a personalized or customized approach to creating these identifiers.

### Output Column Summary:

The output data extracts and presents a specific component from the second input column, focusing on a part of the email address or identifier that closely relates to the individual's name. This extracted part varies in its composition; it can be a straightforward abbreviation of the name, a combination of name parts, or the full name with a period separating the first and last names. The output highlights a pattern of deriving identifiers from the individuals' names, though the method of derivation can differ, ranging from simple truncation to more complex transformations that include additional characters like periods or underscores.

### Relationship Summary:

The relationship between the input columns and the output column is characterized by a process of extracting and transforming elements of personal identifiers based on the individuals' names. The output is derived by identifying a segment of the email address or unique identifier that most closely resembles or is derived from the person's name, as provided in the first column. This process indicates a systematic approach to generating personal identifiers from names, where the identifiers retain a recognizable connection to the original name but are adapted to fit the format or requirements of email addresses or unique identifiers. The variations in the output reflect the diversity in the ways names can be incorporated into these identifiers, suggesting a level of customization or personalization in how these identifiers are created., and input as ['ann chang', 'achang_maaker.com'] output is achang, input as ['bobby smith', 'bobt_sphynx.uk.co'] output is bobt, input as ['art lennox', 'art.lennox_svxn.com'] output is art.lennox, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
