Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Summary of Input Column Data:

The input data consists of strings formatted as international phone numbers. Each string begins with a country code prefixed with a plus sign ('+'), followed by a space, and then a sequence of digits separated into three groups by hyphens ('-'). The first group after the country code varies in length, possibly depending on the country code or the specific formatting rules for phone numbers within that country. The second and third groups of digits after the country code are consistently separated by hyphens and appear to contain three or four digits, respectively. The variation in the length of the first group and the consistency in the latter groups suggest a structured approach to phone number formatting that might be influenced by international standards or country-specific rules.

### Summary of Output Column Data:

The output data consists of integers extracted from the input strings. Specifically, these integers are the second group of digits found in the input strings, positioned between the first and second hyphens. The output integers vary in length from three to four digits, reflecting the variation observed in the input data. The extraction of these numbers suggests a focus on a specific segment of the phone number, possibly indicating that this segment holds particular significance or follows a pattern that is of interest.

### Relationship Between Input and Output:

The relationship between the input and output data is characterized by the extraction process where the output is derived directly from a specific portion of the input strings. The output values are consistently the second group of digits in the formatted phone numbers, indicating a rule-based extraction that targets this part of the input. This relationship suggests that the second group of digits in these phone numbers might hold specific importance or relevance to the task at hand, such as identifying a particular code or number sequence that is consistent across different phone numbers regardless of their country code or the first group of digits. The process does not consider the country code or the first and third groups of digits, which implies that the focus is solely on the middle segment of the phone number for the purpose of this data extraction., and input as ['+106 769-858-438'] output is 858, input as ['+83 973-757-831'] output is 757, input as ['+62 647-787-775'] output is 787, input as ['+172 027-507-632'] output is 507, input as ['+72 001-050-856'] output is 050, input as ['+95 310-537-401'] output is 537, input as ['+6 775-969-238'] output is 969, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
