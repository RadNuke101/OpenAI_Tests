Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Summary of Input Column Data

The input data consists of strings formatted as international phone numbers. Each string begins with a country code prefixed with a plus sign ('+'), followed by a space, and then a sequence of digits separated into three groups by hyphens. The first group after the country code varies in length, possibly reflecting different national standards for phone number lengths. The second and third groups of digits are separated by hyphens and appear to be consistent in their placement within the structure of the phone number. The variability in the first group's length and the consistency of the hyphen placement suggest a structured yet flexible format accommodating various international numbering plans.

### Summary of Output Column Data

The output data consists of three-digit numbers extracted from the input strings. Specifically, these numbers are always the second group of digits in the input strings, positioned between the first and second hyphens. This group's consistent extraction as output across different inputs indicates a rule or pattern focusing on this particular segment of the input data.

### Relationship Between Input and Output

The relationship between the input and output data is defined by a consistent pattern where the output is derived from a specific portion of the input. Regardless of the country code or the variability in the length of the first group of digits in the input, the output is always the second group of digits found between the first and second hyphens. This pattern suggests a rule-based extraction process focused on a particular structural element of the input data, ignoring the rest of the information present in the input strings. The extraction process treats the input qualitatively, focusing on the format and position of the data rather than its numerical value or any quantitative aspect. This method of deriving the output highlights a structured approach to handling and interpreting the input data, emphasizing the importance of the data's format and positional context within the string., and input as ['+106 769-858-438'] output is 858, input as ['+83 973-757-831'] output is 757, input as ['+62 647-787-775'] output is 787, input as ['+172 027-507-632'] output is 507, input as ['+72 001-050-856'] output is 050, input as ['+95 310-537-401'] output is 537, input as ['+6 775-969-238'] output is 969, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
