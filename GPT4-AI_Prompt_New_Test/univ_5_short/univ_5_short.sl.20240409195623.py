Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Summary of Input Column Data

The input data consists of two columns, each containing specific information related to various universities in the United States. The first column lists the names of the universities, which include a mix of full university names (e.g., "University of Pennsylvania") and abbreviations or informal names (e.g., "UCLA" for University of California, Los Angeles). This variety indicates a recognition of institutions by both their formal titles and their commonly used names or nicknames. The second column provides the location of these universities, including the city and state. In some instances, the country ("USA") is also mentioned, while in others, it is omitted. This suggests a presumption that the context is primarily within the United States, but there is an inconsistency in specifying the country.

### Summary of Output Column Data

The output data standardizes the format of the university locations provided in the second column of the input data. Each output entry includes the city, the state abbreviation, and "USA" to denote the country, ensuring a uniform presentation of location information across all entries. This standardization addresses the inconsistencies observed in the input data by always including the state abbreviation (even when the full state name was originally provided) and by consistently adding "USA" to all entries, regardless of whether it was initially mentioned. This approach simplifies the location data, making it more concise and easier to understand at a glance.

### Relationship Between Input and Output

The transformation from input to output data demonstrates a process of standardization and simplification of university location information. The relationship between the two sets of data is characterized by the refinement of details to achieve a uniform format that is both concise and informative. The process respects the original information by accurately representing each university's location but modifies the presentation to enhance clarity and consistency. This standardization is particularly useful for applications where a consistent format for location data is necessary, such as databases, directories, or mapping projects. The output effectively distills the essential location details from a variety of input formats, ensuring that the information is easily accessible and comparable across different entries., and input as ['University of Pennsylvania', 'Phialdelphia, PA, USA'] output is Phialdelphia, PA, USA, input as ['UCLA', 'Los Angeles, CA'] output is Los Angeles, CA, USA, input as ['Cornell University', 'Ithaca, New York, USA'] output is Ithaca, NY, USA, input as ['Penn', 'Philadelphia, PA, USA'] output is Philadelphia, PA, USA, input as ['University of Maryland College Park', 'College Park, MD'] output is College Park, MD, USA, input as ['University of Michigan', 'Ann Arbor, MI, USA'] output is Ann Arbor, MI, USA, input as ['Columbia University', 'New York, NY, USA'] output is New York, NY, USA, input as ['NYU', 'New York, New York, USA'] output is New York, NY, USA, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
