Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Input Column 1 Summary (First Names):
The first input column consists of a list of first names, which are diverse in origin and phonetic composition. These names include Launa, Lakenya, Brendan, Bradford, and Rudolf. The variety suggests a multicultural dataset without a specific pattern regarding gender, ethnicity, or linguistic origin. The names range from more common and traditional to less common and possibly unique, indicating a wide spectrum of personal identities.

### Input Column 2 Summary (Last Names):
The second input column contains last names: Withers, Edison, Hage, Lango, and Akiyama. Similar to the first names, these last names are diverse, suggesting a variety of ethnic backgrounds. They range from names that might be more commonly found in English-speaking countries (Withers, Edison) to those that might have origins in other cultures or languages (Akiyama). This diversity further emphasizes the multicultural aspect of the dataset.

### Output Column Summary:
The output column combines elements from both input columns but follows a specific format: it presents the last name followed by a comma, a space, and the first initial of the first name with a period. For example, 'Launa Withers' becomes 'Withers, L.' This format is commonly used in formal, academic, and professional settings to standardize the way names are presented, making it easier to catalog and reference individuals in a consistent manner. The output retains the full last name while reducing the first name to an initial, prioritizing the last name's prominence in the representation.

### Relationship Summary:
The transformation from the input columns to the output column demonstrates a process of standardization and abbreviation commonly found in formal records or publications. The relationship between the input and output data is characterized by a reformatting that maintains the essential identity markers (names) while adapting them to a format that emphasizes the surname and minimizes the first name to an initial. This process could be particularly useful in contexts where space is limited or where there is a need to maintain a focus on family names, such as in academic citations, professional directories, or administrative records. The method preserves the diversity and individuality of the names while ensuring they fit a uniform and widely recognized naming convention., and input as ['Launa', 'Withers'] output is Withers, L., input as ['Lakenya', 'Edison'] output is Edison, L., input as ['Brendan', 'Hage'] output is Hage, B., input as ['Bradford', 'Lango'] output is Lango, B., input as ['Rudolf', 'Akiyama'] output is Akiyama, R., , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
