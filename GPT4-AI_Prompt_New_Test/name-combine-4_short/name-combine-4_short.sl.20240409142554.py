Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Summary for Input Column Data:

#### First Names (Column 1):
The first names provided in the input data are diverse, indicating a variety of cultural backgrounds. Names such as Launa, Lakenya, Brendan, Bradford, and Rudolf suggest a mix of gender and possibly geographical or ethnic origins. This diversity in first names does not follow a specific pattern, indicating that the dataset includes a broad spectrum of individuals without bias towards a particular gender or culture.

#### Last Names (Column 2):
The last names, including Withers, Edison, Hage, Lango, and Akiyama, also reflect a wide range of cultural backgrounds. These surnames suggest a variety of origins, potentially pointing to a multicultural dataset. Similar to the first names, the last names do not indicate a specific pattern or preference, further emphasizing the diversity present in the dataset.

### Summary for Output Column Data:

The output data format consistently transforms the input names into a standardized form, showcasing the last name followed by a comma, a space, and the first initial of the given name. This transformation suggests a formal or professional context where such a naming convention might be preferred, such as in academic citations, professional directories, or formal correspondences. The output format is uniform across all examples, indicating a systematic approach to reformatting names regardless of their cultural origin or complexity. This uniformity in the output highlights the process's ability to standardize diverse inputs into a consistent and formal naming convention.

### Relationship Between Input and Output:

The relationship between the input and output data is characterized by a transformation process that converts full names into a standardized, formal naming convention. This process involves taking diverse and culturally varied full names and reformatting them into a structure that emphasizes the surname, followed by the initial of the first name. The transformation does not alter the cultural integrity or uniqueness of each name but rather applies a uniform formatting rule across all inputs. This indicates an underlying objective to maintain individual identity while adhering to a formal or professional standard that could be universally recognized and applied, regardless of the original name's cultural background., and input as ['Launa', 'Withers'] output is Withers, L., input as ['Lakenya', 'Edison'] output is Edison, L., input as ['Brendan', 'Hage'] output is Hage, B., input as ['Bradford', 'Lango'] output is Lango, B., input as ['Rudolf', 'Akiyama'] output is Akiyama, R., , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
