Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Input Column Summary:

The input data consists of strings that follow a specific format, which includes a timestamp, a phone number, and a text message. The format can be broken down as follows:

- **Timestamp**: The timestamp is given in a specific format, starting with the date (in "Dec 2, 2014," format), followed by the time (in "11=23 PM" format). The date and time are separated by a comma.
- **Phone Number**: After the timestamp, there is a separator ("-"), followed by a phone number. The phone number is prefixed with a country code ("+91") and is followed by a 10-digit number.
- **Text Message**: Following the phone number, there is another separator ("="), and then the text message content, which is a string of text ("loren ipsum" or "loren").

The input data seems to be a log or record of text messages, including when the message was sent, by whom (as indicated by the phone number), and the content of the message.

### Output Column Summary:

The output data retains only a portion of the information from the input data, specifically:

- **Timestamp**: The output preserves the timestamp from the input, including both the date and time, maintaining the original format.
- **Removal of Phone Number and Text Message**: The output omits the phone number and the text message content, focusing solely on the timing of the message.

### Relationship Between Input and Output:

The transformation from input to output demonstrates a process of extracting and preserving specific information while discarding other details. The key points of this relationship are:

- **Focus on Timing**: The process emphasizes the importance of the timing of the messages, suggesting that the exact date and time are crucial for the intended analysis or record-keeping, while the sender's identity and the message content are deemed less relevant.
- **Data Simplification**: The output simplifies the data by removing potentially sensitive or irrelevant information (phone numbers and message content), which could be a measure to protect privacy or to streamline the data for specific analyses that require only the timing of events.
- **Structured Data Extraction**: The consistent format of the input allows for a structured extraction process, indicating that the data transformation is rule-based and designed to operate on a predefined format.

Overall, the relationship between the input and output columns highlights a selective information retention strategy, aimed at focusing on the temporal aspects of the message logs for purposes that likely relate to timing analysis, event tracking, or simplifying records for privacy or efficiency reasons., and input as ['Dec 2, 2014, 11=23 PM - +91 90000 80000= loren ipsum'] output is Dec 2, 2014, 11=23 PM, input as ['Dec 2, 2014, 11=24 PM - +91 90000 80000= loren'] output is Dec 2, 2014, 11=24 PM, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
