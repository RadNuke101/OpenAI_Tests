Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Input Column Summary:

The input data consists of strings that follow a specific format, starting with "geb." followed by a date (comprising a day, month, and year), and in some cases, a location name at the end. The format can be generalized as "geb. DD MMM YYYY [Location]", where "DD" stands for the day, "MMM" for the abbreviated month, "YYYY" for the year, and "[Location]" is an optional part that, when present, typically consists of a place name followed by an abbreviation, possibly indicating a region or locality. The dates vary across the inputs, indicating different events, but the prefix "geb." suggests a common theme or category for these dates, such as a birthdate or another significant event. The presence or absence of a location name varies across the inputs, indicating that the location is an optional component of the data.

### Output Column Summary:

The output data extracts and presents only the location name from the input data, if available. When the input string includes a location name following the date, this location name is isolated and presented as the output. If the input string does not contain a location name, the output is an empty string. This indicates that the primary focus of the output data is on the location information contained within the input strings, disregarding other elements such as the date and the "geb." prefix.

### Relationship Summary:

The relationship between the input and output data is centered around the extraction of location information from a structured string. The process involves identifying and isolating the location name component from the input data, which follows a consistent format starting with "geb.", a date, and optionally ending with a location name. The output is specifically designed to capture only the location information, effectively filtering out the initial "geb." prefix and the date components. This indicates a clear transformation process from a more complex input string to a simplified output that focuses solely on the geographical or locational aspect of the input data. The presence of a location in the output is directly dependent on its presence in the input, demonstrating a selective extraction based on the content of the input strings., and input as ['geb. 14 oct 1956 Westerkerk HRL'] output is Westerkerk HRL, input as ['geb. 14 oct 1956 '] output is , input as ['geb. 15 feb 1987 Westerkerk HRL'] output is Westerkerk HRL, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
