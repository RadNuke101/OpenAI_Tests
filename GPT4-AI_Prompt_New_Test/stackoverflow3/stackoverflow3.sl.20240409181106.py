Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Input Column Summary:

The input data consists of strings that follow a specific format, beginning with "geb." (likely an abbreviation for a term denoting birth or a similar event), followed by a date in the format of day, month (in abbreviated form), and year. After the date, some of the entries include the name of a location, which appears to be a church or a specific place, denoted by a name followed by "HRL". The format is consistent across entries, with variations only in the date and the presence or absence of a location name. The input data seems to be related to birth records or significant events tied to specific dates and possibly locations.

### Output Column Summary:

The output data extracts and presents only the location information from the input data, specifically the name of the place followed by "HRL", when available. If the input data does not include a location name, the output is an empty string. This suggests that the output is focused solely on the location aspect of the input data, disregarding the date and any other information that might be present in the input.

### Relationship Summary:

The relationship between the input and output data is a filtration process where the output isolates and presents only the location information from the input, discarding the date and any introductory text ("geb." and the date). This process highlights the significance of the location information within the input data, suggesting that the location (when present) is of primary interest for the purpose of the data collection or analysis being performed. The consistent format of the input data allows for a straightforward extraction of the location information, indicating that the structure of the input is designed to facilitate this type of filtration. The absence of output for entries without a location name further emphasizes the focus on place-based information within the dataset., and input as ['geb. 14 oct 1956 Westerkerk HRL'] output is Westerkerk HRL, input as ['geb. 14 oct 1956 '] output is , input as ['geb. 15 feb 1987 Westerkerk HRL'] output is Westerkerk HRL, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
