Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Input Column Summary:

The input data consists of two distinct parts in each row, where the first part is a string that appears to follow a consistent pattern, starting with letters (in the provided examples, "z" and "x") followed by a series of numbers (e.g., "66448"). The second part of the input is a single character, which can be either a letter (e.g., "z", "x") or a number (e.g., "6", "4", "8"). This character is intended to be used as a key for some operation on the first part of the input.

### Output Column Summary:

The output data is a modified version of the first part of the input data, where the modification is based on the second part of the input data. Specifically, the output is generated by removing certain characters from the first part of the input. The characters to be removed are determined by the second part of the input. The removal process seems to eliminate all instances of the specified character, regardless of its position in the string.

### Relationship Summary:

The relationship between the input and the output data can be summarized as a character removal operation. The first part of the input acts as the base string from which characters will be removed. The second part of the input specifies which character(s) should be removed from the first part. The output is the result of this removal process.

- When the second part of the input is a letter (e.g., "z" or "x"), the output is the first part of the input with all instances of that letter removed.
- When the second part of the input is a number (e.g., "6", "4", "8"), the output is the first part of the input with all instances of that number removed.
- The operation does not discriminate between letters and numbers; it simply removes all occurrences of the specified character from the string.
- The operation affects all instances of the specified character, indicating a global removal, not just the first occurrence.

This relationship highlights a straightforward character removal process based on the inputs provided, showcasing a simple yet effective method for modifying strings based on specified criteria., and input as ['zx66448', 'z'] output is x66448, input as ['zx66448', 'x'] output is z66448, input as ['zx66448', '6'] output is zx448, input as ['zx66448', '4'] output is zx668, input as ['zx66448', '8'] output is zx6644, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
