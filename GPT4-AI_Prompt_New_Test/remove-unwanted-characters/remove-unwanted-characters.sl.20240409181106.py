Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Input Column Summary:

The input data consists of two distinct parts: a string and a character. The string is consistent across all examples, "zx66448", which appears to be a random combination of letters and numbers. The character, which varies in each example, is extracted from the string itself, indicating that the operation performed on the string involves this character in some way. The characters used are 'z', 'x', '6', '4', and '8', each appearing once in the dataset. This suggests a systematic approach to altering the string based on the character provided.

### Output Column Summary:

The output data is a series of strings that result from some operation applied to the initial string "zx66448" using the characters 'z', 'x', '6', '4', and '8'. The operation affects the structure of the original string, leading to its modification in each case. The modifications include the removal of the specified character in some form, which is evident from the comparison of input and output strings. The specific changes are as follows:
- Removing 'z' leads to "x66448"
- Removing 'x' leads to "z66448"
- Removing '6' leads to "zx448"
- Removing '4' leads to "zx668"
- Removing '8' leads to "zx6644"

### Relationship Summary:

The relationship between the input and output data is based on the removal of specified characters from the original string. The operation seems to target the first occurrence of the character in some cases (e.g., 'z' and 'x'), but in others, it appears to remove all occurrences of the character (e.g., '6', '4', '8'). This suggests a pattern of selective removal based on the character specified in the input. The process transforms the original string "zx66448" by either removing a single instance or all instances of the specified character, resulting in a new string that is outputted. The nature of the removal—whether it's a single instance or all instances—seems to depend on the specific character and possibly its frequency within the original string., and input as ['zx66448', 'z'] output is x66448, input as ['zx66448', 'x'] output is z66448, input as ['zx66448', '6'] output is zx448, input as ['zx66448', '4'] output is zx668, input as ['zx66448', '8'] output is zx6644, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.

    This function takes an original string and a character as inputs.
    It removes the specified character from the original string in a selective manner:
    - If the character is 'z' or 'x', it removes the first occurrence of the character.
