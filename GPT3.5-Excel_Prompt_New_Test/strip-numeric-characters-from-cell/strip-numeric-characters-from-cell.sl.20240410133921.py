'''
Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: remove the numbers from input, and input as ['34653 jim mcdonald'] output is  jim mcdonald, input as ['price is 500'] output is  price is , input as ['100 apples'] output is  apples, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.

# Define the generated function
def generated_function(*args):
    outputs = []
    for arg in args:
        output = ' '.join([word for word in arg.split() if not word.isdigit()])
        outputs.append(output)
    return outputs

# Test cases
print(generated_function('34653 jim mcdonald'))  # Output: jim mcdonald
print(generated_function('price is 500'))  # Output: price is
print(generated_function('100 apples'))  # Output: apples
print(generated_function("34653 jim mcdonald"))  ## Output:  jim mcdonald
print(generated_function("price is 500"))  ## Output:  price is 
print(generated_function("100 apples"))  ## Output:  apples
