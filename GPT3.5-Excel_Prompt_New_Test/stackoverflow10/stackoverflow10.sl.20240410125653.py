Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: return the sequence of 4 numbers (excluding spaces) from input, and input as ['April 1 1799'] output is 1799, input as ['April 11 1867'] output is 1867, input as ['February 12 1806'] output is 1806, input as ['February 21 1798'] output is 1798, input as ['February 28 1844 as Delaware Township'] output is 1844, input as ['February 5 1798'] output is 1798, input as ['February 7 1892 Verona Township'] output is 1892, input as ['February 9 1797'] output is 1797, input as ['January 19 1748'] output is 1748, input as ['July 10 1721 as Upper Penns Neck Township'] output is 1721, input as ['March 15 1860'] output is 1860, input as ['March 17 1870 <as Raritan Township>'] output is 1870, input as ['March 17 1874'] output is 1874, input as ['March 23 1864'] output is 1864, input as ['March 5 1867'] output is 1867, input as ['April 28th 1828'] output is 1828, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
