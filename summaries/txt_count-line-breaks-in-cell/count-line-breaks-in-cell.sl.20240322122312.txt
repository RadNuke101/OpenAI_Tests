For the input column data:

- The input column data consists of strings with a hierarchical structure separated by slashes (/).
- The number of levels in each string corresponds to the count of elements in the hierarchy.
- The summary for the input column data can be generated by counting the number of elements in each string.

For the output column data:

- The output column data consists of integers representing the count of elements in the corresponding input string.
- The summary for the output column can be generated by calculating the total count of elements in all input strings.

Overall Summary:

- The input column data contains hierarchical strings with varying levels of hierarchy.
- The output column data represents the count of elements in each input string.
- The summary provides insights into the structure and complexity of the input data, as well as the corresponding output values.
