- The input column data consists of phone numbers in the format '+XX YYY-ZZZ-ZZZ', where XX is the country code, YYY is the area code, and ZZZ-ZZZ is the phone number.
- The area code is the middle part of the phone number that we are interested in extracting for the output.
- The area code varies in length and is located between the country code and the phone number in each input.

Summary for Output Column Data:
- The output column data consists of the extracted area codes from the input phone numbers.
- The area codes are the middle part of the phone numbers and are the focus of the extraction process.
- Each output represents the area code extracted from the corresponding input phone number.

Overall Summary:
- The task involves extracting the area code from phone numbers provided in the input column data.
- The extracted area codes are then displayed in the output column data.
- The process is consistent across all rows, with the area code being the central element of interest.
- The summaries provide a clear overview of the input data, output data, and the extraction process involved in this task.
