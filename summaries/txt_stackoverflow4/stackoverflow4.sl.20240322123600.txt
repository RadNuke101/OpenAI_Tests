For the input column data:

1. The input column data consists of three different types of strings: 'R/V', 'R/S', and 'R/B'.
2. Each string is followed by three sets of numbers enclosed in angle brackets.
3. The numbers within the angle brackets represent three different values for each string.

For the output column data:

1. The output column data consists of three sets of numbers separated by spaces.
2. Each set of numbers corresponds to the three values extracted from the input column data.
3. The values represent different color components (e.g., red, green, blue) in the RGB color model.

Overall, the input column data contains color codes represented by different strings, while the output column data displays the corresponding RGB values extracted from the input data.
