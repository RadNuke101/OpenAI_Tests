Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Input Column Summary:

The input data consists of two columns, each containing a series of names. The first column appears to contain given names (first names), while the second column contains surnames (last names). The names span a variety of cultural backgrounds, indicating a diverse dataset. The given names include both traditionally male and female names, such as "Launa," "Lakenya," "Brendan," "Bradford," "Rudolf," and "Lara." The surnames also show diversity, including "Withers," "Edison," "Hage," "Lango," "Akiyama," and "Constable." This diversity suggests that the dataset does not focus on a specific geographic or cultural group but rather encompasses a broad range of name types.

### Output Column Summary:

The output data reorganizes the input names into a single column, following the format "Surname GivenName." This transformation suggests a reversal of the conventional Western naming order, where the given name usually precedes the surname. The output maintains the integrity of the individual names but changes their presentation order. This could be useful in contexts where the surname-first format is preferred, such as in many East Asian cultures or in formal and academic settings where surnames are emphasized. The output retains the diversity of the input data, ensuring that the wide range of cultural backgrounds is still represented.

### Relationship Between Input and Output:

The relationship between the input and output data is a simple transformation of the order in which names are presented. The process takes a pair of names from the input, with the first name being the given name and the second name being the surname, and swaps their positions to produce the output. This transformation does not alter the names themselves but changes how they are organized, moving from a "GivenName Surname" format to a "Surname GivenName" format. This reordering could be particularly relevant in contexts where the emphasis is on the family name or where a formal listing of names is required. The process is consistent across all examples, indicating a systematic approach to reformatting the names without introducing any modifications to the names themselves., and input as ['Launa', 'Withers'] output is Withers Launa, input as ['Lakenya', 'Edison'] output is Edison Lakenya, input as ['Brendan', 'Hage'] output is Hage Brendan, input as ['Bradford', 'Lango'] output is Lango Bradford, input as ['Rudolf', 'Akiyama'] output is Akiyama Rudolf, input as ['Lara', 'Constable'] output is Constable Lara, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
