Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Input Column Data Summary:

The input data consists of two columns, each containing a series of names. The first column appears to contain given names, which are diverse in origin and suggest a variety of cultural backgrounds. Names such as "Launa," "Lakenya," "Brendan," "Bradford," "Rudolf," and "Lara" are present, indicating a mix of gender and possibly ethnic diversity. The second column contains what appear to be surnames, including "Withers," "Edison," "Hage," "Lango," "Akiyama," and "Constable." These surnames also suggest a variety of cultural origins, ranging from English to Japanese. The data in these columns is qualitative, focusing on the categorization and identification of individuals through their names.

### Output Column Data Summary:

The output data reorganizes the input names into a single column by swapping the positions of the given names and surnames. The format is consistent across all entries, with the surname from the input's second column now leading, followed by the given name from the input's first column. This transformation results in outputs such as "Withers Launa," "Edison Lakenya," "Hage Brendan," "Lango Bradford," "Akiyama Rudolf," and "Constable Lara." The output maintains the diversity of names but presents them in a reversed order, emphasizing the surname before the given name.

### Relationship Between Input and Output:

The relationship between the input and output data is a systematic reordering of names from a given name-surname format to a surname-given name format. This transformation does not alter the names themselves but changes their presentation order. This reordering could reflect cultural preferences for listing names, organizational requirements, or simply a stylistic choice. The process is consistent across all entries, indicating a rule-based approach to handling the data. The qualitative nature of the data remains unchanged, with the emphasis still on the identification and categorization of individuals through their names, albeit in a reversed order., and input as ['Launa', 'Withers'] output is Withers Launa, input as ['Lakenya', 'Edison'] output is Edison Lakenya, input as ['Brendan', 'Hage'] output is Hage Brendan, input as ['Bradford', 'Lango'] output is Lango Bradford, input as ['Rudolf', 'Akiyama'] output is Akiyama Rudolf, input as ['Lara', 'Constable'] output is Constable Lara, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.

print(generated_function("Rudolf", "Akiyama"))  ## Output: Akiyama Rudolf
print(generated_function("Lara", "Constable"))  ## Output: Constable Lara
