Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Input Column Data Summary:

The input data consists of two columns, each containing a list of names. The first column appears to contain given names, which are diverse and include both traditionally masculine and feminine names such as "Launa," "Lakenya," "Brendan," "Bradford," "Rudolf," and "Lara." These names vary in origin and are indicative of a wide cultural spectrum. The second column contains surnames such as "Withers," "Edison," "Hage," "Lango," "Akiyama," and "Constable." These surnames also reflect a diversity in origin, suggesting a multicultural dataset. The names in both columns are unique in this dataset, with no repetitions observed.

### Output Column Data Summary:

The output data is a single column that combines the names from the two input columns but in reversed order, placing the surname before the given name. For instance, "Launa Withers" from the input columns is transformed into "Withers Launa" in the output. This pattern is consistent across all entries, indicating a systematic approach to reordering the names. The output retains the diversity and multicultural aspect of the input data, now presented in a format that emphasizes the surname before the given name.

### Relationship Summary:

The relationship between the input and output data is a straightforward transformation where the position of the given name and surname is swapped. This process does not alter the names themselves but changes their sequence. This transformation could be reflective of different cultural practices regarding the order of names, where in some contexts, the surname is given prominence by being placed before the given name. The systematic nature of this transformation across all entries suggests an intentional reformatting to either meet a specific data presentation requirement or to align with cultural naming conventions that prioritize the surname. This reordering does not discriminate based on the apparent gender of the given name or the origin of the surname, applying uniformly to all entries in the dataset., and input as ['Launa', 'Withers'] output is Withers Launa, input as ['Lakenya', 'Edison'] output is Edison Lakenya, input as ['Brendan', 'Hage'] output is Hage Brendan, input as ['Bradford', 'Lango'] output is Lango Bradford, input as ['Rudolf', 'Akiyama'] output is Akiyama Rudolf, input as ['Lara', 'Constable'] output is Constable Lara, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
