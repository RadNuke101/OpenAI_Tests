Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Summary for Input Column Data:

The input data consists of two columns, each containing a series of first names and last names, respectively. The first names vary in origin and phonetic complexity, suggesting a diverse set of backgrounds. Names like "Launa," "Lakenya," "Brendan," "Bradford," "Rudolf," and "Lara" indicate a wide range of cultural influences. Similarly, the last names such as "Withers," "Edison," "Hage," "Lango," "Akiyama," and "Constable" also display a variety of origins, from English to Japanese. This diversity in both columns suggests that the dataset might be representing individuals from various ethnic and cultural backgrounds, without any apparent pattern or grouping based on the names alone.

### Summary for Output Column Data:

The output data combines the first and last names from the input columns into full names, maintaining the order in which they were presented. The format "FirstName LastName" is consistently applied across all entries, resulting in a straightforward, unified representation of individual identities. This transformation from separated first and last names into combined full names facilitates easier identification and reference to each individual, enhancing readability and utility for purposes where full names are required.

### Relationship Between Input and Output:

The relationship between the input and output data is a direct transformation process, where two separate pieces of qualitative information (first name and last name) are merged into a single piece of information (full name). This process does not alter the original data but restructures it into a more commonly used format. The output retains all original information from the input, ensuring no loss of data. This transformation is useful in contexts where full names are more practical or necessary, such as in formal documentation, communication, or databases where distinguishing between individuals is crucial. The method of combining the names is consistent and does not discriminate based on the origin or complexity of the names, highlighting a uniform approach to data handling., and input as ['Launa', 'Withers'] output is Launa Withers, input as ['Lakenya', 'Edison'] output is Lakenya Edison, input as ['Brendan', 'Hage'] output is Brendan Hage, input as ['Bradford', 'Lango'] output is Bradford Lango, input as ['Rudolf', 'Akiyama'] output is Rudolf Akiyama, input as ['Lara', 'Constable'] output is Lara Constable, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
