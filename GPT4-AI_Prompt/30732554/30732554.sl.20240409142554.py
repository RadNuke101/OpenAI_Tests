Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Summary of Input Column Data

The input column data consists of strings that appear to represent identifiers, possibly for items, tools, or components. These identifiers follow a pattern where they start with a combination of letters (which could represent a category or type) followed by a hyphen and a series of numbers, which likely serve as a unique identifier within that category. In some cases, the identifier is followed by additional information separated by a vertical bar (`|`). This additional information could represent specifications, such as dimensions (e.g., "10MM") or other characteristics (e.g., "76DK"). There are also instances where the input is simply "N/A", indicating a lack of applicable data or an exception case. Overall, the input data seems to mix standardized identification codes with optional, variable specifications or characteristics.

### Summary of Output Column Data

The output column data retains the core identifier from the input data, stripping away any additional specifications or characteristics that were present. This results in a cleaner, more uniform set of identifiers that likely serve as a standardized reference. The output data maintains the initial letter(s) and number sequence, effectively ignoring any supplementary information or formatting (such as spaces or additional characters beyond the vertical bar). In cases where the input was "N/A", the output remains unchanged, indicating a direct carryover of exception cases without alteration.

### Relationship Between Input and Output

The transformation from input to output data represents a process of standardization or normalization, where the primary goal is to extract the essential identifier from a potentially more complex string. This process suggests that the additional information present in some input data entries, while potentially valuable in certain contexts, is not necessary for the purposes that the output data serves. The relationship underscores a filtering or simplification operation, focusing on maintaining a consistent, easily referenceable set of identifiers. This could be particularly useful in scenarios where a high-level overview or cataloging of items is required, without the need for detailed specifications at the same stage of processing or analysis. The method ensures that regardless of the variability in the input data's format or content, the output remains uniform and aligned with a predefined standard of identification., and input as ['TL-18273982| 10MM'] output is TL-18273982, input as ['TL-288762| 76DK'] output is TL-288762, input as ['CT-576'] output is CT-576, input as ['N/A'] output is N/A, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
