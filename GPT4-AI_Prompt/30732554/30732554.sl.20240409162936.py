Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Summary of Input Column Data:

The input column data consists of strings that appear to represent identifiers, possibly for items, tools, or components. These strings are formatted in a way that typically includes a two-letter prefix followed by a hyphen and a sequence of numbers. In some cases, additional information is appended to the identifier, separated by a vertical bar (`|`) and a space. This additional information varies in format, including alphanumeric combinations (e.g., "10MM", "76DK") and does not follow a consistent pattern across the inputs. The presence of "N/A" as an input suggests that the dataset may include entries that are not applicable or for which the identifier is not available. The input data is qualitative, with each entry representing a unique identifier or status (in the case of "N/A").

### Summary of Output Column Data:

The output column data retains the core identifier from the input data, stripping away any additional information that may have been appended after the vertical bar in the input. The output preserves the two-letter prefix and the sequence of numbers, maintaining the essential part of the identifier intact. In the case of "N/A", the output remains unchanged, indicating that entries marked as not applicable or unavailable in the input are directly carried over to the output without modification. This suggests that the transformation process focuses on extracting the primary identifier while discarding supplementary details that are not consistent across the dataset.

### Relationship Between Input and Output:

The transformation from input to output involves a process of simplification and standardization of the data. The primary operation is the extraction of the core identifier from the input string, effectively removing any additional, potentially variable information that follows the core identifier. This process indicates a standardization effort, possibly aimed at ensuring consistency in how identifiers are represented across the dataset. The relationship between the input and output data is characterized by a filtering action that isolates the most significant component of the input (the identifier) and discards the rest. This suggests that the output is intended to provide a clean, uniform set of identifiers that can be more easily compared, analyzed, or processed further, without the complications introduced by the variable additional information present in the input., and input as ['TL-18273982| 10MM'] output is TL-18273982, input as ['TL-288762| 76DK'] output is TL-288762, input as ['CT-576'] output is CT-576, input as ['N/A'] output is N/A, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
