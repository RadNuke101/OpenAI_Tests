Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Input Column Summary:

The input column consists of strings that appear to represent some form of identifiers or codes, possibly related to items, transactions, or entities. These strings are structured in a way that they may include a prefix (often two letters followed by a hyphen), a series of numbers, and in some cases, additional alphanumeric characters or symbols after a vertical bar. The presence of a vertical bar (`|`) seems to indicate additional information or specifications related to the identifier, such as measurements or other descriptors (e.g., "10MM", "76DK"). However, this additional information varies significantly in format and content, suggesting a lack of uniformity in how these details are presented. The input data also includes instances where the identifier is simply "N/A", indicating a lack of applicable data or an unspecified identifier.

### Output Column Summary:

The output column contains the processed or simplified versions of the input identifiers, where the primary focus is on retaining the core identifier while excluding any additional information or specifications that may have been present after the vertical bar in the input. The output retains the prefix and the series of numbers that form the main part of the identifier, effectively standardizing the format across all entries. This process simplifies the identifiers to a more uniform and concise format, which could be beneficial for cataloging, referencing, or data management purposes. The case of "N/A" in the input is directly carried over to the output without alteration, maintaining the indication of unspecified or non-applicable data.

### Relationship Between Input and Output:

The relationship between the input and output columns highlights a process of simplification and standardization of identifiers. The transformation from input to output involves extracting the essential part of the identifier (prefix and number sequence) and discarding any additional specifications or details that are not consistent across all entries. This process suggests an intention to create a uniform identifier format that can be more easily managed, referenced, or analyzed, without the variability introduced by the additional specifications in the input. The direct carryover of "N/A" entries from input to output indicates a preservation of data integrity, acknowledging instances where an identifier is not applicable or available. This relationship underscores a focus on maintaining core identifier information while streamlining data for consistency and ease of use., and input as ['TL-18273982| 10MM'] output is TL-18273982, input as ['TL-288762| 76DK'] output is TL-288762, input as ['CT-576'] output is CT-576, input as ['N/A'] output is N/A, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
