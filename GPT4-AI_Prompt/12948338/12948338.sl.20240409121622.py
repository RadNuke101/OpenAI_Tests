Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Input Column Summary:

The input data consists of two primary elements: a string of text and a target word. The text strings are composed of sentences that include various words, among which are specific instances of usernames or words prefixed with an underscore (_). These underscore-prefixed words are of particular interest as they seem to be the focus of the search within each string. The target word provided alongside each string is the word of interest, for which the occurrences are to be counted within the string. However, it's important to note that the target word is provided without the underscore prefix, implying that the search is specifically for occurrences of this word when it is prefixed with an underscore within the string. The examples provided indicate a variety of contexts and frequencies for the target words, showcasing the need to accurately identify and count these specific instances.

### Output Column Summary:

The output data is a set of integers, each representing the count of occurrences of the target word (with an underscore prefix) within the respective input string. These numbers vary based on the frequency of the target word's occurrence in its underscore-prefixed form within each string. The output directly correlates with the input data, providing a quantitative measure of the presence of the specified target word in the context of the given text string.

### Relationship Summary:

The relationship between the input and output data is a direct function of the occurrence counting process, where the input data provides the context (text string and target word), and the output data delivers the result of this specific search operation. The process involves scanning the input text string for instances of the target word that are prefixed with an underscore, indicating a particular emphasis or a special identifier (such as a username) within the text. The output's numerical value directly corresponds to how many times this underscore-prefixed target word appears in the input string. This relationship highlights the importance of the underscore prefix in identifying and counting the occurrences of the target word within the text, serving a specific search criterion that ties the input to the output in a clear, quantifiable manner., and input as ['An example string with _username in it RT _AwesomeUser says _username is awesome', 'username'] output is 2, input as ['An example string with _username in it RT _AwesomeUser says _username is awesome', 'AwesomeUser'] output is 1, input as ['An _example string with _example in it is awesome _example', 'example'] output is 3, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
