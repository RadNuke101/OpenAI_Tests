Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Input Column Summary:

The input data consists of two primary components per entry:

1. **Text Strings**: These are sentences or phrases that contain a mix of regular words and special tokens. The special tokens are identifiable by the underscore character `_` preceding a word, which seems to denote a specific type of entity or identifier within the text, possibly a username or a keyword.

2. **Keywords**: The second part of each input is a single word that appears to be the focus of the search or analysis within the text string. This keyword does not have the underscore prefix in the input, suggesting that the analysis might be about finding occurrences of this keyword when it is preceded by an underscore within the text strings.

The text strings are structured in a way that mimics social media posts or messages, with references to users (denoted by the underscore prefix) and actions or opinions about these users. The presence of terms like "RT" (retweet) further supports the social media context of the text.

### Output Column Summary:

The output data consists of integers that represent the count of occurrences of the specified keyword (from the second part of the input) within the text string, but only when the keyword is preceded by an underscore. This suggests a specific interest in occurrences of the keyword in a particular context, likely as identifiers or mentions within the text, rather than as part of the general text content.

### Relationship Summary:

The relationship between the input and output data can be summarized as follows:

- The task involves analyzing text strings for specific occurrences of keywords that are marked in a special way, specifically by an underscore prefix.
- The analysis is focused on counting how many times a given keyword, when preceded by an underscore, appears within each text string.
- The output is directly related to the presence and frequency of these specially marked keywords within the text, indicating a targeted search or analysis rather than a broad examination of the text content.
- This process mimics common operations in text analysis and data mining, especially in contexts like social media, where usernames or specific tags are often marked distinctly and their frequency of mention can be of interest.

In essence, the given data and the relationship between its components suggest a scenario where the analysis is aimed at understanding the engagement or mention of specific entities (like users) within textual data, with a methodology that specifically targets marked identifiers within the text., and input as ['An example string with _username in it RT _AwesomeUser says _username is awesome', 'username'] output is 2, input as ['An example string with _username in it RT _AwesomeUser says _username is awesome', 'AwesomeUser'] output is 1, input as ['An _example string with _example in it is awesome _example', 'example'] output is 3, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
