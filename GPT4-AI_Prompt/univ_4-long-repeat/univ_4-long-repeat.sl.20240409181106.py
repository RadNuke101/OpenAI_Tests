Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Summary of Input Column Data:

The input data consists of pairs of strings, where each pair includes the name of a higher education institution followed by its associated location. These institutions range from universities known for their comprehensive research capabilities and extensive academic offerings, such as the University of Pennsylvania, MIT, and Harvard University, to those more specialized or regionally recognized, like Rice University and the University of Connecticut. The locations provided alongside these institutions' names vary in specificity but generally include a city and state abbreviation, with some entries also including the country (USA). Notably, the data reflects a diversity of geographic locations across the United States, from the East Coast (e.g., New York, NY; Philadelphia, PA) to the West Coast (e.g., Berkeley, CA; Los Angeles, CA), and includes both urban centers and smaller towns known primarily for hosting these institutions (e.g., Ithaca, NY; Ann Arbor, MI).

### Summary of Output Column Data:

The output data standardizes the format of the location information associated with each institution from the input data. Regardless of the initial format, each output entry is structured as "City, State Abbreviation, USA," ensuring consistency across all entries. This standardization process involves correcting misspellings (e.g., "Phialdelphia" to "Philadelphia"), abbreviating state names according to common conventions (e.g., "New York" to "NY"), and appending ", USA" to entries that originally omitted the country. The output thus provides a uniform representation of the locations, facilitating easier recognition and comparison of the geographical distribution of these institutions across the United States.

### Relationship between Input and Output:

The transformation from input to output data demonstrates a process of standardization and correction aimed at achieving uniformity and accuracy in representing the locations of various higher education institutions in the USA. The input data's variability in format and occasional inaccuracies are streamlined in the output to a consistent format that is both concise and informative. This process underscores the importance of having a standardized format for location data, especially when dealing with a diverse set of entries that might originally include variations in spelling, abbreviation, and completeness of the geographical information provided., and input as ['UC Berkeley', 'Berkeley, CA'] output is Berkeley, CA, USA, input as ['University of Pennsylvania', 'Phialdelphia, PA, USA'] output is Phialdelphia, PA, USA, input as ['Cornell University', 'Ithaca, New York, USA'] output is Ithaca, NY, USA, input as ['Penn', 'Philadelphia, PA, USA'] output is Philadelphia, PA, USA, input as ['University of Michigan', 'Ann Arbor, MI, USA'] output is Ann Arbor, MI, USA, input as ['UC Berkeley', 'Berkeley, CA'] output is Berkeley, CA, USA, input as ['MIT', 'Cambridge, MA'] output is Cambridge, MA, USA, input as ['University of Pennsylvania', 'Phialdelphia, PA, USA'] output is Phialdelphia, PA, USA, input as ['UCLA', 'Los Angeles, CA'] output is Los Angeles, CA, USA, input as ['University of Maryland College Park', 'College Park, MD'] output is College Park, MD, USA, input as ['University of Michigan', 'Ann Arbor, MI, USA'] output is Ann Arbor, MI, USA, input as ['UC Berkeley', 'Berkeley, CA'] output is Berkeley, CA, USA, input as ['MIT', 'Cambridge, MA'] output is Cambridge, MA, USA, input as ['Rice University', 'Houston, TX'] output is Houston, TX, USA, input as ['Yale University', 'New Haven, CT, USA'] output is New Haven, CT, USA, input as ['Columbia University', 'New York, NY, USA'] output is New York, NY, USA, input as ['NYU', 'New York, New York, USA'] output is New York, NY, USA, input as ['Drexel University', 'Philadelphia, PA'] output is Philadelphia, PA, USA, input as ['UC Berkeley', 'Berkeley, CA'] output is Berkeley, CA, USA, input as ['UIUC', 'Urbana, IL'] output is Urbana, IL, USA, input as ['Temple University', 'Philadelphia, PA'] output is Philadelphia, PA, USA, input as ['Harvard University', 'Cambridge, MA, USA'] output is Cambridge, MA, USA, input as ['University of Connecticut', 'Storrs, CT, USA'] output is Storrs, CT, USA, input as ['Drexel University', 'Philadelphia, PA'] output is Philadelphia, PA, USA, input as ['NYU', 'New York, New York, USA'] output is New York, NY, USA, input as ['UIUC', 'Urbana, IL'] output is Urbana, IL, USA, input as ['New Haven University', 'New Haven, CT, USA'] output is New Haven, CT, USA, input as ['University of California, Santa Barbara', 'Santa Barbara, CA, USA'] output is Santa Barbara, CA, USA, input as ['University of Connecticut', 'Storrs, CT, USA'] output is Storrs, CT, USA, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
