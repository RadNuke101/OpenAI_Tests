Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Input Column Summary:

The input data consists of two columns, each containing strings. The first column lists the names of various educational institutions, primarily universities and colleges located in the United States. These institutions range from well-known universities with global recognition, such as "Harvard University," "MIT," and "UC Berkeley," to more specialized or less internationally known institutions. The names in this column sometimes use abbreviations (e.g., "MIT" for Massachusetts Institute of Technology, "NYU" for New York University, "UCLA" for University of California, Los Angeles) or informal names (e.g., "Penn" for the University of Pennsylvania).

The second column provides the geographical locations of these institutions, formatted as city and state combinations within the USA. In some instances, the state abbreviation is used (e.g., "CA" for California), while in others, the full state name is provided (e.g., "New York"). Notably, the country name ("USA") is included in some entries but omitted in others.

### Output Column Summary:

The output data is a standardized format of the geographical locations associated with the educational institutions mentioned in the first column of the input data. This output consistently presents the location in the format of "City, State Abbreviation, USA," ensuring uniformity across all entries. It corrects inconsistencies found in the input data, such as varying formats for state names (abbreviating or spelling out the full name) and the occasional omission of the country name. The output also corrects a spelling error found in the input data ("Phialdelphia" is corrected to "Philadelphia").

### Relationship Between Input and Output:

The transformation from input to output demonstrates a process of standardization and correction of geographical location data associated with various educational institutions. The primary goal is to ensure that each location is presented in a consistent format that is easily recognizable and usable for any purpose that requires standardized location information. This process involves:

1. **Standardizing State Names**: Converting full state names to their standard two-letter abbreviations.
2. **Adding Missing Country Names**: Ensuring that "USA" is included in every output entry, even if it was omitted in the input.
3. **Correcting Errors**: Fixing spelling mistakes in city names as seen in the input data.
4. **Maintaining Consistency**: Regardless of how the institution's name is provided (formal name, abbreviation, or informal name), the output focuses solely on the geographical location in a uniform format.

This summary highlights the importance of data standardization, especially when dealing with geographical information that may be presented in various formats. The process enhances data clarity, usability, and accuracy, which is crucial for any analysis or application that relies on precise location data., and input as ['UC Berkeley', 'Berkeley, CA'] output is Berkeley, CA, USA, input as ['University of Pennsylvania', 'Phialdelphia, PA, USA'] output is Phialdelphia, PA, USA, input as ['Cornell University', 'Ithaca, New York, USA'] output is Ithaca, NY, USA, input as ['Penn', 'Philadelphia, PA, USA'] output is Philadelphia, PA, USA, input as ['University of Michigan', 'Ann Arbor, MI, USA'] output is Ann Arbor, MI, USA, input as ['UC Berkeley', 'Berkeley, CA'] output is Berkeley, CA, USA, input as ['MIT', 'Cambridge, MA'] output is Cambridge, MA, USA, input as ['University of Pennsylvania', 'Phialdelphia, PA, USA'] output is Phialdelphia, PA, USA, input as ['UCLA', 'Los Angeles, CA'] output is Los Angeles, CA, USA, input as ['University of Maryland College Park', 'College Park, MD'] output is College Park, MD, USA, input as ['University of Michigan', 'Ann Arbor, MI, USA'] output is Ann Arbor, MI, USA, input as ['UC Berkeley', 'Berkeley, CA'] output is Berkeley, CA, USA, input as ['MIT', 'Cambridge, MA'] output is Cambridge, MA, USA, input as ['Rice University', 'Houston, TX'] output is Houston, TX, USA, input as ['Yale University', 'New Haven, CT, USA'] output is New Haven, CT, USA, input as ['Columbia University', 'New York, NY, USA'] output is New York, NY, USA, input as ['NYU', 'New York, New York, USA'] output is New York, NY, USA, input as ['Drexel University', 'Philadelphia, PA'] output is Philadelphia, PA, USA, input as ['UC Berkeley', 'Berkeley, CA'] output is Berkeley, CA, USA, input as ['UIUC', 'Urbana, IL'] output is Urbana, IL, USA, input as ['Temple University', 'Philadelphia, PA'] output is Philadelphia, PA, USA, input as ['Harvard University', 'Cambridge, MA, USA'] output is Cambridge, MA, USA, input as ['University of Connecticut', 'Storrs, CT, USA'] output is Storrs, CT, USA, input as ['Drexel University', 'Philadelphia, PA'] output is Philadelphia, PA, USA, input as ['NYU', 'New York, New York, USA'] output is New York, NY, USA, input as ['UIUC', 'Urbana, IL'] output is Urbana, IL, USA, input as ['New Haven University', 'New Haven, CT, USA'] output is New Haven, CT, USA, input as ['University of California, Santa Barbara', 'Santa Barbara, CA, USA'] output is Santa Barbara, CA, USA, input as ['University of Connecticut', 'Storrs, CT, USA'] output is Storrs, CT, USA, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
