Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Input Column Summary:

The input data consists of two columns, each containing strings. The first column lists the names of various educational institutions, primarily universities and colleges located in the United States. These institutions range from well-known universities with global recognition, such as "Harvard University," "MIT," and "UC Berkeley," to more specialized or less internationally known institutions. The names provided are either the full formal names of the universities (e.g., "University of Michigan") or their commonly used abbreviations or informal names (e.g., "MIT" for Massachusetts Institute of Technology, "NYU" for New York University).

The second column provides the geographical location of these institutions, specified by the city and state. In some instances, the country ("USA") is also included, while in others, it is omitted. The state names are sometimes given in their full form (e.g., "New York") and sometimes as their standard two-letter postal abbreviations (e.g., "NY"). There is a notable variation in the level of detail and format used to describe these locations.

### Output Column Summary:

The output data is a standardized format of the geographical locations associated with the educational institutions mentioned in the first column of the input data. Each output string is formatted as "City, State Abbreviation, USA," ensuring a consistent presentation of the location information. This standardization process involves several key adjustments:

1. **State Names to Abbreviations:** Full state names are converted to their standard two-letter postal abbreviations (e.g., "New York" becomes "NY").
2. **Inclusion of Country:** The country "USA" is explicitly added to each location, ensuring clarity about the country where the institution is based, even if it was omitted in the input.
3. **Correction of Typos:** Any typographical errors in the city names observed in the input (e.g., "Phialdelphia" instead of "Philadelphia") are not corrected in the output, indicating that the focus is on standardizing the format rather than correcting spelling errors.
4. **Consistency in Format:** Regardless of the variation in the level of detail or format in the input, the output maintains a uniform format for all entries.

### Relationship Between Input and Output:

The transformation from input to output demonstrates a process of standardization and formatting of geographical location data associated with various educational institutions. The primary goal is to present the location information in a consistent and universally understandable format, facilitating easier recognition and reference. This process underscores the importance of uniform data presentation, especially when dealing with a diverse set of entries that may initially follow different conventions for naming and geographical identification. The output makes no changes to the names of the institutions themselves but focuses solely on harmonizing the format of their locations., and input as ['UC Berkeley', 'Berkeley, CA'] output is Berkeley, CA, USA, input as ['University of Pennsylvania', 'Phialdelphia, PA, USA'] output is Phialdelphia, PA, USA, input as ['Cornell University', 'Ithaca, New York, USA'] output is Ithaca, NY, USA, input as ['Penn', 'Philadelphia, PA, USA'] output is Philadelphia, PA, USA, input as ['University of Michigan', 'Ann Arbor, MI, USA'] output is Ann Arbor, MI, USA, input as ['UC Berkeley', 'Berkeley, CA'] output is Berkeley, CA, USA, input as ['MIT', 'Cambridge, MA'] output is Cambridge, MA, USA, input as ['University of Pennsylvania', 'Phialdelphia, PA, USA'] output is Phialdelphia, PA, USA, input as ['UCLA', 'Los Angeles, CA'] output is Los Angeles, CA, USA, input as ['University of Maryland College Park', 'College Park, MD'] output is College Park, MD, USA, input as ['University of Michigan', 'Ann Arbor, MI, USA'] output is Ann Arbor, MI, USA, input as ['UC Berkeley', 'Berkeley, CA'] output is Berkeley, CA, USA, input as ['MIT', 'Cambridge, MA'] output is Cambridge, MA, USA, input as ['Rice University', 'Houston, TX'] output is Houston, TX, USA, input as ['Yale University', 'New Haven, CT, USA'] output is New Haven, CT, USA, input as ['Columbia University', 'New York, NY, USA'] output is New York, NY, USA, input as ['NYU', 'New York, New York, USA'] output is New York, NY, USA, input as ['Drexel University', 'Philadelphia, PA'] output is Philadelphia, PA, USA, input as ['UC Berkeley', 'Berkeley, CA'] output is Berkeley, CA, USA, input as ['UIUC', 'Urbana, IL'] output is Urbana, IL, USA, input as ['Temple University', 'Philadelphia, PA'] output is Philadelphia, PA, USA, input as ['Harvard University', 'Cambridge, MA, USA'] output is Cambridge, MA, USA, input as ['University of Connecticut', 'Storrs, CT, USA'] output is Storrs, CT, USA, input as ['Drexel University', 'Philadelphia, PA'] output is Philadelphia, PA, USA, input as ['NYU', 'New York, New York, USA'] output is New York, NY, USA, input as ['UIUC', 'Urbana, IL'] output is Urbana, IL, USA, input as ['New Haven University', 'New Haven, CT, USA'] output is New Haven, CT, USA, input as ['University of California, Santa Barbara', 'Santa Barbara, CA, USA'] output is Santa Barbara, CA, USA, input as ['University of Connecticut', 'Storrs, CT, USA'] output is Storrs, CT, USA, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
