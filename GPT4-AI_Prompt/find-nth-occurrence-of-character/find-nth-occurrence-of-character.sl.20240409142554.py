Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Input Column 1 Summary:
The first input column contains a string that describes an action involving replies to a list of individuals. The format of the string is consistent across the examples, indicating a structured action of replying to multiple users. The users are identified by their usernames, which are prefixed with an underscore. The string format is "replies to _username1, _username2, and _username3", suggesting a communication or interaction with three specific users. This column represents a qualitative description of an interaction pattern, specifically focusing on the act of replying to messages or comments from a set group of individuals.

### Input Column 2 Summary:
The second input column contains numerical strings that seem to represent a factor or a level of some sort, given as '1', '2', and '3'. These numbers are qualitative in nature within this context, as they likely signify different conditions or categories rather than quantitative measures. The progression from '1' to '3' suggests an ordinal relationship, where the value could be influencing the outcome in a systematic way. This column categorizes the instances into distinct groups based on this numerical identifier, which appears to play a role in determining the output.

### Output Column Summary:
The output column contains numerical values (12, 18, and 33) that are directly influenced by the inputs. These numbers increase as the value in the second input column increases, indicating a positive relationship between the numerical identifier in the second input column and the output value. The output values are quantitative, representing a measurable outcome or result that is derived from the interaction described in the first input column and categorized by the second input column.

### Relationship Summary:
The relationship between the input columns and the output column suggests that the action of replying to a specific set of individuals (_aya, _tasisuke, and _chan) combined with a categorizing factor (represented by '1', '2', and '3') influences the numerical outcome in a systematic way. As the categorizing factor increases, the output value also increases, indicating that the factor might represent an intensity level, volume of interaction, or another modifier that amplifies the result. The exact nature of how the inputs are transformed into the output is not specified, but there is a clear pattern that as the categorizing factor increases, so does the outcome, suggesting a direct relationship between the level of interaction or engagement and the resulting numerical value., and input as ['replies to _aya, _tasisuke, and _chan', '1'] output is 12, input as ['replies to _aya, _tasisuke, and _chan', '2'] output is 18, input as ['replies to _aya, _tasisuke, and _chan', '3'] output is 33, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.

def generated_function(action, level):
    """
    This function takes in two parameters: an action involving replies to a list of individuals,
    and a level represented by a numerical string. It returns a numerical value based on the
    combination of these inputs.
    
    Parameters:
    - action (str): A string describing the action, in the format "replies to _username1, _username2, and _username3".
    - level (str): A numerical string ('1', '2', or '3') representing a categorizing factor.
    
    Returns:
    - int: A numerical value that is influenced by the inputs.
