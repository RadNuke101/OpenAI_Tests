Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Input Column Summary:

The input data consists of two distinct parts:

1. **Textual Description**: The first part of the input is a consistent textual description that reads "replies to _aya, _tasisuke, and _chan". This phrase suggests a scenario where responses are being made to three entities or individuals identified by the names or identifiers _aya, _tasisuke, and _chan. The use of "replies to" indicates an action of responding or reacting to these entities.

2. **Numerical Identifier**: The second part of the input is a numerical identifier that varies across the dataset. This number appears to represent a variable or a parameter that could be influencing the outcome or the output. The numbers observed in the dataset are '1', '2', and '3', indicating a sequential or ordinal nature, possibly denoting levels, stages, or a count of some sort.

### Output Column Summary:

The output data is numerical and shows a significant variation in response to the different numerical identifiers in the input data. The observed outputs are 12, 18, and 33, corresponding to the numerical identifiers '1', '2', and '3', respectively. This variation suggests a direct relationship between the numerical identifier in the input and the numerical output, where the output increases as the numerical identifier increases. However, the rate of increase is not constant, indicating a non-linear relationship.

### Relationship Summary:

The relationship between the input and output data can be summarized as follows:

- The textual part of the input remains constant across the dataset, implying that the variation in output is not directly influenced by this component.
- The numerical identifier in the input appears to be the driving factor influencing the output values. As the numerical identifier increases, the output also increases, suggesting a positive correlation between these two elements.
- The relationship between the numerical identifier and the output is non-linear, as indicated by the varying increments in the output values (from '1' to '2', the output increases by 6, and from '2' to '3', it increases by 15).
- This relationship might imply a scenario where the number of replies or the complexity of replies increases with the numerical identifier, leading to a greater output value. The non-linear increase could suggest that as the scenario progresses (as denoted by the increasing numerical identifier), the effort, resources, or impact of the replies grows at an increasing rate.

In summary, the dataset suggests a scenario where responses to a fixed set of entities are quantified, with the quantification being significantly influenced by a numerical parameter, leading to a non-linearly increasing output., and input as ['replies to _aya, _tasisuke, and _chan', '1'] output is 12, input as ['replies to _aya, _tasisuke, and _chan', '2'] output is 18, input as ['replies to _aya, _tasisuke, and _chan', '3'] output is 33, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
