Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Input Column Summary:

The input data consists of two columns. The first column contains a string that mentions replies to three individuals, identified by their usernames prefixed with an underscore (_aya, _tasisuke, and _chan). This string remains constant across the dataset, indicating that the context of the interaction—replies to these three individuals—is a fixed parameter in this scenario. The second column is a numerical string that varies across the dataset, representing a sequence or perhaps a level of interaction, with values observed as '1', '2', and '3'. This suggests a progression or an increase in a certain variable related to the interaction with the mentioned individuals.

### Output Column Summary:

The output data is numerical, with values observed as 12, 18, and 33. These numbers increase as the second input column's numerical string increases from '1' to '3'. The output values do not increase linearly, indicating that the relationship between the level of interaction (as denoted by the second input column) and the output is not directly proportional or follows a simple arithmetic progression. Instead, the relationship might be more complex or could involve a non-linear formula that calculates the output based on the level of interaction.

### Relationship Summary:

The relationship between the input and output data suggests that the output is influenced by the level of interaction, as indicated by the numerical string in the second input column. As this level increases, the output also increases, but not in a straightforward or linear manner. This implies that the output could be a function of the interaction level, possibly compounded by additional factors not directly observable from the input data provided. The constant part of the input (mentions of replies to _aya, _tasisuke, and _chan) sets the context but does not seem to directly influence the variability in the output, as it remains unchanged across the dataset. The essence of this relationship indicates a complex interaction between the level of engagement or interaction (input) and the resulting output, which could be reflective of a scenario where responses or actions lead to outcomes that are not directly proportional to the input but are influenced by it in a more complex manner., and input as ['replies to _aya, _tasisuke, and _chan', '1'] output is 12, input as ['replies to _aya, _tasisuke, and _chan', '2'] output is 18, input as ['replies to _aya, _tasisuke, and _chan', '3'] output is 33, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
