Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Input Column Summary:

The input data consists of two columns, each containing information related to various universities in the United States. The first column lists the names of the universities, which include a mix of full university names (e.g., "University of Pennsylvania") and abbreviations or informal names (e.g., "UCLA" for University of California, Los Angeles, and "Penn" as a shorthand for the University of Pennsylvania). The second column provides the location of these universities, including the city and state. In some instances, the country ("USA") is also included, while in others, it is omitted. This variation suggests a lack of consistency in how location information is provided. The universities mentioned are spread across different states, indicating a geographical diversity in the data set.

### Output Column Summary:

The output data combines the information from the two input columns into a single string for each university, following the format "University Name, City, State, Country." When the country is not explicitly mentioned in the input, "USA" is added to the output, ensuring consistency in indicating that all these universities are located in the United States. This process standardizes the presentation of the university names and their locations, making it clear and uniform across all entries. The output effectively consolidates the information into a more readable and standardized format, which is beneficial for clarity and ease of understanding.

### Relationship Between Input and Output:

The transformation from the input to the output columns demonstrates a process of data standardization and enhancement. The key relationship is the enrichment of the location information by ensuring that the country ("USA") is always included in the output, even if it was missing in the input. This process not only makes the data more uniform but also eliminates any ambiguity regarding the country where these universities are located. Additionally, the output combines the separate pieces of information (university name and location) into a single, cohesive string for each entry, which simplifies data presentation and improves readability. This transformation indicates a careful consideration of data consistency and the utility of having a standardized format for representing university names and locations., and input as ['University of Pennsylvania', 'Phialdelphia, PA, USA'] output is University of Pennsylvania, Phialdelphia, PA, USA, input as ['UCLA', 'Los Angeles, CA'] output is UCLA, Los Angeles, CA, USA, input as ['Cornell University', 'Ithaca, New York, USA'] output is Cornell University, Ithaca, New York, USA, input as ['Penn', 'Philadelphia, PA, USA'] output is Penn, Philadelphia, PA, USA, input as ['University of Maryland College Park', 'College Park, MD'] output is University of Maryland College Park, College Park, MD, USA, input as ['University of Michigan', 'Ann Arbor, MI, USA'] output is University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
