Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Input Column Summary:

The input data consists of two distinct columns. The first column contains the names of various educational institutions, which include a mix of full university names and abbreviations (e.g., "University of Pennsylvania" and "UCLA"). These institutions are located in the United States and represent a diverse set of universities from different states. The second column provides the geographical location of these institutions, including the city and state. In some instances, the country "USA" is also included, while in others, it is omitted. This column highlights the specific locales of the universities, ranging from large cities like Los Angeles, CA, to smaller towns like Ithaca, New York.

### Output Column Summary:

The output data consolidates the information from the two input columns into a single string for each institution. It maintains the original format of the university names and geographical locations as provided in the input. However, it standardizes the inclusion of the country "USA" for all entries, ensuring that each output string ends with ", USA" if the country was not already specified in the input. This results in a uniform representation of the location for all the universities, regardless of whether the original input included the country. The output strings serve as a comprehensive identifier for each institution, combining both its name and its precise geographical location within the United States.

### Relationship Between Input and Output:

The transformation from input to output demonstrates a process of data standardization and consolidation. The relationship is characterized by the merging of two separate pieces of information (university name and location) into a single, coherent string that provides a complete identifier for each institution. This process involves appending the country "USA" to the location when it is not already specified, ensuring consistency across all entries. The output effectively captures the essence of the input data while enhancing its uniformity and clarity, making it more immediately useful for referencing the geographical context of each university. This transformation is particularly valuable for contexts where a standardized format for university names and locations is essential, such as in databases, directories, or comparative analyses., and input as ['University of Pennsylvania', 'Phialdelphia, PA, USA'] output is University of Pennsylvania, Phialdelphia, PA, USA, input as ['UCLA', 'Los Angeles, CA'] output is UCLA, Los Angeles, CA, USA, input as ['Cornell University', 'Ithaca, New York, USA'] output is Cornell University, Ithaca, New York, USA, input as ['Penn', 'Philadelphia, PA, USA'] output is Penn, Philadelphia, PA, USA, input as ['University of Maryland College Park', 'College Park, MD'] output is University of Maryland College Park, College Park, MD, USA, input as ['University of Michigan', 'Ann Arbor, MI, USA'] output is University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.

def generated_function(university_name, location):
    """
    This function takes the name of a university and its geographical location as inputs,
    and returns a single string combining both pieces of information. It ensures that the
    country "USA" is included in the output, even if it was omitted in the input.
    
    Parameters:
    university_name (str): The name of the university.
    location (str): The geographical location of the university.
