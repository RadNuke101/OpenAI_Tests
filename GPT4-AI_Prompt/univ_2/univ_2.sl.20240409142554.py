Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Input Column Summary:

The input data consists of two columns. The first column contains the names of various educational institutions, which include a mix of full university names and abbreviations (e.g., "University of Pennsylvania" and "UCLA"). These institutions are located in the United States and represent a diverse set of locations and prestige levels. The second column provides the geographical location of these institutions, including the city and state. In some instances, the country ("USA") is also included, while in others, it is omitted. This suggests a variability in the specificity and format of the location data provided.

### Output Column Summary:

The output data consolidates the information from the two input columns into a single string format, following the pattern: [Institution Name], [City, State, Country]. The output consistently includes the country ("USA") in the location, even if it was missing in the input data. This standardization process ensures that each entry has a uniform format, making it easier to understand the geographical context of each institution at a glance. The output reflects a direct transformation of the input data, enhancing its completeness and consistency regarding the geographical information.

### Relationship Summary:

The transformation from the input columns to the output column demonstrates a process of data standardization and enrichment. The primary relationship between the input and output is the integration of the institution's name with its geographical location into a single, coherent format. This process involves appending the country "USA" to the location information when it is not explicitly mentioned in the input, thereby standardizing the geographical data across all entries. The output provides a more complete and immediately useful representation of each institution's name and location, facilitating easier identification and comparison of the institutions based on their geographical context. This transformation is particularly valuable for contexts where consistent and comprehensive location information is required, such as academic research, educational directories, or geographic analyses of educational institutions., and input as ['University of Pennsylvania', 'Phialdelphia, PA, USA'] output is University of Pennsylvania, Phialdelphia, PA, USA, input as ['UCLA', 'Los Angeles, CA'] output is UCLA, Los Angeles, CA, USA, input as ['Cornell University', 'Ithaca, New York, USA'] output is Cornell University, Ithaca, New York, USA, input as ['Penn', 'Philadelphia, PA, USA'] output is Penn, Philadelphia, PA, USA, input as ['University of Maryland College Park', 'College Park, MD'] output is University of Maryland College Park, College Park, MD, USA, input as ['University of Michigan', 'Ann Arbor, MI, USA'] output is University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
