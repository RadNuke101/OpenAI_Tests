Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Summary for Input Column Data:

The input column data consists of pairs of qualitative descriptors and their corresponding numerical representations. Each pair is a combination of a cardinal number written in its word form (e.g., "one", "two", "three", "four") and its numeric form (e.g., "1", "2", "3", "4"). These pairs are presented in a sequence that follows the natural counting order, starting from "one" and at least up to "four". The input data represents a structured format where each entry is a textual and numerical representation of cardinal numbers. This structured pairing suggests a deliberate mapping of numbers to specific outputs, indicating a rule-based relationship between the input data and the corresponding outputs.

### Summary for Output Column Data:

The output column data consists of phrases that describe quantities of fruits, where each quantity directly corresponds to the cardinal number in the input data. The fruits mentioned are "apple", "banana", "strawberry", and "orange", each associated with the numbers one through four, respectively. The output phrases follow a consistent format: a cardinal number (in its word form from the input) followed by the name of a fruit in its plural form (except for "apple", which remains the same in both singular and plural). This indicates a systematic and predictable relationship between the input data and the types of fruits mentioned in the output.

### Relationship Summary:

The relationship between the input and output data is characterized by a rule-based mapping where each cardinal number (both in word and numeric form) is associated with a specific type of fruit and its corresponding quantity. The sequence of numbers is directly linked to a sequence of fruits, suggesting a predefined order or rule that determines the output based on the input. The input acts as a trigger or key for generating specific output phrases, where the cardinal number determines the quantity of the fruit mentioned, and the position of the number in the sequence determines the type of fruit. This structured relationship highlights a qualitative data processing mechanism where specific inputs are mapped to specific outputs based on defined rules, rather than quantitative calculations or transformations., and input as ['one, 1'] output is one apple, input as ['two, 2'] output is two bananas, input as ['three, 3'] output is three strawberries, input as ['four, 4'] output is four oranges, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
