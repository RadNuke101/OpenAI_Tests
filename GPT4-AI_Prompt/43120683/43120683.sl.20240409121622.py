Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Summary for Input Column Data:

The input data consists of pairs, each containing a textual representation of a number followed by its numeric form, separated by a comma. These pairs are as follows: 'one, 1', 'two, 2', 'three, 3', and 'four, 4'. Each pair represents a qualitative descriptor that corresponds to a specific quantity, ranging from one to four. The textual component provides a linguistic representation, while the numeric component offers a mathematical representation of the same quantity. This dual representation suggests a mapping mechanism where each unique pair is associated with a specific output in the form of a fruit.

### Summary for Output Column Data:

The output data consists of phrases that combine a numeric descriptor (in its textual form) with the name of a fruit. The outputs are as follows: 'one apple', 'two bananas', 'three strawberries', and 'four oranges'. Each output phrase corresponds directly to an input pair, with the numeric descriptor indicating the quantity and the fruit name providing a qualitative descriptor of the output. The sequence of fruits does not follow any apparent numerical or alphabetical order but is uniquely associated with the input pairs.

### Relationship Summary:

The relationship between the input and output data is a direct mapping from a pair of qualitative and quantitative descriptors to a specific fruit quantity and type. Each input pair, consisting of a word-number combination, is uniquely associated with an output that describes a quantity of a specific fruit. This mapping is consistent and predictable, with the first component (the textual number) of each input pair directly influencing the quantity mentioned in the output, and the implicit second component (the numeric value) seemingly influencing the choice of fruit, albeit through an unspecified rule. The relationship showcases a structured transformation where the input's qualitative and quantitative aspects are merged into a single, coherent output that describes a specific quantity of a particular fruit. This transformation suggests a rule-based system where each input pair is predetermined to result in a specific output, indicating a one-to-one correspondence between the input data and the output data., and input as ['one, 1'] output is one apple, input as ['two, 2'] output is two bananas, input as ['three, 3'] output is three strawberries, input as ['four, 4'] output is four oranges, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
