Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: To generate summaries for the given data, we'll first understand the nature of the data and then summarize the input and output columns accordingly. The data transformation process converts strings representing numbers in the input column to actual numeric values in the output column. Let's break down the summaries:

### Input Column Summary:
- **Nature of Data**: The input data consists of strings that represent numeric values. These strings are qualitative in nature, as they are initially treated as text rather than numbers.
- **Variability**: The input strings vary in length and composition but are composed exclusively of numeric characters (0-9). There are no decimal points, negative signs, or non-numeric characters present.
- **Data Type**: The data type for the input column is string. Each entry is enclosed in quotes, indicating that they are treated as text.
- **Examples**: Examples of input data include '101', '1002', and '743'. These examples show that the inputs can range from three to four characters in length, though the dataset might include strings of varying lengths.

### Output Column Summary:
- **Nature of Data**: The output data consists of integers. This transformation indicates a conversion process from qualitative (textual representation of numbers) to quantitative (actual numeric values).
- **Variability**: Similar to the input, the output values vary but correspond directly to the numeric interpretation of the input strings. The output retains the numeric value of the input string without any alterations like rounding or truncation.
- **Data Type**: The data type for the output column is integer. This conversion signifies a change from textual to numeric processing of the data.
- **Examples**: Examples of output data include 101, 1002, and 743, directly correlating to their respective inputs without any modifications.

### Relationship Summary:
- **Transformation Process**: The relationship between the input and output columns is a direct transformation from a qualitative to a quantitative representation of the same numeric values. This process involves parsing the input strings as integers to produce the output.
- **Consistency**: The transformation is consistent across the dataset, with each input string accurately converted to its numeric equivalent in the output.
- **Data Integrity**: The conversion process maintains the integrity of the numeric value, ensuring that the output precisely matches the numeric value represented by the input string.

In summary, the dataset involves a straightforward conversion of strings representing numbers (qualitative data) in the input column to their numeric equivalents (quantitative data) in the output column, maintaining a direct and consistent relationship between the two., and input as ['101'] output is 101, input as ['1002'] output is 1002, input as ['743'] output is 743, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
