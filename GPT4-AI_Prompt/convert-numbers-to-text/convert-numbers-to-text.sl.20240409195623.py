Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Input Column Summary:

The input data consists of a single column, where each row contains a string representation of a number. These strings do not have leading zeros and represent positive integers. The data is qualitative, meaning each entry is treated as a distinct category or label rather than a numerical value for computational purposes. The range of numbers represented as strings varies, indicating a diverse set of values within the input data. The input data is consistent in its format, with each entry being a valid string representation of an integer.

### Output Column Summary:

The output data is directly related to the input data, with each output being the integer representation of the corresponding input string. This transformation from string to integer is consistent across the dataset, indicating a direct and predictable relationship between the input and output. The output values retain the magnitude and significance of the input strings, now represented in a numerical format suitable for quantitative analysis. This conversion process does not alter the inherent value of the data but changes its representation from qualitative to quantitative.

### Relationship Summary:

The relationship between the input and output columns is a straightforward transformation from a qualitative to a quantitative representation of the same data. Each input string, which is qualitatively categorized based on its characters, is converted into its numerical equivalent in the output. This process highlights a direct mapping from the string format to an integer format, maintaining the original value while changing the data type. The transformation allows for the potential application of numerical analysis techniques on the output data, which was not applicable to the input data due to its qualitative nature. This conversion process is deterministic, with each unique input string corresponding to a unique output integer, ensuring a one-to-one relationship between the input and output datasets., and input as ['101'] output is 101, input as ['1002'] output is 1002, input as ['743'] output is 743, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
