Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Input Column Summary:

The input data consists of a single column containing strings that represent numerical values. Each string is composed of digits ('0'-'9') and does not contain any leading zeros, decimal points, or negative signs. The length of these strings varies, indicating that the numerical values they represent can range from very small to potentially very large numbers. The data is qualitative in nature, as it is initially treated as strings of text rather than numerical values. This qualitative treatment allows for the examination of patterns, such as the distribution of digit lengths or the frequency of certain digits, without immediately considering the mathematical value of the strings.

### Output Column Summary:

The output data is a direct numerical representation of the input strings. Each string from the input column is converted into an integer, effectively transitioning the data from a qualitative to a quantitative state. This conversion process maintains the integrity of the numerical value represented by each string, ensuring that the output is a faithful numerical representation of the input. The output, therefore, consists of integers that can vary widely in magnitude, directly correlating to the variation observed in the length and composition of the input strings.

### Relationship Summary:

The relationship between the input and output columns is characterized by a direct transformation process, where qualitative string representations of numbers are converted into their quantitative numerical equivalents. This transformation is consistent and deterministic, meaning that for any given input string, there is a predictable and specific output integer. The process does not alter the numerical value represented by the input string; it merely changes the data type from a string (qualitative) to an integer (quantitative).

This relationship highlights the versatility of data representation, showing how the same numerical value can be encoded in different formats for different purposes. In the context of this dataset, the transformation from input to output serves to bridge the gap between qualitative analysis (examining patterns and characteristics of the string data) and quantitative analysis (performing mathematical operations on the numerical values). The consistency and predictability of the transformation process ensure that the integrity of the data is maintained, allowing for accurate and meaningful analysis across both domains., and input as ['101'] output is 101, input as ['1002'] output is 1002, input as ['743'] output is 743, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
