Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: To generate a summary for the input column data and the output column based on the examples provided, we first need to understand the nature of the transformation from input to output and then describe the characteristics of both the input and output data. 

### Input Column Summary:
- **Nature of Data**: The input data is provided as a list of strings. Each string represents a sequence of digits, which can be interpreted as numbers when viewed as a whole.
- **Data Type**: Qualitative. Despite being composed of numerical digits, the input is treated as strings of text, not as numerical values.
- **Variability**: The examples show variability in the length of the strings, ranging from three to four characters. This suggests that the input data can vary in length and potentially in composition (though all examples are purely numerical).

### Output Column Summary:
- **Nature of Data**: The output data is numerical. Each output is a direct numerical representation of the input string.
- **Data Type**: Quantitative. Unlike the input, the output is treated as numerical data, indicating a transformation from a qualitative to a quantitative state.
- **Variability**: Similar to the input, the output varies in magnitude based on the input string. The output directly reflects the numerical value of the input string.

### Relationship Summary:
- **Transformation**: The process involves converting a string of digits (qualitative data) into its numerical equivalent (quantitative data). This transformation is direct and does not alter the sequence or value of the digits.
- **Preservation of Value**: The transformation preserves the value represented by the sequence of digits in the input. There is a one-to-one correspondence between the input string and the output number, meaning each unique input string results in a unique output number.
- **Data Type Conversion**: One of the key aspects of this relationship is the conversion of data types from strings (qualitative) to numerical values (quantitative). This conversion is essential for interpreting the input data in a mathematical or quantitative context.

In summary, the relationship between the input and output columns involves a direct conversion from a string representation of digits to their numerical equivalent, effectively transitioning from qualitative to quantitative data while preserving the original value represented by the input., and input as ['101'] output is 101, input as ['1002'] output is 1002, input as ['743'] output is 743, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
