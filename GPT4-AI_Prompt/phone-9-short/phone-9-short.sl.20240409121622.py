Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Summary of Input Column Data:

The input data consists of strings that represent phone numbers in a specific format. Each string begins with a '+' sign, followed by a country code of one to three digits. After the country code, there is a space, and then the rest of the phone number is divided into three groups by hyphens. Each group within the phone number varies in length but typically contains three to four digits. The format of the input data can be summarized as follows: "+[Country Code] [First Group]-[Second Group]-[Third Group]". The country codes and the groups of numbers vary across the dataset, indicating a diverse set of phone numbers from different regions.

### Summary of Output Column Data:

The output data transforms the format of the phone numbers provided in the input. The transformation involves removing the space and hyphens from the input format and replacing them with periods. The output maintains the country code and the sequence of numbers but changes the separators, resulting in a format that looks like "[Country Code].[First Group].[Second Group].[Third Group]". This transformation standardizes the phone numbers into a consistent format that is perhaps more universally readable or suitable for a specific application or database requirement.

### Relationship Between Input and Output:

The relationship between the input and output data is a systematic format transformation of phone numbers. The transformation rules are as follows:

1. **Preservation of Numeric Content**: All digits present in the input are retained in the output without alteration in their sequence or value.
2. **Change of Separators**: The space and hyphens used to separate the country code and the groups of numbers in the input are replaced with periods in the output. This indicates a standardization process for the phone number format.
3. **Consistency in Transformation**: The transformation applies uniformly across all data points, regardless of the length of the country code or the individual groups of numbers. This suggests an automated process designed to handle phone numbers of varying lengths and formats, converting them into a singular, standardized format.

In summary, the transformation from the input to the output format is a structured process aimed at standardizing phone numbers by altering their separators while preserving the original numeric information. This process could be part of data normalization efforts in a system that requires a consistent format for storing or processing phone numbers., and input as ['+106 769-858-438'] output is 106.769.858.438, input as ['+83 973-757-831'] output is 83.973.757.831, input as ['+62 647-787-775'] output is 62.647.787.775, input as ['+172 027-507-632'] output is 172.027.507.632, input as ['+72 001-050-856'] output is 72.001.050.856, input as ['+95 310-537-401'] output is 95.310.537.401, input as ['+6 775-969-238'] output is 6.775.969.238, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
