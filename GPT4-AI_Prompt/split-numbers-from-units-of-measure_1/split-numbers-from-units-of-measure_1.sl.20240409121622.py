Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Input Column Summary:

The input data consists of two columns. The first column contains strings that represent a numerical value followed by a non-numeric suffix. The suffix appears to denote a unit or type, such as 'v' for volts, 'hrs' for hours, 'h' for hour, and 'm' for meters, indicating a variety of measurements or categories. The numerical part of these strings varies, with examples including '80', '10', '7', and '500', suggesting a wide range of values. The second column contains numeric strings ('3', '3', '2', '4'), which might represent a category, type, or some form of identifier, but their specific purpose or meaning in relation to the first column or the output is not immediately clear from the provided data.

### Output Column Summary:

The output data is purely numeric, consisting of integers (80, 10, 7, 500) that directly correspond to the numerical part of the strings in the first column of the input data. This suggests that the output is derived by extracting the numeric component from the first column's strings, disregarding the non-numeric suffix and seemingly unrelated to the second column's values.

### Relationship Summary:

The relationship between the input and output data can be summarized as follows:

1. **Extraction of Numeric Value:** The process involves extracting the numeric part from the first column's mixed-format strings, effectively ignoring any alphabetic characters or symbols that follow the numeric value. This extraction results in the output, which is a pure numeric representation of the initial part of the input strings.

2. **Irrelevance of Suffix and Second Column:** The non-numeric suffix in the first column (indicating units or types) and the entirety of the second column do not influence the output. Their presence in the input data does not affect the numeric outcome, suggesting that the transformation from input to output focuses solely on the numeric component of the first column.

3. **Consistency Across Varied Inputs:** Despite the variety in the types of measurements or categories indicated by the suffixes in the first column (e.g., volts, hours, meters), and the differences in the second column's values, the method of deriving the output remains consistent. This indicates a uniform approach to handling diverse input data, focusing exclusively on numeric extraction.

In summary, the relationship between the input and output is characterized by the extraction of numeric values from a mixed-format string, with other elements in the input being disregarded for the purpose of generating the output. This suggests a qualitative to quantitative transformation where the qualitative descriptors (suffixes and second column values) are not factored into the quantitative output., and input as ['80v', '3'] output is 80, input as ['10hrs', '3'] output is 10, input as ['7h', '2'] output is 7, input as ['500m', '4'] output is 500, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
