Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Input Column Summary:

The input data consists of two columns. The first column contains strings that are a combination of numbers followed by alphabetic characters, representing some form of measurement or duration (e.g., '80v', '10hrs', '7h', '500m'). These strings seem to denote a quantity followed by a unit or identifier, where the unit could represent various dimensions such as voltage ('v'), hours ('hrs' or 'h'), or meters ('m'). The second column contains numeric strings, which appear to be unrelated to the first column's data in terms of content. The numbers in the second column are relatively small ('3', '3', '2', '4') and do not show a clear pattern or relationship with the first column based on the given examples.

### Output Column Summary:

The output data consists of a single column containing numeric values (80, 10, 7, 500). These numbers correspond to the numeric part of the strings in the first column of the input data, stripped of any alphabetic characters. The output values retain the magnitude of the quantities specified in the first input column but discard the unit or identifier part of the input.

### Relationship Summary:

The relationship between the input and the output data can be summarized as follows:

- The output is derived solely from the first column of the input data, with the second column of the input data having no apparent effect on the output.
- The process to obtain the output involves extracting the numeric part from the strings in the first input column, effectively removing any alphabetic characters that denote units or identifiers.
- The output retains the quantitative aspect of the first input column's data, presenting it as a pure number without any associated unit of measurement or identification.
- The transformation from input to output simplifies the data from a qualitative descriptor (a number with a unit) to a quantitative value (a number), focusing solely on the magnitude represented in the first input column.

This summary indicates that the operation applied to the input data to generate the output is a form of data cleaning or preprocessing, where the goal is to isolate numeric values from a mixed-format string for further analysis or processing that requires numeric input., and input as ['80v', '3'] output is 80, input as ['10hrs', '3'] output is 10, input as ['7h', '2'] output is 7, input as ['500m', '4'] output is 500, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
