Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Summary for Input Column Data:

The input data consists of strings that are a combination of numbers followed by alphabetic characters. These strings appear to represent measurements or quantities, with the numbers indicating the magnitude and the alphabetic characters possibly denoting units or types. The second part of the input is a single digit, which seems to be constant across the examples provided. The relationship between the first part of the input (the string with numbers and letters) and the second part (the single digit) is not explicitly clear from the data provided. However, the second part does not seem to directly influence the numerical part of the output, as it remains constant across different examples. The variety in the alphabetic suffixes ('v', 'hrs', 'h', 'm') suggests that the data could be from a context where different types of measurements or units are relevant, such as time ('hrs', 'h') or other unspecified units ('v', 'm').

### Summary for Output Column Data:

The output data is purely numerical, indicating that the process involves extracting or focusing on the numerical part of the first element of the input data. The output numbers correspond directly to the numerical portion of the first part of the input strings, regardless of the alphabetic characters that follow. This suggests that the operation applied to the input data effectively isolates and extracts the numerical component, discarding the alphabetic suffixes and seemingly ignoring the second part of the input (the single digit).

### Relationship Summary:

The relationship between the input and output data can be summarized as a process of numerical extraction. The operation applied to the input data extracts the numerical portion from the first element of the input, disregarding any alphabetic characters that follow these numbers as well as the second element of the input (the single digit). This process transforms qualitative descriptions or measurements into purely quantitative data, focusing solely on the magnitude part of the measurements without consideration for their units or types. The consistent presence of a second input element (the single digit) across examples without any apparent effect on the output suggests that its role might be unrelated to the numerical extraction process, or it might serve a purpose not discernible from the provided data alone., and input as ['80v', '3'] output is 80, input as ['10hrs', '3'] output is 10, input as ['7h', '2'] output is 7, input as ['500m', '4'] output is 500, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
