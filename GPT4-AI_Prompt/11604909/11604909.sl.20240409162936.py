Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Input Column Summary:

The input column consists of strings that represent various operating systems along with their version numbers and, in some cases, additional details such as build numbers or specific configurations. These operating systems span across different families, including UNIX (AIX), virtualization platforms (VMware ESX Server), Linux distributions, enterprise solutions (Red Hat Enterprise), Microsoft Windows versions, and their server editions. The strings vary in format, containing a mix of the operating system name, version numbers, build information, and sometimes special characters or additional descriptors (e.g., "<R>", "<2.6-78.0.13.ELlargesmp>"). This diversity in format indicates a need for parsing and extracting relevant information (version numbers) amidst a variety of textual contexts.

### Output Column Summary:

The output column contains the extracted version numbers from the input strings, focusing on the major and minor version components (e.g., "5.1", "3.5", "2.6", "1.0", "6.1"). These outputs are simplified representations of the operating system versions, omitting build numbers, patch levels, or any additional descriptors. The extraction process appears to prioritize the first occurrence of a version pattern within the input string, aiming to capture the most relevant version information that identifies the operating system's release.

### Relationship Between Input and Output:

The relationship between the input and output columns is defined by the process of extracting and simplifying version information from complex operating system identifiers. The key operation involves identifying and isolating the major and minor version numbers from a diverse set of input formats. This process demonstrates a pattern recognition task where the goal is to find and extract numerical patterns that fit the conventional representation of version numbers (major.minor format) amidst a variety of textual contexts.

The transformation from input to output involves:
- Parsing the input string to identify version numbers, which may be embedded within text, surrounded by special characters, or followed by additional details.
- Extracting the major and minor version components while discarding build numbers, patch levels, and any non-numeric descriptors.
- Simplifying the representation of the operating system version to facilitate a clear and concise identification of the software's release.

This relationship underscores the importance of accurately interpreting and simplifying complex software identifiers to obtain essential version information, which is crucial for tasks such as software management, compatibility checks, and security assessments., and input as ['AIX 5.1'] output is 5.1, input as ['VMware ESX Server 3.5.0 build-110268'] output is 3.5, input as ['Linux Linux 2.6 Linux'] output is 2.6, input as ['Red Hat Enterprise AS 4 <2.6-78.0.13.ELlargesmp>'] output is 2.6, input as ['Microsoft <R> Windows <R> 2000 Advanced Server 1.0'] output is 1.0, input as ['Microsoft Windows XP Win2008R2 6.1.7601'] output is 6.1, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
