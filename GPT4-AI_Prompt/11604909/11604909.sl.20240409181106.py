Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Input Column Summary:

The input data consists of strings that describe various operating systems along with their versions and, in some cases, additional details such as build numbers or specific configurations. These strings vary significantly in format, including different naming conventions, versioning schemes, and the inclusion of extra identifiers or descriptions (e.g., build numbers, edition names, or hardware compatibility notes). The operating systems represented in the input data span a range of types, including Unix-like systems (e.g., AIX, Linux), virtualization platforms (e.g., VMware ESX Server), and Windows operating systems. The diversity in the input data reflects the broad spectrum of operating system versions and configurations that can exist in computing environments.

### Output Column Summary:

The output data consists of simplified version numbers extracted from the more complex input strings. These version numbers are presented in a more standardized format, typically including only the major and minor version components (e.g., "5.1", "3.5", "2.6", "1.0", "6.1"). The output data distills the essential versioning information from the input, omitting additional details such as build numbers, edition names, or specific configurations. This simplification process results in a more uniform set of version numbers that can be more easily compared or analyzed.

### Relationship Between Input and Output:

The relationship between the input and output data involves the extraction and simplification of version numbers from complex operating system descriptions. The process identifies and isolates the core versioning information (major and minor versions) from the input strings, which may contain a variety of additional details and formatting complexities. This extraction highlights the essential versioning information while discarding less critical details, resulting in a streamlined and more consistent set of version numbers in the output.

The transformation from input to output demonstrates the ability to parse and interpret varied textual data formats, extracting key pieces of information according to specific criteria (in this case, operating system version numbers). This process is valuable in contexts where a clear understanding of the versioning of software or systems is necessary, such as in compatibility assessments, software development, or IT inventory management. The summary of the relationship underscores the importance of being able to distill critical information from diverse and complex data sources., and input as ['AIX 5.1'] output is 5.1, input as ['VMware ESX Server 3.5.0 build-110268'] output is 3.5, input as ['Linux Linux 2.6 Linux'] output is 2.6, input as ['Red Hat Enterprise AS 4 <2.6-78.0.13.ELlargesmp>'] output is 2.6, input as ['Microsoft <R> Windows <R> 2000 Advanced Server 1.0'] output is 1.0, input as ['Microsoft Windows XP Win2008R2 6.1.7601'] output is 6.1, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
