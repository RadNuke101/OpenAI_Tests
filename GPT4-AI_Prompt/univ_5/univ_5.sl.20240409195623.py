Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Input Column Summary:

The input data consists of two columns, with each row representing a specific university or college and its corresponding location. The first column includes the names of various prestigious universities across the United States, such as the University of Pennsylvania, UCLA, Cornell University, and others. These names are sometimes presented in their full form (e.g., "University of Pennsylvania") and other times in a more colloquial or abbreviated form (e.g., "Penn" for the University of Pennsylvania or "NYU" for New York University). 

The second column provides the geographical location of each institution. These locations are given with varying levels of detail, from city and state (e.g., "Los Angeles, CA") to more comprehensive formats that include the country (e.g., "Ithaca, New York, USA"). Notably, there are inconsistencies in the representation of state names, with some entries using full state names (e.g., "New York") and others using state abbreviations (e.g., "NY").

### Output Column Summary:

The output data standardizes the format of the geographical locations associated with each university or college mentioned in the input. Each output entry is structured to include the city, the state abbreviation, and the country ("USA"), ensuring a consistent and concise format across all entries. This standardization addresses the inconsistencies observed in the input data, such as varying levels of detail and the use of full state names versus abbreviations. The output effectively normalizes the location information, making it more uniform and easier to understand at a glance.

### Relationship Between Input and Output:

The transformation from input to output demonstrates a process of standardization and normalization of geographical location data associated with various higher education institutions in the United States. The output retains all critical location information from the input while ensuring that each entry adheres to a consistent format. This process involves correcting minor spelling errors (e.g., "Phialdelphia" to "Philadelphia"), standardizing state names to their abbreviations, and appending the country name "USA" where it was not originally included. The relationship between the input and output underscores the importance of data consistency, especially when dealing with qualitative information that may be presented in various formats. This standardization facilitates easier comparison, analysis, and understanding of the geographical distribution of these institutions., and input as ['University of Pennsylvania', 'Phialdelphia, PA, USA'] output is Phialdelphia, PA, USA, input as ['UCLA', 'Los Angeles, CA'] output is Los Angeles, CA, USA, input as ['Cornell University', 'Ithaca, New York, USA'] output is Ithaca, NY, USA, input as ['Penn', 'Philadelphia, PA, USA'] output is Philadelphia, PA, USA, input as ['University of Maryland College Park', 'College Park, MD'] output is College Park, MD, USA, input as ['University of Michigan', 'Ann Arbor, MI, USA'] output is Ann Arbor, MI, USA, input as ['Columbia University', 'New York, NY, USA'] output is New York, NY, USA, input as ['NYU', 'New York, New York, USA'] output is New York, NY, USA, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
