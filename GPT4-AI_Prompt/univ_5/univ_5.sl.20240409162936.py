Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Summary of Input Column Data:

The input data consists of two columns, each containing information related to various universities and their locations in the United States. The first column provides the names of the universities, which include a mix of full university names (e.g., "University of Pennsylvania", "Cornell University", "University of Maryland College Park", "University of Michigan", "Columbia University") and abbreviations or informal names (e.g., "UCLA" for University of California, Los Angeles, and "Penn" for the University of Pennsylvania). This variety indicates a broad representation of institutions, ranging from Ivy League universities to large public research universities.

The second column in the input data specifies the geographical locations of these universities. These locations are presented with varying levels of detail, from city and state (e.g., "Los Angeles, CA") to more complete addresses that include the country (e.g., "Philadelphia, PA, USA"). Some entries use the full name of the state (e.g., "New York, New York, USA"), while others use the state's two-letter abbreviation (e.g., "Ann Arbor, MI, USA"). This variation in the presentation of locations suggests a non-standardized input format.

### Summary of Output Column Data:

The output data standardizes the format of the university locations provided in the input. Each output entry includes the city, the state abbreviation, and the country ("USA"), ensuring a consistent and concise format across all entries. This standardization addresses the variations observed in the input data, such as the correction of spelling errors (e.g., "Phialdelphia" to "Philadelphia"), the abbreviation of state names (e.g., "New York" to "NY"), and the addition of missing country information for entries that initially lacked it. The output format provides a clear and uniform way to represent the locations of the universities, making the data easier to understand and use for further analysis or mapping.

### Relationship Between Input and Output:

The transformation from input to output data involves cleaning, standardizing, and sometimes correcting the geographical location information associated with each university. The process ensures that all locations are represented in a uniform format, which includes the city name, state abbreviation, and the country "USA". This standardization is crucial for enhancing the readability and usability of the data, especially in contexts where consistent formatting is necessary, such as databases, geographic information systems (GIS), or when conducting comparative analyses across different institutions. The relationship between the input and output highlights the importance of data cleaning and standardization in data processing and analysis tasks., and input as ['University of Pennsylvania', 'Phialdelphia, PA, USA'] output is Phialdelphia, PA, USA, input as ['UCLA', 'Los Angeles, CA'] output is Los Angeles, CA, USA, input as ['Cornell University', 'Ithaca, New York, USA'] output is Ithaca, NY, USA, input as ['Penn', 'Philadelphia, PA, USA'] output is Philadelphia, PA, USA, input as ['University of Maryland College Park', 'College Park, MD'] output is College Park, MD, USA, input as ['University of Michigan', 'Ann Arbor, MI, USA'] output is Ann Arbor, MI, USA, input as ['Columbia University', 'New York, NY, USA'] output is New York, NY, USA, input as ['NYU', 'New York, New York, USA'] output is New York, NY, USA, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
