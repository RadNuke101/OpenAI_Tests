Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Summary for Input Column Data:

The input data consists of two columns, each representing different types of information related to various universities in the United States. The first column contains the names of the universities, which include a mix of full university names (e.g., "University of Pennsylvania", "Cornell University") and abbreviations or informal names (e.g., "UCLA", "Penn"). This variety indicates that the dataset includes both formal and colloquial ways of referring to these institutions.

The second column provides the location of each university, including the city and state. In some cases, the country ("USA") is also included, while in others, it is omitted. The state names are sometimes fully spelled out (e.g., "New York"), and other times they are abbreviated (e.g., "NY"). This suggests a lack of consistency in how location data is presented.

### Summary for Output Column Data:

The output data standardizes the format of the university locations provided in the input. It consistently includes the city, the state abbreviation, and the country ("USA"), regardless of how the location was originally presented. This standardization process involves correcting spelling errors (e.g., "Phialdelphia" to "Philadelphia"), abbreviating state names if they were originally spelled out, and adding "USA" to the end of each location if it was not already present. The output ensures a uniform presentation of the location information for each university.

### Relationship Between Input and Output:

The transformation from input to output demonstrates a process of standardization and correction of the university location data. The primary goal appears to be achieving a consistent format that includes the city, state abbreviation, and country for each university's location. This process involves correcting typographical errors, standardizing state names to their abbreviations, and ensuring the country is explicitly mentioned. The relationship between the input and output highlights an effort to clean and unify location data for ease of understanding and analysis, making it more accessible and useful for various applications, such as database management or geographic analysis., and input as ['University of Pennsylvania', 'Phialdelphia, PA, USA'] output is Phialdelphia, PA, USA, input as ['UCLA', 'Los Angeles, CA'] output is Los Angeles, CA, USA, input as ['Cornell University', 'Ithaca, New York, USA'] output is Ithaca, NY, USA, input as ['Penn', 'Philadelphia, PA, USA'] output is Philadelphia, PA, USA, input as ['University of Maryland College Park', 'College Park, MD'] output is College Park, MD, USA, input as ['University of Michigan', 'Ann Arbor, MI, USA'] output is Ann Arbor, MI, USA, input as ['Columbia University', 'New York, NY, USA'] output is New York, NY, USA, input as ['NYU', 'New York, New York, USA'] output is New York, NY, USA, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
