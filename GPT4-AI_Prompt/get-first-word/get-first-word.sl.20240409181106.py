Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Summary for Input Column Data:

The input data consists of phrases or sentences of varying lengths, starting from a complete sentence to a single word. These inputs appear to be fragments of a sentence, progressively truncated from the beginning. The initial input starts with a full sentence, "The quick brown fox.", and subsequent inputs are shortened versions of this sentence, with the leading words removed. This pattern suggests a systematic reduction in the length of the input text, focusing on different segments of the original sentence.

### Summary for Output Column Data:

The output data corresponds to the first word of the respective input data, except for the case when the input is a single word. In cases where the input is a complete sentence or a phrase, the output extracts the initial word of that input. However, when the input is reduced to a single word, the output is an empty string. This indicates a process that identifies and extracts the leading word from a phrase or sentence but does not apply when the input is already a single word.

### Relationship Between Input and Output:

The relationship between the input and output data is characterized by the extraction of the leading word from the input text. The process seems to follow a rule where the first word of any given input sentence or phrase is identified and presented as the output. This rule is consistently applied across different lengths of input texts, from complete sentences to phrases. However, an exception to this rule occurs when the input is a single word, resulting in an empty string as output. This suggests that the extraction process is designed to operate on inputs consisting of multiple words and does not consider single-word inputs as valid for extraction. The systematic reduction in input text length and the corresponding outputs highlight a focused examination on how the initial word of an input is identified and isolated, demonstrating a clear, rule-based relationship between the input and output data., and input as ['The quick brown fox.'] output is The, input as ['quick brown fox.'] output is quick, input as ['fox'] output is , , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
