Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Input Column Summary:

The input data consists of fragments of a sentence, specifically the phrase "The quick brown fox." These fragments vary in length and content, starting from the complete phrase to progressively shorter segments, with each subsequent input missing the first word of the preceding input. The inputs represent a sequential trimming of the sentence, focusing on different parts of the original phrase. This qualitative data is textual and showcases a process of reduction, where each entry is a truncated version of the one before it, highlighting a specific sequence of words within the original sentence.

### Output Column Summary:

The output data directly correlates with the input data but follows a pattern of omission. For each input, the output is the first word of the corresponding input text. This pattern continues until the input is a single word, at which point the output becomes an empty string. The outputs represent a systematic extraction of the leading word from the given input phrases, showcasing a consistent method of data transformation from the input to the output.

### Relationship Summary:

The relationship between the input and output columns is characterized by a rule-based extraction process. Specifically, the output is generated by isolating and presenting the first word of each input text. This relationship demonstrates a clear, deterministic process where the output is directly dependent on the structure and content of the input. As the input undergoes a reduction, losing its initial word with each step, the output adjusts accordingly, always reflecting the current first word of the input until the input is reduced to a single word, at which point the output yields an empty string. This showcases a linear, predictable transformation from input to output, governed by the principle of initial word extraction from the given text fragments., and input as ['The quick brown fox.'] output is The, input as ['quick brown fox.'] output is quick, input as ['fox'] output is , , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
