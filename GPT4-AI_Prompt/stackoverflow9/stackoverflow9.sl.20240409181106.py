Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Input Column Summary:

The input column consists of full names of individuals, each entry formatted as a single string. These names appear to follow a conventional Western naming format, typically including a first name, a middle name, and a last name, although the number of names present can vary. The data is qualitative, representing personal identifiers rather than numerical values. Each entry is unique, reflecting the diversity of names within a given population. The structure of the data suggests a focus on individuals' names in a format that might be commonly found in formal documents or databases.

### Output Column Summary:

The output column contains the last names extracted from the full names provided in the input column. Each output is a single word, representing the surname of the individual named in the corresponding input entry. This column simplifies the qualitative data from the input by isolating a specific component of each name, which is the last name. The transformation from input to output demonstrates a consistent pattern of extracting the final element from the structured input data, assuming the last word in each input string is the surname.

### Relationship Between Input and Output:

The relationship between the input and output columns is characterized by a process of extraction and simplification. The output is derived by isolating the last word from each full name in the input column, under the assumption that this last word represents the individual's surname. This process reflects a common practice in data management where specific elements of a dataset are extracted for focused analysis or for simplification purposes. The transformation from a full name to just a surname reduces the complexity of the data, making it more suitable for tasks that require identification based on last names alone, such as sorting, indexing, or cross-referencing with other datasets where individuals are identified by their surnames. This relationship underscores a methodical approach to data handling, where qualitative data is refined to meet specific informational needs or to align with standardized data formats., and input as ['Sarah Jane Jones'] output is Jones, input as ['Bob Jane Smithfield'] output is Smithfield, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
