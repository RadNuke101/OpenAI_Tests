Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Summary for Input Column Data:

The input data represents a series of strings that describe various vehicle maintenance or monitoring components, each followed by a unique alphanumeric identifier. These strings are composed of three main parts: a component descriptor (e.g., "Tire Pressure", "Oil Life", "Air conditioner"), a unique identifier (e.g., "ABC123873", "ABC849999999021", "GHF211"), and sometimes a type of device or action associated with the component (e.g., "Monitor", "gauge", "maintenance"). The component descriptor provides context about what aspect of the vehicle is being referred to, while the unique identifier is a specific code or serial number associated with that component. The additional descriptor (when present) gives further detail about the nature of the component or the action being taken or recommended.

### Summary for Output Column Data:

The output data consists of the unique alphanumeric identifiers extracted from the input strings. These identifiers serve as a key or reference code that uniquely distinguishes each component or item mentioned in the input. The output isolates these identifiers from the broader context provided in the input, focusing solely on the unique codes.

### Relationship Summary between Input and Output:

The relationship between the input and output data is characterized by the extraction process, where the output is a specific subset of information drawn from the input. The input provides a descriptive context, combining both qualitative (descriptive text about vehicle components or actions) and quantitative (unique alphanumeric codes) elements. The output, however, isolates and presents only the quantitative elementâ€”the unique identifiers. This extraction process highlights the importance of these identifiers in tracking, referencing, or possibly diagnosing issues related to the specific vehicle components mentioned. The output serves as a distilled form of the input, removing descriptive context to focus on the unique codes that likely serve operational, tracking, or diagnostic purposes within a broader system of vehicle maintenance or monitoring., and input as ['Tire Pressure ABC123873 Monitor'] output is ABC123873, input as [' Oil Life ABC849999999021 gauge'] output is ABC849999999021, input as [' Air conditioner GHF211 maintenance'] output is GHF211, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
