Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Summary for Input Column Data:

The input data consists of strings that describe various vehicle maintenance or monitoring components, each followed by a unique alphanumeric identifier. These strings typically start with the name of the vehicle component or system being referred to, such as "Tire Pressure," "Oil Life," or "Air conditioner." This is followed by the unique identifier, which appears to be a mix of letters and numbers. The identifiers are embedded within the strings and are not consistently positioned at the start or end but are always preceded by a descriptive component name. The descriptions and identifiers are part of a larger phrase that might include additional words such as "Monitor," "gauge," or "maintenance," which provide context about the nature of the service or component related to the identifier.

### Summary for Output Column Data:

The output data consists of the unique alphanumeric identifiers extracted from the input strings. These identifiers, such as "ABC123873," "ABC849999999021," and "GHF211," are crucial for distinguishing between different vehicle maintenance components or monitoring systems. The output data is clean, focused solely on these identifiers, and stripped of any additional context or descriptive text found in the input data. This streamlined output allows for a clear and concise reference to specific vehicle components or services without the surrounding descriptive language.

### Relationship Between Input and Output:

The relationship between the input and output data is a process of extracting specific, unique identifiers from longer descriptive strings related to vehicle maintenance and monitoring. The input data provides a context-rich description that includes both the nature of the vehicle component or system and its associated unique identifier. The process involves identifying and isolating these unique identifiers from the broader descriptive context. The output, therefore, represents a distilled form of the input, focusing solely on the unique identifiers that are essential for distinguishing between different components or services. This extraction process is crucial for applications that require quick reference or categorization of vehicle-related components or services based on their unique identifiers, removing the need to parse through descriptive text to find this information., and input as ['Tire Pressure ABC123873 Monitor'] output is ABC123873, input as [' Oil Life ABC849999999021 gauge'] output is ABC849999999021, input as [' Air conditioner GHF211 maintenance'] output is GHF211, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
