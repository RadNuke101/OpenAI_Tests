Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Input Column Summary:

The input column consists of qualitative data entries that represent distances in miles. Each entry is a string that includes a numerical part followed by the word "miles". The numerical part varies across entries, indicating different distances. The format is consistent across all entries, maintaining a structure where the numerical distance is always followed by the word "miles". This consistency in format suggests a standardized way of representing distances, making it easier to identify and extract the numerical distance values if needed. The data, while presented in a qualitative format, inherently contains quantitative information about distances.

### Output Column Summary:

The output column consists of quantitative data extracted from the input column. Each entry in the output column is a numerical representation of the distance mentioned in the corresponding input entry. The transformation from input to output involves extracting the numerical part of the input string and presenting it as an integer. This process strips away the qualitative descriptor ("miles") and retains the quantitative essence of the data, converting it into a purely numerical form that can be used for further quantitative analysis or calculations.

### Relationship Summary:

The relationship between the input and output columns is a process of data transformation from a qualitative to a quantitative representation of the same information. The input data, while qualitative in nature due to its string format, contains quantitative information about distances. The output data is the result of extracting this quantitative information, specifically the numerical distance values, from the qualitative input strings. This transformation process involves identifying and isolating the numerical part of each input string and converting it into an integer for the output. The consistent format of the input data facilitates this extraction process, allowing for a straightforward conversion from a qualitative description of distance to a quantitative measurement. This relationship highlights a method of data processing where qualitative data containing embedded quantitative information is converted into a purely quantitative format for ease of analysis and application in various contexts., and input as ['736 miles'] output is 736, input as ['1255 miles'] output is 1255, input as ['1221 miles'] output is 1221, input as ['790 miles'] output is 790, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
