Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Input Column Summary:

The input data consists of strings that represent distances in miles. Each entry in the column is structured as a numerical value followed by the word "miles." The data is qualitative in nature, as it represents a description of distance. The numerical part of each entry varies, indicating different distances. The format is consistent across all entries, suggesting a standardized way of reporting distances.

### Output Column Summary:

The output data extracts the numerical part of the input data, representing it as an integer. This transformation from a qualitative description to a quantitative value allows for numerical operations and analysis. The output retains the essence of the input data (the distance) but discards the unit of measurement (miles) in its representation. This simplification suggests a focus on the magnitude of distances rather than their qualitative description.

### Relationship Summary:

The relationship between the input and output data is a process of extraction and simplification. For each input entry, the process identifies and extracts the numerical value that represents the distance, converting it from a string to an integer. This transformation discards the qualitative descriptor ("miles") and retains the quantitative essence (the numerical value of the distance).

This relationship indicates a structured approach to data processing where the goal is to simplify qualitative descriptions into quantitative values that can be easily analyzed or processed further. The consistent format of the input data suggests that this process relies on a predictable structure to accurately extract the numerical values. The transformation from qualitative to quantitative data facilitates a wide range of potential analyses, such as statistical calculations, comparisons, or aggregations, which would be more challenging with the original qualitative descriptions., and input as ['736 miles'] output is 736, input as ['1255 miles'] output is 1255, input as ['1221 miles'] output is 1221, input as ['790 miles'] output is 790, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
