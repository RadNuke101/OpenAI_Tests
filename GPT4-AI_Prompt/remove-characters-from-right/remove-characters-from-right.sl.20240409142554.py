Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Input Column Summary:

The input data consists of strings that represent distances in miles. Each string follows a consistent format, beginning with a numerical value that specifies the distance, followed by a space, and then the word "miles". The numerical values vary across the dataset, indicating different distances. The input data is qualitative in nature, as it represents distances in a textual format rather than purely numerical. However, the numerical part of each string can be extracted and treated as quantitative data for analysis or computation purposes.

### Output Column Summary:

The output data consists of numerical values that directly correspond to the distances mentioned in the input data. These values are integers and represent the same distances that are described in the input strings but without the qualitative descriptor "miles". The output data is quantitative, providing a clear, numeric representation of the distances that were qualitatively described in the input data.

### Relationship Summary:

The relationship between the input and output data is a direct transformation from a qualitative description of distance to a quantitative representation of the same distance. Specifically, the output is obtained by extracting the numerical part of the input string, effectively converting the qualitative distance description into a quantitative value. This transformation process discards the textual description ("miles") and retains only the numeric value that represents the distance. The consistency in the format of the input data allows for a straightforward extraction of the numeric value, ensuring that the output accurately reflects the distance described in the input, albeit in a different format. This relationship highlights a method of converting qualitative data into a quantitative form, which can be particularly useful for computational analyses or when numerical precision is required., and input as ['736 miles'] output is 736, input as ['1255 miles'] output is 1255, input as ['1221 miles'] output is 1221, input as ['790 miles'] output is 790, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
