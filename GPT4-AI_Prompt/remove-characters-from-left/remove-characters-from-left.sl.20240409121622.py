Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Input Column Summary:

The input data consists of two columns. The first column contains strings that are a mix of digits and, in some cases, letters and special characters. These strings vary in length and composition, indicating a diverse set of alphanumeric identifiers or codes. Examples include '1234', '**512A', and '343DMX', showcasing a range of patterns that include purely numerical, mixed alphanumeric with special characters at the beginning, and mixed alphanumeric with letters at the end.

The second column contains single-digit numbers, such as '1', '2', and '3'. These numbers appear to represent a positional parameter or a directive that influences how the data from the first column is processed or interpreted.

### Output Column Summary:

The output data is derived from the first column of the input, modified according to the directive given by the second column of the input. The transformation results in substrings of the original input strings, with the starting point or the amount of data removed based on the numerical value provided in the second column. For instance, outputs like '234', '512A', and 'DMX' suggest that the process involves removing a certain number of characters from the start of the input string, determined by the value in the second column. The output retains the character composition of the original input, including digits, letters, and, where applicable, special characters, but with a reduced length.

### Relationship Summary:

The relationship between the input and output columns is characterized by a transformation process where the second column's value directly influences the modification of the strings in the first column. Specifically, the number in the second column dictates how many characters are to be removed from the beginning of the string in the first column. The output is essentially a substring of the original input, starting from a position that is one more than the value indicated in the second column (since the counting starts at 0). This process is consistent across the dataset, indicating a rule-based manipulation where the second column acts as a control parameter for slicing the first column's strings. The nature of the data and the transformation applied suggest a focus on data preprocessing or formatting, where specific parts of the identifiers or codes are extracted based on a given criterion., and input as ['1234', '1'] output is 234, input as ['**512A', '2'] output is 512A, input as ['343DMX', '3'] output is DMX, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.

    This function takes an input string and a directive to remove a certain number of characters

    - directive (str): A single-digit number as a string, indicating how many characters to remove from the start of the input_string.
