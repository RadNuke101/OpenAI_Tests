Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Input Column Summary:

The input data consists of two columns. The first column contains strings that are a mix of digits and, in some cases, letters and special characters. These strings vary in length and composition, indicating a diverse set of alphanumeric sequences. Examples include '1234', '**512A', and '343DMX', showcasing a mix of purely numerical, mixed alphanumeric with special characters at the beginning, and mixed alphanumeric sequences, respectively.

The second column contains single-digit numbers represented as strings, such as '1', '2', and '3'. These numbers suggest a parameter or an operation to be applied to the strings in the first column.

### Output Column Summary:

The output data consists of a single column that contains the results of applying a certain operation, as indicated by the second input column, to the strings in the first input column. The operation modifies the original strings, resulting in outputs like '234', '512A', and 'DMX'. These outputs retain the character composition of the original strings but are shorter in length, indicating that part of the original string has been removed or altered based on the operation defined by the second input column.

### Relationship Summary:

The relationship between the input and output columns can be summarized as a transformation process where the second input column dictates the nature of the operation to be applied to the strings in the first input column. This operation appears to involve removing a certain number of characters from the original string, where the number of characters to be removed is determined by the value in the second input column.

For example, given an input of ['1234', '1'], the output is '234', indicating that one character from the start of the original string ('1234') has been removed. Similarly, for ['**512A', '2'], the output is '512A', suggesting that the first two characters have been removed from the original string. This pattern is consistent across the examples, demonstrating a clear relationship where the second column's value directly influences the transformation applied to the first column's string, resulting in the output.

In summary, the transformation process is a character removal operation from the beginning of the string in the first input column, with the extent of removal dictated by the numerical value provided in the second input column. This process retains the original character composition of the strings beyond the removed section, leading to the observed outputs., and input as ['1234', '1'] output is 234, input as ['**512A', '2'] output is 512A, input as ['343DMX', '3'] output is DMX, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
