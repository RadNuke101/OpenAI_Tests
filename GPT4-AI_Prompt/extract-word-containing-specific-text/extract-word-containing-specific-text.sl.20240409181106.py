Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Summary for Input Column Data:

The input data consists of textual commands or requests that involve actions related to communication, specifically through email or contact for support. These commands are directed towards specific entities identified by their unique email or website addresses. The structure of these commands typically follows a pattern where an action (e.g., "send email" or "contact") is specified, followed by the target entity's address. The addresses are embedded within the text and are crucial for the action to be executed. The input data is qualitative, representing various scenarios where a user might want to initiate communication with a specific entity for reasons such as support, inquiries, or information exchange.

### Summary for Output Column Data:

The output data extracts and isolates the unique email or website addresses from the input commands. These addresses serve as the key information needed to fulfill the requested actions. The output is qualitative and consists solely of these addresses, stripped of any additional context or action verbs present in the input. This simplification highlights the focus on identifying and extracting the target entities for communication, which are central to the user's request.

### Relationship Summary Between Input and Output:

The relationship between the input and output data is characterized by a process of extraction and simplification. The input data contains detailed commands or requests that include specific actions to be taken towards an entity identified by an email or website address. The output data, on the other hand, distills this information down to just the essential email or website addresses, removing all other contextual information. This transformation indicates a clear focus on identifying the target of the communication request as the most critical piece of information. The process effectively filters out the actionable part of the input (e.g., "send email to", "contact") and isolates the direct object of these actions (the email or website addresses), which are necessary for any subsequent steps or processes aimed at fulfilling the user's request., and input as ['send email to json_acme.com'] output is json_acme.com, input as ['contact help_robot.com for all support requests'] output is help_robot.com, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
