Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Summary for Input Column Data:

The input data consists of textual instructions or commands that involve actions related to communication or support requests. These instructions are directed towards specific entities, identifiable by their unique identifiers, which are typically in the format of email addresses or domain names. The instructions are varied in their phrasing but share a common goal of initiating contact or requesting assistance from the specified entities. The language used is imperative, suggesting that the actions are to be executed by the recipient of these instructions. The entities to be contacted are embedded within these instructions, indicating that the primary purpose of the input data is to identify and extract these specific targets for communication or support.

### Summary for Output Column Data:

The output data is a streamlined extraction from the input data, focusing solely on the identification of the entities intended for communication or support. These entities are represented by their unique identifiers, which are either email addresses or domain names. The output simplifies the input by removing all instructional or contextual information, leaving only the essential identifiers that are the target of the actions described in the input. This distilled information is crucial for any subsequent processes or actions that need to be taken regarding these entities.

### Summary Describing the Relationship Between Input and Output:

The relationship between the input and output data is characterized by a process of extraction and simplification. The input data provides a context-rich instruction that includes both the action to be taken and the target entity for that action. The output data, on the other hand, distills this information to its most essential component: the unique identifier of the target entity. This process highlights the importance of identifying the key entities within a broader instructional context, enabling focused action or communication with those entities. The transformation from input to output represents a filtering process where the primary goal is to isolate and present the critical information needed for further action, demonstrating a clear linkage between the directive nature of the input and the specific, actionable focus of the output., and input as ['send email to json_acme.com'] output is json_acme.com, input as ['contact help_robot.com for all support requests'] output is help_robot.com, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
