Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Summary for Input Column Data:

The input data consists of textual instructions or commands that involve actions related to communication or support services. These instructions are directed towards specific entities identified by their unique identifiers, which are in the format of email addresses or domain names. The instructions are varied in their phrasing but share a common theme of initiating contact or requesting assistance. The entities to be contacted are embedded within these instructions, indicating that the primary action involves reaching out to or interacting with these specified entities for various purposes such as sending emails or seeking support.

### Summary for Output Column Data:

The output data extracts and isolates the unique identifiers (email addresses or domain names) from the input instructions. These identifiers represent the specific targets or recipients of the actions mentioned in the input data. The output simplifies the input by focusing solely on these entities, stripping away the surrounding instructional text. This distilled information highlights the key focus of each instruction, which is the entity to be contacted or interacted with.

### Relationship Between Input and Output:

The relationship between the input and output data is a process of extraction and simplification. The input data provides a context-rich instruction that includes an action to be taken and the target of that action, embedded within a more complex sentence structure. The output data, on the other hand, distills this information to its essence by extracting the target entity's identifier, removing the instructional context. This process transforms a directive or request into a clear and concise reference to the entity involved. The output serves as a direct link or reference point to the intended recipient or subject of the input action, facilitating a focused and streamlined approach to fulfilling the instruction's intent., and input as ['send email to json_acme.com'] output is json_acme.com, input as ['contact help_robot.com for all support requests'] output is help_robot.com, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
