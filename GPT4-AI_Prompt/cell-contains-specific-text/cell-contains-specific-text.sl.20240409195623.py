Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Input Column Summary:

The input data consists of two columns. The first column contains phrases or sentences, which are well-known English idioms or common sayings. These phrases are complete in themselves and convey a specific meaning or advice through their usage. Examples include "An apple a day keeps the doctor away" and "Better the devil you know." These sayings are part of the cultural lexicon and are often used to impart wisdom or advice in a concise manner.

The second column contains single words or short phrases, which are essentially keywords or segments extracted from the broader context or entirely different words. Examples from the data include "apple," "orange," and "you know." These keywords or phrases are meant to be checked against the corresponding phrases in the first column to determine a specific relationship or condition.

### Output Column Summary:

The output data is binary, represented by boolean values true or false. The output signifies whether the keyword or phrase from the second input column is found within the corresponding phrase or saying in the first input column. A true value indicates the presence of the keyword or phrase within the saying, suggesting a direct textual or semantic relationship. Conversely, a false value denotes the absence of the keyword or phrase within the saying, indicating no direct textual relationship between the given keyword and the saying.

### Relationship Summary:

The relationship between the input and output columns is based on the presence or absence of the keywords or phrases (from the second input column) within the sayings or phrases (from the first input column). The process involves a straightforward textual or semantic analysis where each keyword or phrase is searched within the corresponding saying. If the keyword or phrase is found within the saying, the relationship is affirmed with a true output, indicating a direct textual link. If the keyword or phrase is not found within the saying, the relationship is negated with a false output, indicating no direct textual connection.

This relationship showcases a simple yet effective method of textual analysis, focusing on keyword or phrase identification within larger text bodies. It reflects the basic principles of content analysis, where specific elements within a text are identified and analyzed to understand their presence, frequency, or absence, thereby deriving meaningful insights or conclusions from the textual data., and input as ['An apple a day keeps the doctor away', 'apple'] output is true, input as ['An apple a day keeps the doctor away', 'orange'] output is false, input as ['Better the devil you know', 'you know'] output is true, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
