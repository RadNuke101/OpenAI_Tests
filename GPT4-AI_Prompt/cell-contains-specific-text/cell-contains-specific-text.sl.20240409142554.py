Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Input Column 1 Summary: Phrases or Sentences
The first input column consists of a series of phrases or sentences. These are complete thoughts or statements, often representing common sayings or expressions in the English language. Each entry is a standalone piece of text that conveys a specific idea or advice, reflecting a mix of wisdom, observations, or general statements about life, behavior, or outcomes.

### Input Column 2 Summary: Keywords or Phrases
The second input column contains keywords or phrases that are to be searched for within the sentences or phrases provided in the first column. These keywords or phrases may represent a single word or a combination of words. The purpose of these inputs is to identify whether these specific elements are present within the larger text provided in the first column.

### Output Column Summary: Boolean Values (True or False)
The output column consists of Boolean values: True or False. These values indicate the presence or absence of the second input (the keyword or phrase) within the first input (the sentence or phrase). A True value signifies that the keyword or phrase from the second input column is found within the text of the first input column. Conversely, a False value indicates that the keyword or phrase is not present in the text.

### Relationship Summary
The relationship between the input columns and the output column is a straightforward search and match operation. The process involves examining the text provided in the first input column for the presence of the keyword or phrase specified in the second input column. If the keyword or phrase is found within the text, the relationship yields a True output, indicating a successful match. If the keyword or phrase is not found within the text, the output is False, indicating no match. This relationship showcases a basic text analysis operation, focusing on the detection of specific elements within a larger body of text. The operation is binary, with the outcome being either a presence (True) or absence (False) scenario, based on the criteria specified in the second input column., and input as ['An apple a day keeps the doctor away', 'apple'] output is true, input as ['An apple a day keeps the doctor away', 'orange'] output is false, input as ['Better the devil you know', 'you know'] output is true, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.

def generated_function(sentence, keyword):
    # Check if the keyword is present in the sentence
    return keyword in sentence

# Test cases based on the given examples

# The function will return True or False based on the presence of the keyword in the sentence.
print(generated_function("An apple a day keeps the doctor away", "apple"))  ## Output: true
print(generated_function("An apple a day keeps the doctor away", "orange"))  ## Output: false
print(generated_function("Better the devil you know", "you know"))  ## Output: true
