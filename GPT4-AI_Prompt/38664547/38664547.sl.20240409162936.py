Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Input Column Summary:

The input data consists of single-word strings that appear to be combinations of smaller words or prefixes with more substantial words. These combinations often start with the word "that" or contain the word "that" within them, except for one outlier, "mouse," which does not follow this pattern. The presence of "that" in most inputs suggests a pattern where the input strings are constructed by appending or prepending "that" to another word, except in cases where the input does not follow this construct, as seen with "mouse."

### Output Column Summary:

The output data extracts specific words from the input strings, focusing on the word that follows "that" or, in the absence of "that," the entire word itself. The process seems to isolate meaningful words from the concatenated inputs, effectively removing the "that" prefix when it is present. In cases where "that" is not part of the input, the output remains unchanged from the input, indicating a consistent rule of either removing "that" to reveal the word it prefixes or maintaining the original word if "that" is not a component.

### Relationship Summary:

The relationship between the input and output columns demonstrates a simple transformation rule: when the input string contains "that" as a prefix or within the word, the output is the word following "that." This process effectively strips away the "that" component, leaving behind what appears to be the more significant part of the compound word. In cases where "that" is not present, the output directly mirrors the input, indicating no change. This transformation suggests a focus on isolating specific words from a compound structure or maintaining standalone words as they are, highlighting a method of extracting or maintaining key terms from a given set of input data., and input as ['thatensures'] output is ensures, input as ['thatwill'] output is will, input as ['thathave'] output is have, input as ['knowthat'] output is know, input as ['that'] output is that, input as ['mouse'] output is mouse, input as ['knowthat'] output is know, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
