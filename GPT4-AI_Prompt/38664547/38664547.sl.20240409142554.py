Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Summary of Input Column Data:

The input data consists of single-word strings that appear to be combinations of smaller words or standalone words. These strings can be categorized into two main types: 

1. **Compound Words**: These are combinations of two smaller words where one of the words is "that." Examples include 'thatensures', 'thatwill', 'thathave', and 'knowthat'. These compound words suggest a relationship or action associated with "that" or an understanding as in "knowthat."

2. **Standalone Words**: These are words that do not contain any apparent smaller components within the given dataset. Examples include 'that' and 'mouse'. These words do not follow the compound structure observed in the other examples and serve as independent entities.

The input data, therefore, represents a mix of compound and standalone words, with a significant portion involving the word "that" either as a prefix or as part of a compound structure. This suggests a focus on actions or states related to "that" or concepts that can be linked to knowledge or understanding, alongside the inclusion of completely unrelated standalone words.

### Summary of Output Column Data:

The output data consists of single words that appear to be the extracted components or the essence of the input words. The outputs are:

- For compound words involving "that," the output is the word following "that" (e.g., 'ensures', 'will', 'have'). This suggests a process of extracting the action or state associated with "that."
- For the compound word 'knowthat', the output is 'know', indicating a focus on the action or concept preceding "that."
- For standalone words like 'that' and 'mouse', the output is identical to the input, suggesting that when there's no compound structure to extract from, the word remains unchanged.

### Relationship Summary:

The relationship between the input and output data suggests a rule-based extraction process focused on the semantic components of compound words and the preservation of standalone words. When the input is a compound word involving "that," the process extracts the word immediately following "that" to capture the action or state related to "that." When "that" follows another concept (as in 'knowthat'), the process extracts the preceding concept, focusing on the knowledge or understanding aspect. For standalone words, the output remains unchanged, indicating a default behavior in the absence of a compound structure to dissect. This relationship highlights a methodical approach to distilling the essence or focal point of the input words, emphasizing actions, states, and concepts while maintaining standalone entities as they are., and input as ['thatensures'] output is ensures, input as ['thatwill'] output is will, input as ['thathave'] output is have, input as ['knowthat'] output is know, input as ['that'] output is that, input as ['mouse'] output is mouse, input as ['knowthat'] output is know, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
