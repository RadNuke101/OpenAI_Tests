Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Summary of Input Column Data:

The input data consists of strings that follow a structured format, which includes a timestamp, a phone number, and a message. Each entry begins with a date in the format "Dec 2, 2014," followed by a time stamp that includes hours and minutes (e.g., "11=23 PM"). After the timestamp, there is a separator ("-") and then a phone number that is prefixed with a country code (e.g., "+91 90000 80000"). Following the phone number, there is an equal sign ("=") that precedes the actual message content (e.g., "loren ipsum"). The structure is consistent across entries, indicating a standardized format for logging or recording messages with their respective timestamps and sender information.

### Summary of Output Column Data:

The output data extracts and isolates the message content from the input data, disregarding the timestamp, phone number, and any structural characters (e.g., "=", "-"). The output is the pure textual content of the message, which can vary in length and content but is consistently stripped of any metadata or formatting present in the input. This results in a clean, readable text that focuses solely on the message conveyed, without any additional context or information about the sender or the time the message was sent.

### Relationship Between Input and Output:

The relationship between the input and output data is a process of extraction and simplification, where the output is derived by isolating a specific portion of the input data. The input data provides a comprehensive record that includes not only the message content but also metadata such as the time the message was sent and the sender's phone number. The output, however, focuses exclusively on the message content, removing all extraneous information and formatting. This transformation highlights the importance of the message itself within the dataset, suggesting that the primary interest or utility lies in analyzing or utilizing the textual content of the messages, rather than their metadata. The process effectively separates the qualitative content of the messages from the quantitative or structured context in which they were sent, allowing for focused analysis or display of the message content alone., and input as ['Dec 2, 2014, 11=23 PM - +91 90000 80000= loren ipsum'] output is loren ipsum, input as ['Dec 2, 2014, 11=24 PM - +91 90000 80000= loren'] output is loren, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
