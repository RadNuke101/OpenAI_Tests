Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Summary of Input Column Data:

The input data consists of two columns, each containing specific information related to various universities and their locations in the United States. The first column provides the names of the universities, which include a mix of full university names (e.g., "University of Pennsylvania") and abbreviations or informal names (e.g., "UCLA", "Penn", "NYU"). This variety indicates a broad representation of institutions, from those with global recognition to those known more colloquially or regionally.

The second column in the input data specifies the geographical locations of these universities, presented in a format that typically includes the city, state abbreviation, and sometimes the country (USA). However, there is inconsistency in the representation of state names (full name vs. abbreviation) and the inclusion of the country. Some entries provide a complete address format ("Philadelphia, PA, USA"), while others omit the country ("Los Angeles, CA") or use full state names ("Ithaca, New York, USA").

### Summary of Output Column Data:

The output data standardizes the geographical location format from the input data, ensuring consistency across all entries. It appears to follow a uniform structure: city name, state abbreviation, and the country ("USA"), even when the original input did not include the country. Additionally, where the state was initially mentioned in full, it has been abbreviated to ensure uniformity (e.g., "New York" becomes "NY"). This standardization process simplifies the geographical information, making it more concise and easier to understand at a glance.

### Relationship Between Input and Output:

The transformation from input to output data demonstrates a process of standardization and simplification of university locations in the United States. The primary goal seems to be achieving a consistent format for representing these locations, focusing on city, state abbreviation, and the inclusion of the country ("USA") for clarity, especially in cases where it was initially omitted. This process disregards variations in university naming conventions (full names vs. abbreviations) and addresses inconsistencies in the representation of geographical locations. The output data thus provides a streamlined and uniform way of identifying the locations of various universities, enhancing readability and comparability across entries., and input as ['University of Pennsylvania', 'Phialdelphia, PA, USA'] output is Phialdelphia, PA, USA, input as ['UCLA', 'Los Angeles, CA'] output is Los Angeles, CA, USA, input as ['Cornell University', 'Ithaca, New York, USA'] output is Ithaca, NY, USA, input as ['Penn', 'Philadelphia, PA, USA'] output is Philadelphia, PA, USA, input as ['University of Maryland College Park', 'College Park, MD'] output is College Park, MD, USA, input as ['University of Michigan', 'Ann Arbor, MI, USA'] output is Ann Arbor, MI, USA, input as ['Columbia University', 'New York, NY, USA'] output is New York, NY, USA, input as ['NYU', 'New York, New York, USA'] output is New York, NY, USA, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
