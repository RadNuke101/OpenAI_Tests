Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Summary for Input Column Data:

The input data consists of two primary columns, each containing specific information related to various universities and their locations within the United States. The first column lists the names of the universities, which include a mix of full university names (e.g., "University of Pennsylvania," "Cornell University") and abbreviations or informal names (e.g., "UCLA," "Penn," "NYU"). This variety indicates that the dataset includes both formal and colloquial references to these institutions.

The second column provides the geographical locations associated with each university. These locations are given in a city, state format, with some entries including the country ("USA") and others omitting it. Additionally, there is a variation in the state notation, with some entries using full state names (e.g., "New York") and others using state abbreviations (e.g., "NY"). This column's data points to a focus on American universities, given the presence of "USA" in several entries and the specificity of city and state information.

### Summary for Output Column Data:

The output data standardizes the format of the geographical locations associated with the universities mentioned in the input data. Each entry in the output column follows a consistent "City, State Abbreviation, USA" format, regardless of how the input data was presented. This standardization process includes correcting spelling errors (e.g., "Phialdelphia" to "Philadelphia"), converting full state names to their respective abbreviations (e.g., "New York" to "NY"), and appending ", USA" to entries that previously omitted the country. The output data ensures a uniform representation of locations, facilitating easier identification and comparison of the universities' geographical settings.

### Relationship Between Input and Output:

The transformation from input to output data demonstrates a process of standardization and correction of the geographical information associated with various universities in the United States. The relationship between the input and output columns highlights an effort to create a consistent and error-free representation of university locations, making the data more accessible and interpretable. This process involves correcting typographical errors, standardizing state notations, and ensuring the inclusion of the country for international clarity. The output effectively homogenizes the format of the location data, which could be particularly useful for applications requiring geographical sorting, filtering, or mapping of these institutions., and input as ['University of Pennsylvania', 'Phialdelphia, PA, USA'] output is Phialdelphia, PA, USA, input as ['UCLA', 'Los Angeles, CA'] output is Los Angeles, CA, USA, input as ['Cornell University', 'Ithaca, New York, USA'] output is Ithaca, NY, USA, input as ['Penn', 'Philadelphia, PA, USA'] output is Philadelphia, PA, USA, input as ['University of Maryland College Park', 'College Park, MD'] output is College Park, MD, USA, input as ['University of Michigan', 'Ann Arbor, MI, USA'] output is Ann Arbor, MI, USA, input as ['Columbia University', 'New York, NY, USA'] output is New York, NY, USA, input as ['NYU', 'New York, New York, USA'] output is New York, NY, USA, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
