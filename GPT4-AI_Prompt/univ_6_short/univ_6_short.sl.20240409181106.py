Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Summary of Input Column Data:

The input data consists of two columns, with each row representing a specific university or college and its associated location. The first column contains the names of various higher education institutions, including a mix of full university names (e.g., "University of Pennsylvania", "Cornell University") and abbreviations or informal names (e.g., "UCLA", "Penn", "NYU"). These institutions are located across different states in the USA, indicating a geographical diversity in the dataset.

The second column provides the location of each institution, presented in varying formats. Some entries include the city and state abbreviation (e.g., "Los Angeles, CA"), while others add the country ("USA") or use full state names instead of abbreviations. There are also instances of misspellings (e.g., "Phialdelphia" instead of "Philadelphia") and variations in the representation of state names (e.g., "New York, New York" vs. "New York, NY").

### Summary of Output Column Data:

The output data standardizes the format of the location information provided in the second input column. Each output entry consists of the city, state abbreviation, and the country ("USA"), ensuring consistency across all entries. This standardization process corrects misspellings (e.g., "Phialdelphia" to "Philadelphia"), uses state abbreviations consistently (e.g., "New York" to "NY"), and adds the country "USA" where it was missing, providing a uniform representation of the locations.

### Relationship Between Input and Output:

The transformation from input to output demonstrates a process of standardization and correction of the location data associated with various universities and colleges in the USA. The output ensures that each location is represented in a consistent format, facilitating easier comparison and analysis. This process involves correcting spelling errors, standardizing the representation of state names to their abbreviations, and ensuring the inclusion of the country "USA" in all entries. The relationship between the input and output highlights the importance of data cleaning and standardization in enhancing the usability and interpretability of qualitative data sets., and input as ['University of Pennsylvania', 'Phialdelphia, PA, USA'] output is Phialdelphia, PA, USA, input as ['UCLA', 'Los Angeles, CA'] output is Los Angeles, CA, USA, input as ['Cornell University', 'Ithaca, New York, USA'] output is Ithaca, NY, USA, input as ['Penn', 'Philadelphia, PA, USA'] output is Philadelphia, PA, USA, input as ['University of Maryland College Park', 'College Park, MD'] output is College Park, MD, USA, input as ['University of Michigan', 'Ann Arbor, MI, USA'] output is Ann Arbor, MI, USA, input as ['Columbia University', 'New York, NY, USA'] output is New York, NY, USA, input as ['NYU', 'New York, New York, USA'] output is New York, NY, USA, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
