Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Input Column Summary:

The input data consists of strings that appear to be a mix of alphanumeric codes, abbreviations, and potentially meaningful words or phrases. These strings are complex and seem to follow no strict format, containing a variety of elements such as:

- Sequences of numbers, often separated by dashes (e.g., "2283-332-44543").
- Capitalized words that could represent codes, abbreviations, or specific identifiers (e.g., "CAP", "DDT", "PPL445").
- A mix of uppercase and lowercase words that might carry specific meanings or instructions (e.g., "HEEN PAX 77820").
- Special characters, notably underscores, which might signify a separation or a specific notation within the data (e.g., "PPSSA223_").

The data appears to be structured in a way that combines these elements without a clear, consistent pattern across the examples provided. This suggests that the input data could be coming from a system or database where various types of information are concatenated into single strings for processing or identification purposes.

### Output Column Summary:

The output data extracted from the input strings is significantly simpler and more uniform. It consists of phrases that are more coherent and potentially meaningful compared to the varied and complex nature of the input data. The outputs are characterized by:

- Being shorter and more concise.
- Containing words that are more likely to represent meaningful information or instructions (e.g., "HEEN PAX 77820").
- Including numbers that could be identifiers or codes relevant to the context of the output (e.g., "77820", "1550").
- Maintaining a mix of uppercase letters and numbers, but with a clearer structure or purpose.

### Relationship Summary:

The relationship between the input and output data suggests a process of extracting specific, meaningful information from a larger, more complex set of data. The input strings contain a wealth of information that is likely relevant in a broader context but requires parsing or filtering to isolate the parts of interest. The output, on the other hand, represents a distilled version of this dataâ€”focusing on elements that are presumably of primary importance for the task or context at hand.

This extraction process seems to target specific patterns or keywords within the input data, possibly looking for segments that follow a certain format or contain certain keywords (e.g., "PAX", "BOX") and then isolating these segments along with any immediately relevant information (such as identifiers or codes). The presence of special characters like underscores in the input might serve as markers or delimiters to aid in this extraction process.

In summary, the transformation from input to output represents a filtering or parsing operation designed to reduce complex strings into simpler, more meaningful information by identifying and extracting relevant segments based on certain criteria or patterns., and input as ['2283-332-44543 CAP DDT PPL445_ HEEN PAX 77820'] output is HEEN PAX 77820, input as ['44372-33-3223 TYYTE CAP BOX 1550 244 BOX PPSSA223_ PAX'] output is PAX, input as ['PRECISE 77 CLEAR BLUE 99WIE_ BOX 4403 PAX SSKA'] output is BOX 4403 PAX SSKA, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
