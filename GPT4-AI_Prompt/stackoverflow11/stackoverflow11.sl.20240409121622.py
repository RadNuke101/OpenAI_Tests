Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Input Column Summary:

The input data appears to be a string of alphanumeric characters and words, possibly representing codes, names, or identifiers, followed by a mixture of uppercase letters, numbers, and special characters such as hyphens and underscores. The structure of the input data is not uniform, containing a varied combination of elements including potential codes (e.g., '2283-332-44543'), acronyms or abbreviations (e.g., 'CAP', 'DDT'), and possibly names or identifiers that follow these codes and acronyms. The presence of underscores towards the end of each string suggests a delimiter or a marker indicating a transition to a different type of data or a significant element within the string.

### Output Column Summary:

The output data extracted from each input string is a sequence of words and numbers that seem to follow the underscore character in the input data. These outputs are more structured and coherent compared to the input, often resembling names, identifiers, or short phrases with potential numerical values attached (e.g., 'HEEN PAX 77820'). The output data lacks the complexity and randomness of the input, focusing instead on what appears to be key information extracted from the latter part of the input strings.

### Relationship Between Input and Output:

The relationship between the input and output data suggests a process of extracting specific, meaningful information from a larger, more complex string of data. The key to this extraction seems to be the underscore character, which acts as a delimiter or marker indicating the start of the relevant data to be outputted. The output is consistently the portion of the input that follows this underscore, suggesting a rule-based extraction process focused on retrieving a coherent and potentially significant piece of information from a mixed and less structured input.

This extraction process simplifies the complex and varied input into a more understandable and potentially useful output, filtering out the noise and focusing on what appears to be essential data. The nature of the output, often resembling names with or without numerical values, implies that the purpose of this process might be to isolate identifiers, names, or key phrases from a larger dataset for further use or analysis., and input as ['2283-332-44543 CAP DDT PPL445_ HEEN PAX 77820'] output is HEEN PAX 77820, input as ['44372-33-3223 TYYTE CAP BOX 1550 244 BOX PPSSA223_ PAX'] output is PAX, input as ['PRECISE 77 CLEAR BLUE 99WIE_ BOX 4403 PAX SSKA'] output is BOX 4403 PAX SSKA, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
