Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Input Column Summary:

The input data consists of strings that appear to be a mixture of alphanumeric codes, abbreviations, and potentially meaningful words or phrases. These strings are characterized by their lack of a consistent format, containing various elements such as numbers, uppercase letters, hyphens, and underscores. The presence of specific keywords or phrases seems to be embedded within a larger context of seemingly random or coded information. The data does not follow a clear, uniform structure, making it difficult to discern a straightforward pattern or rule that dictates its composition. However, certain elements like "CAP", "BOX", "PAX", and others, recur across different inputs, suggesting these might play a role in determining the output or have some significance in the context of the data.

### Output Column Summary:

The output data is significantly more structured and concise compared to the input data. Each output is a clean, readable string devoid of the alphanumeric codes and the randomness that characterizes the input. The outputs consist of meaningful words or phrases, potentially indicating a category, action, or specific information extracted or derived from the input. The presence of words like "PAX" and "BOX" in some outputs, which also appear in the input, suggests a direct relationship between certain keywords in the input and the resulting output. The outputs are free from the clutter of codes and seem to represent a distilled, relevant piece of information extracted from the complex input.

### Relationship Between Input and Output:

The relationship between the input and output data appears to be a process of extraction and simplification, where specific, meaningful information is identified and isolated from within a complex, coded string. The process seems to filter out alphanumeric codes, random sequences, and irrelevant data, focusing on extracting coherent phrases or keywords that have standalone significance. The presence of certain keywords in both the input and output suggests that these play a crucial role in determining what part of the input is relevant and should be retained in the output. The transformation from input to output involves removing noise and highlighting information that is presumably of interest or value, suggesting a targeted extraction based on certain rules or criteria that prioritize specific types of information over others. This relationship indicates a sophisticated understanding or processing capability that can discern relevant data points within a chaotic or unstructured input., and input as ['2283-332-44543 CAP DDT PPL445_ HEEN PAX 77820'] output is HEEN PAX 77820, input as ['44372-33-3223 TYYTE CAP BOX 1550 244 BOX PPSSA223_ PAX'] output is PAX, input as ['PRECISE 77 CLEAR BLUE 99WIE_ BOX 4403 PAX SSKA'] output is BOX 4403 PAX SSKA, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
