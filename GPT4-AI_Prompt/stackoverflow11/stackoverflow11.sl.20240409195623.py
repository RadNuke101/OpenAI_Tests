Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Input Column Summary:

The input data consists of strings that appear to be a mix of alphanumeric codes, abbreviations, and potentially meaningful words or phrases. Each string is a combination of numbers, uppercase letters, and special characters (such as hyphens and underscores). The structure of the input data is not uniform across examples, indicating variability in the format and content. Key observations include:

- **Alphanumeric Codes and Numbers**: Each input string contains sequences of numbers, sometimes separated by hyphens, which could represent codes, identifiers, or dates.
- **Abbreviations and Words**: The presence of uppercase abbreviations and words suggests categorization or specific terminology, possibly related to an industry or field (e.g., "CAP", "DDT", "PPL445").
- **Special Characters**: Hyphens and underscores are used, potentially as separators or to denote specific sections within the input data.
- **Variability in Length and Content**: The input data varies in length and the type of content it includes, indicating a lack of a strict format.

### Output Column Summary:

The output data extracted from the input strings appears to be more structured and consistent compared to the input. Key characteristics include:

- **Selective Extraction**: The output seems to selectively include certain parts of the input, focusing on specific words or phrases and potentially a sequence of numbers.
- **Preservation of Order**: The order in which words and numbers appear in the output corresponds to their order in the input, suggesting a rule-based extraction rather than random selection.
- **Exclusion of Codes and Abbreviations**: The output tends to exclude the alphanumeric codes, abbreviations, and special characters, focusing instead on more meaningful words or phrases and sometimes numbers.

### Relationship Between Input and Output:

The process of generating the output from the input data appears to involve identifying and extracting specific types of information while omitting others. The criteria for what is included in the output could be based on:

- **Semantic Meaning**: The output favors words and phrases that convey clear meaning over abstract codes or abbreviations.
- **Positional Rules**: There might be rules based on the position within the input string that determine what gets included in the output (e.g., extracting information following certain keywords or symbols).
- **Content Filtering**: The process likely involves filtering out certain types of content (e.g., codes, abbreviations) while retaining others (e.g., meaningful phrases, numbers).

In summary, the relationship between the input and output data suggests a structured approach to extracting meaningful information from a mix of codes, abbreviations, and phrases. The output focuses on preserving semantically meaningful content, potentially for further analysis or use in a specific context., and input as ['2283-332-44543 CAP DDT PPL445_ HEEN PAX 77820'] output is HEEN PAX 77820, input as ['44372-33-3223 TYYTE CAP BOX 1550 244 BOX PPSSA223_ PAX'] output is PAX, input as ['PRECISE 77 CLEAR BLUE 99WIE_ BOX 4403 PAX SSKA'] output is BOX 4403 PAX SSKA, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
