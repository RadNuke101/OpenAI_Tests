Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Input Column Summary:

The input data consists of full names, which are strings containing first names, middle names or initials, and last names. These names are presented in a variety of formats, including:

1. Single middle names or initials (e.g., 'susan ann chang', 'bobby t. smith').
2. No middle name or initial (e.g., 'ayako tanaka').
3. Multiple middle names or initials (e.g., 'anthory r. tom brown').

The names are diverse, representing different cultures or origins as indicated by the variety in the structure and phonetics of the names. The input data showcases a mix of gender-neutral, traditionally masculine, and traditionally feminine names, indicating a broad spectrum of individuals. The presence of initials, single, or multiple middle names suggests variability in how individuals choose to represent their names or how they are recorded in different contexts.

### Output Column Summary:

The output data extracts and presents the middle names or initials from the input names, with the following observations:

1. When there is a single middle name or initial, it is extracted as is (e.g., 'ann' from 'susan ann chang', 't.' from 'bobby t. smith').
2. If there is no middle name or initial, the output is empty (e.g., '' from 'ayako tanaka').
3. For names with multiple middle names or initials, all middle names or initials are extracted together (e.g., 'r. tom' from 'anthory r. tom brown').

The output specifically focuses on the middle segment(s) of the input names, disregarding the first and last names. This suggests a selective interest in the part of the name that might be considered optional or additional in many naming conventions.

### Relationship Summary:

The relationship between the input and output data is characterized by the extraction and isolation of middle names or initials from full names. The process appears to follow a set of rules based on the presence and number of middle names or initials within the input names. The extraction process respects the integrity of the middle names or initials, including maintaining the format (e.g., keeping initials with periods). This relationship highlights a focus on the part of a person's name that might carry specific cultural, familial, or personal significance, often used to distinguish between individuals with otherwise similar first and last names. The method of extraction does not alter the middle names or initials but presents them as standalone entities, separated from the broader context of the full name. This could suggest an interest in the unique identifiers within names that might be used for various analytical, organizational, or personal reasons., and input as ['susan ann chang'] output is ann, input as ['ayako tanaka'] output is , input as ['bobby t. smith'] output is t., input as ['anthory r. tom brown'] output is r. tom, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
