Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Summary of Input Column Data

The input data consists of strings formatted to represent international telephone numbers. Each string begins with a country code prefixed with a plus sign (+), followed by a space, and then the telephone number itself. The telephone number is further divided into three segments separated by hyphens (-). The first segment appears immediately after the country code and space, the second segment is in the middle, and the third segment is at the end. The country codes and the segments of the telephone numbers vary in length, indicating a diversity of formats depending on the country or region the number is from. The input data is qualitative, representing different instances of a structured textual format rather than numerical values to be calculated or aggregated.

### Summary of Output Column Data

The output data consists of the first segment of the telephone number extracted from each input string. This segment is presented as a standalone number, stripped of its context within the full telephone number. The output is qualitative, representing a specific part of the structured input data. The output values retain the formatting of the original data, including leading zeros where they appear in the input.

### Relationship Between Input and Output

The relationship between the input and output data is a direct extraction process where the output is a specific component of the input data. Specifically, the output is the first segment of the telephone number that follows immediately after the country code and the initial space in the input string. This process involves identifying the structure of the input string, segmenting it based on predefined separators (in this case, the space and hyphens), and extracting the relevant portion as the output. The operation is consistent across all data points, indicating a systematic method of deriving the output from the input. This relationship highlights the importance of understanding the structure and formatting of the input data to accurately extract and represent the desired information., and input as ['+106 769-858-438'] output is 769, input as ['+83 973-757-831'] output is 973, input as ['+62 647-787-775'] output is 647, input as ['+172 027-507-632'] output is 027, input as ['+72 001-050-856'] output is 001, input as ['+95 310-537-401'] output is 310, input as ['+6 775-969-238'] output is 775, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
