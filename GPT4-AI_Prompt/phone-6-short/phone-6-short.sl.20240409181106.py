Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Summary of Input Column Data:

The input data consists of strings formatted as telephone numbers with an international dialing format. Each entry begins with a plus sign (+) followed by a country code (which varies in length), a space, and then a sequence of digits separated into three groups by hyphens. The first group after the country code consists of three or four digits, the second and third groups also consist of three digits each. The format can be summarized as follows: `+<country code> <XXX or XXXX>-XXX-XXX`. The variation in the length of the country code and the first group of digits after the country code indicates a diversity in the geographical origin or the telecommunication systems represented in the data.

### Summary of Output Column Data:

The output data extracts and presents a specific segment from the input data, specifically the first group of digits immediately following the country code and the initial space. This segment varies in length from three to four digits, depending on the input. The output data ignores the country code and the latter two groups of digits, focusing solely on this first group as its point of interest.

### Relationship Between Input and Output:

The relationship between the input and output data is a selective extraction process where the output is derived by isolating a specific portion of the input data. The output consistently represents the first group of digits that follow the country code in the input string. This extraction process disregards the country code and the remaining two groups of digits, focusing on capturing the initial segment of the local part of the phone number. This process highlights a pattern of interest or relevance attributed to this particular segment across the different entries, possibly indicating its significance in the context of the data's use or analysis. The method of extraction does not alter the content of the selected data but simply isolates it from the larger string, maintaining its original format whether it be three or four digits in length., and input as ['+106 769-858-438'] output is 769, input as ['+83 973-757-831'] output is 973, input as ['+62 647-787-775'] output is 647, input as ['+172 027-507-632'] output is 027, input as ['+72 001-050-856'] output is 001, input as ['+95 310-537-401'] output is 310, input as ['+6 775-969-238'] output is 775, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
