Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Summary of Input Column Data

The input column data consists of company names that are primarily related to the trucking industry. These names are presented in a formal structure, often including legal identifiers such as "Inc." or "LLC" to denote their incorporation status or limited liability status, respectively. The names vary in length and complexity, ranging from simple, straightforward names to more complex ones that may include abbreviations or additional descriptive terms. The common theme across all entries is their association with the trucking sector, suggesting a focus on businesses that operate within this industry. The presence of legal identifiers indicates that these are established entities recognized as corporate or limited liability entities.

### Summary of Output Column Data

The output column data simplifies the input company names by removing legal identifiers such as "Inc." and "LLC." This process distills the names down to their core identifiers, focusing on the most descriptive elements of the name that pertain to the business's identity or primary operation. The output retains the key terms that are indicative of the company's activities or branding, such as "Trucking" or specific names that might denote ownership or a particular focus within the trucking industry. The simplification process results in cleaner, more concise names that are easier to recognize and remember without the formal legal designations.

### Relationship Between Input and Output

The transformation from the input to the output column data demonstrates a process of simplification and clarification of company names within the trucking industry. By removing the legal designations, the output focuses on the essence of each company's identity, making it more accessible and straightforward for general understanding or branding purposes. This process highlights the importance of the core name elements that directly relate to the company's operations or market identity, stripping away the formalities that are less relevant to the public's perception or the company's branding efforts. The relationship between the input and output underscores a prioritization of clarity and brevity in business communication, particularly in how companies are identified and referred to in less formal or marketing-oriented contexts., and input as ['Trucking Inc.'] output is Trucking, input as ['New Truck Inc'] output is New Truck, input as ['ABV Trucking Inc, LLC'] output is ABV Trucking, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
