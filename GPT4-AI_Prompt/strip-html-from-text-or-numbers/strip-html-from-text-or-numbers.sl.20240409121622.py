Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Summary of Input Column Data

The input data consists of strings encapsulated within HTML bold tags (`<b>` and `<b>`). Each string represents a numerical value, formatted as a decimal number. The values within the tags vary in their decimal length, indicating a potential range of precision or significance attributed to each number. The input data, treated as qualitative due to its representation within HTML tags and as strings, suggests a focus on the visual emphasis or importance of these numbers, possibly for display purposes in a web context or document where formatting plays a crucial role in conveying information.

### Summary of Output Column Data

The output data extracts the numerical values from the input strings, removing the HTML bold tags and presenting the numbers in their raw decimal form. This transformation from a string within HTML tags to a pure numerical representation signifies a process of data cleaning or extraction, where the emphasis shifts from the visual presentation of the data to its quantitative value. The output retains the precision of the input numbers, indicating that the significance of the decimal places is preserved in the transition from qualitative to quantitative data.

### Relationship Between Input and Output

The relationship between the input and output data demonstrates a process of extracting essential quantitative information from a qualitative format. This process involves removing the HTML formatting that categorizes the data as qualitative and focusing on the numerical value contained within, thus transitioning the data from a format meant for visual or textual emphasis to one that is ready for numerical analysis or computation. The consistent preservation of decimal precision in the output highlights an attention to detail in the extraction process, ensuring that the quantitative significance of the original data is not lost. This transformation is crucial in contexts where both the presentation and the accurate analysis of numerical data are important, such as in web content management, data reporting, and scientific research where initial data might be captured or displayed in a formatted manner but needs to be processed or analyzed quantitatively., and input as ['<b>0.66<b>'] output is 0.66, input as ['<b>0.409<b>'] output is 0.409, input as ['<b>0.7268<b>'] output is 0.7268, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
