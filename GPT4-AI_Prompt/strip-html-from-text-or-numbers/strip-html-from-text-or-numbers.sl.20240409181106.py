Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Summary for Input Column Data:

The input data consists of strings that follow a specific format: each string is enclosed within a pair of HTML bold tags (`<b>` and `<b>`). However, it's important to note that the closing tag appears to be incorrectly formatted as it mirrors the opening tag instead of being `</b>`. Each string encapsulates a numeric value, represented in a decimal format. The numeric values vary in their decimal length, indicating a level of precision or specificity in the data. The input data, being qualitative in nature due to its textual and HTML tag encapsulated format, represents a structured way of highlighting or emphasizing numeric information, possibly for display purposes in a web environment or a document that supports HTML formatting.

### Summary for Output Column Data:

The output data consists of numeric values extracted from the input strings. These values are presented in a decimal format, retaining the precision as provided in the input data. The transformation from the input to the output involves stripping the HTML bold tags and converting the remaining string into a numeric format. This process effectively transforms the qualitative nature of the input data into a quantitative format, suitable for numerical analysis or further processing that requires numeric values.

### Relationship Between Input and Output:

The relationship between the input and output data is characterized by a data cleaning or extraction process, where the goal is to isolate and convert the numeric information embedded within HTML tags from the input strings into a pure numeric format. This transformation is crucial for several reasons:

1. **Data Usability**: Converting the data from a qualitative, text-based format to a quantitative, numeric format makes it usable for mathematical operations, statistical analysis, or any process that requires numeric input.

2. **Data Presentation to Data Analysis Transition**: The input data, formatted with HTML tags, suggests an initial focus on data presentation. By extracting the numeric values, the focus shifts towards data analysis, enabling a transition from presentation to analytical utility.

3. **Data Cleaning**: The process highlights a common data preparation step - cleaning data by removing unnecessary or redundant formatting to isolate the core data of interest, in this case, the numeric values.

4. **Precision Retention**: The relationship also underscores the importance of retaining the precision of the numeric data through the extraction process, as the output values exactly match the precision of the input values, indicating a lossless transformation.

In summary, the relationship between the input and output data underscores the transformation from a qualitative, presentation-focused format to a quantitative, analysis-ready format, emphasizing the importance of data cleaning and precision retention in data preparation processes., and input as ['<b>0.66<b>'] output is 0.66, input as ['<b>0.409<b>'] output is 0.409, input as ['<b>0.7268<b>'] output is 0.7268, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
