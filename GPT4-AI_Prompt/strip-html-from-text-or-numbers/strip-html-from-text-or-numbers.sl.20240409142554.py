Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Summary for Input Column Data

The input data is presented in a consistent format, encapsulated within HTML bold tags (`<b>` and `<b>`). Each entry in the input column is a string that represents a numerical value, specifically a decimal number. The numbers vary in magnitude and precision, indicating a variety of values that could represent measurements, percentages, or other quantitative data in a qualitative format. The use of HTML tags suggests that the data might be extracted from a web source or is intended for display in a web-based environment. The consistency in the format across all entries suggests a standardized method of data representation, likely automated or following a strict guideline.

### Summary for Output Column Data

The output data is a direct numerical representation of the values encapsulated within the HTML bold tags in the input data. Each output is a floating-point number, accurately reflecting the value presented in the input but stripped of its HTML formatting. This transformation from a string format to a numerical format indicates a process of data cleaning or preparation, making the values ready for numerical analysis or other quantitative operations. The output retains the precision of the input values, ensuring no loss of information in the transformation process.

### Relationship Between Input and Output

The relationship between the input and output data is a process of data extraction and conversion from a qualitative to a quantitative representation. The input data, while presented in a qualitative format (strings within HTML tags), inherently contains quantitative information (numerical values). The process extracts these numerical values from their qualitative encasements, converting them into a purely numerical format suitable for quantitative analysis.

This transformation facilitates a wide range of potential analyses and operations on the data, from statistical analyses to mathematical computations, which would not be directly possible with the input data in its original format. The consistent format of the input data and the precision retention in the output data suggest a high level of control and accuracy in the data processing method, ensuring that the quantitative essence of the input is fully captured and represented in the output., and input as ['<b>0.66<b>'] output is 0.66, input as ['<b>0.409<b>'] output is 0.409, input as ['<b>0.7268<b>'] output is 0.7268, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
