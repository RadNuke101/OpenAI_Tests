Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Summary of Input Data Column

The input data consists of a series of strings formatted as phone numbers or similar numerical sequences, each separated by hyphens. Each string is structured in a three-part format, with the parts separated by hyphens ("-"). The format follows a consistent pattern of three numerical blocks: the first block consists of three digits, the second block also consists of three digits, and the third block consists of three digits as well. The input data does not convey any explicit geographical, personal, or temporal information based solely on the structure of the numbers. The variety in the sequences suggests a diverse set of data points without any apparent numerical progression or pattern that indicates a specific order or categorization.

### Summary of Output Data Column

The output data retains the same numerical sequences as the input data but alters the separators from hyphens ("-") to periods ("."). This transformation changes the visual and perhaps the contextual interpretation of the data, making it resemble a more universally recognized format such as IP addresses, decimal numbers, or a stylized numerical representation. The output maintains the three-part structure of the input data, ensuring that the integrity and the segmentation of the original sequences are preserved. The conversion does not alter the numerical values themselves but only the symbol used to separate the segments.

### Relationship Between Input and Output

The transformation from the input to the output column data is characterized by a simple yet specific alteration in the formatting of the data points. This process involves changing the separator symbol between the numerical blocks from a hyphen to a period. This change does not affect the numerical content within each block but significantly alters the appearance and potential interpretation of the data. The consistent application of this transformation rule across all data points indicates a systematic approach to reformatting the data, suggesting that the primary objective is to maintain the original numerical sequences while adapting them to a different stylistic or contextual convention. This transformation could be aimed at standardizing the data for compatibility with systems or conventions that require the period separator, or it could be a stylistic choice for presentation purposes., and input as ['938-242-504'] output is 938.242.504, input as ['308-916-545'] output is 308.916.545, input as ['623-599-749'] output is 623.599.749, input as ['981-424-843'] output is 981.424.843, input as ['118-980-214'] output is 118.980.214, input as ['244-655-094'] output is 244.655.094, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
