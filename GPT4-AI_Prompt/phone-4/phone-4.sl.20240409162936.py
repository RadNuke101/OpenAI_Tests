Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Input Column Summary:

The input data consists of strings formatted as phone numbers or similar numerical sequences, separated by hyphens. Each string is structured in a three-part format, with each part separated by a hyphen ("-"). The format follows a consistent pattern of three groups of digits: the first group contains three digits, the second group also contains three digits, and the third group contains three digits. The data appears to be qualitative, representing identifiers, codes, or similar entities rather than quantitative values meant for mathematical operations.

### Output Column Summary:

The output data retains the same numerical sequences as the input data but alters the separators between the digit groups. Instead of hyphens, the output uses periods (".") to separate the groups of digits. The transformation from input to output does not alter the numerical sequences themselves but only the characters used to separate these sequences. The output maintains the three-part format of the input, with each part now separated by a period, following the pattern of three groups of digits: the first group with three digits, the second with three digits, and the third with three digits.

### Relationship Summary:

The relationship between the input and output data is a straightforward transformation of the separator character used within a consistent three-part numerical sequence. The transformation involves replacing hyphens ("-") in the input with periods (".") in the output, without altering the numerical sequences themselves. This process suggests a formatting change that could be relevant in contexts where the representation of the data needs to be adjusted for different standards or preferences, such as in different software applications, databases, or regional conventions. The data remains qualitative, with the transformation affecting only the presentation format, not the qualitative nature or the inherent value of the data., and input as ['938-242-504'] output is 938.242.504, input as ['308-916-545'] output is 308.916.545, input as ['623-599-749'] output is 623.599.749, input as ['981-424-843'] output is 981.424.843, input as ['118-980-214'] output is 118.980.214, input as ['244-655-094'] output is 244.655.094, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
