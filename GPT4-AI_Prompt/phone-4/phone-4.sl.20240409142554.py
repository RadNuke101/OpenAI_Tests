Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Input Column Summary:

The input data consists of a series of strings formatted as phone numbers or similar numerical sequences, each separated by hyphens. Each string is structured in a three-part format, with each part separated by a hyphen ("-"). The format follows the pattern XXX-XXX-XXX, where "X" represents a digit. The data does not convey any explicit geographical, temporal, or categorical information by itself and should be treated as qualitative identifiers or codes.

### Output Column Summary:

The output data mirrors the input data in terms of the sequence of numbers but alters the separators from hyphens ("-") to periods ("."). The transformation maintains the original sequence of numbers while only changing the delimiter. The output retains the three-part structure, now formatted as XXX.XXX.XXX, making it resemble a different style of numerical or identifier representation, possibly suggesting a stylistic or contextual preference for the use of periods over hyphens in certain applications.

### Relationship Summary:

The relationship between the input and output data columns is a straightforward transformation of the delimiter character used within each string. The numerical sequences remain unchanged, indicating that the essence or value of the data is preserved during this transformation. This process could be interpreted as a formatting operation, where the input data's format is not suitable for a specific application or standard, and thus, it is converted into a more appropriate or desired format (hyphens to periods) for the output. This kind of operation is common in data preprocessing, where data must be standardized or formatted according to specific requirements for further processing, analysis, or display., and input as ['938-242-504'] output is 938.242.504, input as ['308-916-545'] output is 308.916.545, input as ['623-599-749'] output is 623.599.749, input as ['981-424-843'] output is 981.424.843, input as ['118-980-214'] output is 118.980.214, input as ['244-655-094'] output is 244.655.094, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
