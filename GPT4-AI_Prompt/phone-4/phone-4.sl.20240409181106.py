Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Summary of Input Column Data:

The input data consists of strings formatted as phone numbers or similar numerical sequences, separated by hyphens. Each string follows a consistent pattern of three groups of digits, with the groups being separated by hyphens. The first group contains three digits, the second group also contains three digits, and the third group contains three digits, following the pattern `XXX-XXX-XXX`. The data appears to be uniformly structured, with no apparent deviations from this pattern. The numbers themselves do not seem to follow any specific numerical sequence or pattern and appear to be randomly generated or selected.

### Summary of Output Column Data:

The output data closely mirrors the input data in terms of the numerical sequences provided. However, the primary difference lies in the separation character used between the groups of digits. Instead of hyphens (`-`), the output uses periods (`.`) to separate the groups, following the pattern `XXX.XXX.XXX`. This change in separators is consistent across all data points, with no deviations observed. The numerical sequences themselves remain unchanged from the input to the output, indicating a direct transformation of the format without altering the numbers.

### Relationship Summary:

The relationship between the input and output data is straightforward and consistent. The transformation process involves changing the character used to separate the groups of digits in each sequence from a hyphen to a period. There is no alteration to the order of digits, the number of digits, or the grouping of digits. The process can be summarized as a simple format change, specifically changing the separator character while retaining the original numerical data intact. This transformation suggests a focus on reformatting data for consistency, readability, or to meet specific formatting requirements, without modifying the underlying numerical information., and input as ['938-242-504'] output is 938.242.504, input as ['308-916-545'] output is 308.916.545, input as ['623-599-749'] output is 623.599.749, input as ['981-424-843'] output is 981.424.843, input as ['118-980-214'] output is 118.980.214, input as ['244-655-094'] output is 244.655.094, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
