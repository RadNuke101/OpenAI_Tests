Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Based on the provided data, we can observe a clear relationship between the input and output columns. The input data is structured in a consistent format, where each entry is a string of numbers separated by dashes, following the pattern 'XXX-YYY-ZZZ'. The output data, on the other hand, is a single number for each input.

### Summary for Input Column Data:
- The input data consists of strings formatted as 'XXX-YYY-ZZZ', where X, Y, and Z represent digits.
- Each string is divided into three parts by dashes.
- The parts consist of three digits each, making the total length of each input string 11 characters, including the dashes.

### Summary for Output Column Data:
- The output data for each input is a three-digit number.
- This number corresponds to the middle part (YYY) of the input string.

### Relationship Summary:
The relationship between the input and output data is straightforward. The output is extracted directly from the input data, specifically from the middle segment of each input string. In other words, for an input of the form 'XXX-YYY-ZZZ', the output is always the 'YYY' part. This indicates that the process to obtain the output from the input involves parsing the input string and extracting the middle sequence of digits.

This relationship suggests that the task is essentially one of data extraction, where the input data's structure allows for a predictable extraction of a specific portion to serve as the output. The process does not involve any transformation or calculation of the input data beyond this extraction., and input as ['938-242-504'] output is 242, input as ['308-916-545'] output is 916, input as ['623-599-749'] output is 599, input as ['981-424-843'] output is 424, input as ['118-980-214'] output is 980, input as ['244-655-094'] output is 655, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
