Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Based on the provided data, we can observe a specific pattern that relates the input to the output. The input data is structured in a consistent format, where each entry is a string of numbers divided into three segments by hyphens (e.g., 'XXX-YYY-ZZZ'). The output data, in each case, corresponds to the middle segment of the input string.

**Input Column Summary:**
- The input data consists of strings formatted as 'XXX-YYY-ZZZ', where XXX, YYY, and ZZZ are three-digit numbers.
- Each input string is divided into three segments by hyphens.
- The data does not indicate any specific pattern or sequence within the segments themselves, treating them as qualitative data.

**Output Column Summary:**
- The output data for each input entry is a three-digit number.
- This number is always the middle segment (YYY) of the corresponding input string.
- The output data, therefore, directly relates to the structure of the input data rather than any numerical value or calculation derived from it.

**Relationship Summary:**
- The relationship between the input and output data is straightforward and consistent across all provided examples. The output is always extracted directly from the input, specifically being the middle segment of the input string.
- This relationship indicates that the process to obtain the output from the input is a matter of parsing the input string and extracting the specific segment, rather than performing any mathematical or logical operations on the data.
- The data treats the numbers qualitatively, meaning the focus is on the structure and position of the numbers within the string rather than their numerical value.

In summary, the relationship between the input and output columns is defined by the position of the data within the input string, with the output always being the middle segment of the input. This pattern is consistent across all provided examples, indicating a clear method for predicting the output from any given input following the same format., and input as ['938-242-504'] output is 242, input as ['308-916-545'] output is 916, input as ['623-599-749'] output is 599, input as ['981-424-843'] output is 424, input as ['118-980-214'] output is 980, input as ['244-655-094'] output is 655, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
