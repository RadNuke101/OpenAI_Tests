Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Input Column Summary:

The input column consists of a list of full names, each comprising a first name followed by a last name. These names represent a diverse set of individuals, with a wide variety of first names and last names that suggest a multicultural background. The names are structured in a consistent format, with the first name leading, followed by the last name, and each name is unique within this dataset. The names span across different origins and cultures, indicating a broad and inclusive selection. The dataset does not specify any additional information about the individuals, such as their profession, age, or gender.

### Output Column Summary:

The output column transforms each full name from the input column into a professional title format, specifically by prefixing each first name with "Dr." This transformation indicates a conferment or acknowledgment of a doctoral level or professional status but does not specify the field of expertise or study. The last names are omitted in the output, focusing solely on the individual's first name coupled with the professional title. This simplification suggests a formal yet personal recognition, emphasizing the individual's achievement or status without delving into their specific domain of expertise.

### Relationship Between Input and Output:

The relationship between the input and output columns is a transformation process that elevates each individual's name from a personal identifier to a professional designation. This process involves two key steps: the addition of a professional title ("Dr.") before each first name and the removal of the last name. The consistent application of this transformation across a diverse set of names highlights a universal acknowledgment of professional or academic achievement, irrespective of the individual's background or field. The transformation suggests a formalization of status while maintaining a level of personal recognition by retaining the first name. This process effectively bridges personal identity with professional acknowledgment, creating a uniform output that signifies respect and achievement., and input as ['Launa Withers'] output is Dr. Launa, input as ['Lakenya Edison'] output is Dr. Lakenya, input as ['Brendan Hage'] output is Dr. Brendan, input as ['Bradford Lango'] output is Dr. Bradford, input as ['Rudolf Akiyama'] output is Dr. Rudolf, input as ['Lara Constable'] output is Dr. Lara, input as ['Madelaine Ghoston'] output is Dr. Madelaine, input as ['Salley Hornak'] output is Dr. Salley, input as ['Micha Junkin'] output is Dr. Micha, input as ['Teddy Bobo'] output is Dr. Teddy, input as ['Coralee Scalia'] output is Dr. Coralee, input as ['Jeff Quashie'] output is Dr. Jeff, input as ['Vena Babiarz'] output is Dr. Vena, input as ['Karrie Lain'] output is Dr. Karrie, input as ['Tobias Dermody'] output is Dr. Tobias, input as ['Celsa Hopkins'] output is Dr. Celsa, input as ['Kimberley Halpern'] output is Dr. Kimberley, input as ['Phillip Rowden'] output is Dr. Phillip, input as ['Elias Neil'] output is Dr. Elias, input as ['Lashanda Cortes'] output is Dr. Lashanda, input as ['Mackenzie Spell'] output is Dr. Mackenzie, input as ['Kathlyn Eccleston'] output is Dr. Kathlyn, input as ['Georgina Brescia'] output is Dr. Georgina, input as ['Beata Miah'] output is Dr. Beata, input as ['Desiree Seamons'] output is Dr. Desiree, input as ['Jeanice Soderstrom'] output is Dr. Jeanice, input as ['Mariel Jurgens'] output is Dr. Mariel, input as ['Alida Bogle'] output is Dr. Alida, input as ['Jacqualine Olague'] output is Dr. Jacqualine, input as ['Joaquin Clasen'] output is Dr. Joaquin, input as ['Samuel Richert'] output is Dr. Samuel, input as ['Malissa Marcus'] output is Dr. Malissa, input as ['Alaina Partida'] output is Dr. Alaina, input as ['Trinidad Mulloy'] output is Dr. Trinidad, input as ['Carlene Garrard'] output is Dr. Carlene, input as ['Melodi Chism'] output is Dr. Melodi, input as ['Bess Chilcott'] output is Dr. Bess, input as ['Chong Aylward'] output is Dr. Chong, input as ['Jani Ramthun'] output is Dr. Jani, input as ['Jacquiline Heintz'] output is Dr. Jacquiline, input as ['Hayley Marquess'] output is Dr. Hayley, input as ['Andria Spagnoli'] output is Dr. Andria, input as ['Irwin Covelli'] output is Dr. Irwin, input as ['Gertude Montiel'] output is Dr. Gertude, input as ['Stefany Reily'] output is Dr. Stefany, input as ['Rae Mcgaughey'] output is Dr. Rae, input as ['Cruz Latimore'] output is Dr. Cruz, input as ['Maryann Casler'] output is Dr. Maryann, input as ['Annalisa Gregori'] output is Dr. Annalisa, input as ['Jenee Pannell'] output is Dr. Jenee, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
