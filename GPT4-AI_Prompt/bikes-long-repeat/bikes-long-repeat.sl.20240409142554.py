Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Input Column Summary:

The input data consists of a series of strings that combine a brand name with a numerical value, presumably representing a model or specification related to the brand. The brands mentioned in the input data include Ducati, Honda, Acura, and Ferrari. The numerical values attached to these brand names vary, including 100, 125, 250, and 550. These combinations suggest a categorization of models or products under each brand, differentiated by the numerical value which could indicate aspects such as engine capacity, power, or a model series identifier.

### Output Column Summary:

The output data extracts and presents only the brand name component from each input string, disregarding the numerical values entirely. This process simplifies the input data from specific models or specifications to a broader categorization by brand name alone. The output includes the brand names Ducati, Honda, Acura, and Ferrari, corresponding directly to the brands identified in the input data without any reference to the numerical values that were initially attached to them.

### Relationship Summary:

The relationship between the input and output data is a process of abstraction, where the input's detailed information (brand name combined with a numerical value) is simplified to retain only the brand name in the output. This transformation indicates a focus on the qualitative aspect of the data (the brand) over the quantitative or specific model details (the numerical value). The process effectively categorizes the input data by brand, making it easier to understand the distribution or frequency of each brand within the dataset without being encumbered by the specifics of each model or specification. This could be particularly useful for analyses or applications where the distinction between different models of the same brand is irrelevant, and the primary interest is in the presence or frequency of the brands themselves., and input as ['Ducati100'] output is Ducati, input as ['Ducati100'] output is Ducati, input as ['Ducati100'] output is Ducati, input as ['Honda125'] output is Honda, input as ['Honda125'] output is Honda, input as ['Honda125'] output is Honda, input as ['Ducati250'] output is Ducati, input as ['Ducati250'] output is Ducati, input as ['Ducati250'] output is Ducati, input as ['Honda250'] output is Honda, input as ['Honda250'] output is Honda, input as ['Honda250'] output is Honda, input as ['Honda550'] output is Honda, input as ['Honda550'] output is Honda, input as ['Honda550'] output is Honda, input as ['Ducati125'] output is Ducati, input as ['Ducati125'] output is Ducati, input as ['Ducati125'] output is Ducati, input as ['Acura100'] output is Acura, input as ['Acura100'] output is Acura, input as ['Acura100'] output is Acura, input as ['Acura125'] output is Acura, input as ['Ferrari250'] output is Ferrari, input as ['Ferrari250'] output is Ferrari, input as ['Ferrari250'] output is Ferrari, input as ['Ferrari250'] output is Ferrari, input as ['Honda550'] output is Honda, input as ['Honda550'] output is Honda, input as ['Honda550'] output is Honda, input as ['Ducati125'] output is Ducati, input as ['Ducati125'] output is Ducati, input as ['Ducati125'] output is Ducati, input as ['Ducati100'] output is Ducati, input as ['Honda125'] output is Honda, input as ['Honda125'] output is Honda, input as ['Honda125'] output is Honda, input as ['Ducati250'] output is Ducati, input as ['Honda250'] output is Honda, input as ['Honda250'] output is Honda, input as ['Honda250'] output is Honda, input as ['Honda550'] output is Honda, input as ['Ducati125'] output is Ducati, input as ['Ducati125'] output is Ducati, input as ['Ducati125'] output is Ducati, input as ['Acura100'] output is Acura, input as ['Acura125'] output is Acura, input as ['Acura125'] output is Acura, input as ['Acura125'] output is Acura, input as ['Ferrari250'] output is Ferrari, input as ['Ferrari250'] output is Ferrari, input as ['Ferrari250'] output is Ferrari, input as ['Honda550'] output is Honda, input as ['Honda550'] output is Honda, input as ['Honda550'] output is Honda, input as ['Ducati125'] output is Ducati, input as ['Ducati125'] output is Ducati, input as ['Ducati125'] output is Ducati, input as ['Ducati125'] output is Ducati, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
