Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Input Column Summary:

The input data consists of strings that are a combination of a brand name and a numerical value, likely representing a model or specification related to the brand. The brands mentioned in the input data include Ducati, Honda, Acura, and Ferrari. The numerical values appended to these brand names vary, including but not limited to 100, 125, 250, and 550. These combinations suggest a structured naming convention where each brand has multiple models or variants, distinguished by the numbers.

### Output Column Summary:

The output data extracts and presents only the brand name part of the input strings, disregarding the numerical values. This process consistently applies across all input data, regardless of the brand or the numerical value attached. The output thus focuses solely on the qualitative aspect of the input data, specifically the brand identity, without considering the quantitative aspect (the numerical values).

### Relationship Summary:

The relationship between the input and output data is a straightforward extraction process where the output isolates and retains only the brand name from the input strings. This indicates a filtering or parsing operation where the goal is to identify and extract the brand component from a structured string that combines both textual (brand name) and numerical (model or specification) information. The operation is consistent across various brands and numerical values, highlighting a uniform processing approach that focuses on qualitative data (brand names) while omitting quantitative details (numerical values)., and input as ['Ducati100'] output is Ducati, input as ['Ducati100'] output is Ducati, input as ['Ducati100'] output is Ducati, input as ['Honda125'] output is Honda, input as ['Honda125'] output is Honda, input as ['Honda125'] output is Honda, input as ['Ducati250'] output is Ducati, input as ['Ducati250'] output is Ducati, input as ['Ducati250'] output is Ducati, input as ['Honda250'] output is Honda, input as ['Honda250'] output is Honda, input as ['Honda250'] output is Honda, input as ['Honda550'] output is Honda, input as ['Honda550'] output is Honda, input as ['Honda550'] output is Honda, input as ['Ducati125'] output is Ducati, input as ['Ducati125'] output is Ducati, input as ['Ducati125'] output is Ducati, input as ['Acura100'] output is Acura, input as ['Acura100'] output is Acura, input as ['Acura100'] output is Acura, input as ['Acura125'] output is Acura, input as ['Ferrari250'] output is Ferrari, input as ['Ferrari250'] output is Ferrari, input as ['Ferrari250'] output is Ferrari, input as ['Ferrari250'] output is Ferrari, input as ['Honda550'] output is Honda, input as ['Honda550'] output is Honda, input as ['Honda550'] output is Honda, input as ['Ducati125'] output is Ducati, input as ['Ducati125'] output is Ducati, input as ['Ducati125'] output is Ducati, input as ['Ducati100'] output is Ducati, input as ['Honda125'] output is Honda, input as ['Honda125'] output is Honda, input as ['Honda125'] output is Honda, input as ['Ducati250'] output is Ducati, input as ['Honda250'] output is Honda, input as ['Honda250'] output is Honda, input as ['Honda250'] output is Honda, input as ['Honda550'] output is Honda, input as ['Ducati125'] output is Ducati, input as ['Ducati125'] output is Ducati, input as ['Ducati125'] output is Ducati, input as ['Acura100'] output is Acura, input as ['Acura125'] output is Acura, input as ['Acura125'] output is Acura, input as ['Acura125'] output is Acura, input as ['Ferrari250'] output is Ferrari, input as ['Ferrari250'] output is Ferrari, input as ['Ferrari250'] output is Ferrari, input as ['Honda550'] output is Honda, input as ['Honda550'] output is Honda, input as ['Honda550'] output is Honda, input as ['Ducati125'] output is Ducati, input as ['Ducati125'] output is Ducati, input as ['Ducati125'] output is Ducati, input as ['Ducati125'] output is Ducati, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
