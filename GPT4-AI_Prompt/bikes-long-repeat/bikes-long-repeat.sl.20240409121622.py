Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Input Column Summary:

The input data consists of a series of strings that combine a brand name with a numerical value, without any separating characters. The brands represented in the data include motorcycle and car manufacturers such as Ducati, Honda, Acura, and Ferrari. The numerical values appended to these brand names vary and include 100, 125, 250, and 550. These numbers could potentially represent model numbers, engine sizes in cubic centimeters (cc), or other product-specific identifiers, but the context provided does not specify their exact meaning. The input data is repetitive, with multiple instances of the same brand and number combination appearing.

### Output Column Summary:

The output data extracts and isolates the brand name component from the input strings, disregarding the numerical values entirely. The result is a series of brand names that correspond directly to the brand component of each input string. The output data includes the names Ducati, Honda, Acura, and Ferrari, reflecting the diversity of brands present in the input data. There is a direct, one-to-one relationship between the input and output data, where each input string yields an output string that is the brand name extracted from the input.

### Relationship Summary:

The relationship between the input and output data is characterized by a consistent transformation process, where the output is derived by extracting the alphabetical brand name portion from the input strings, and discarding the numerical values. This process is applied uniformly across all input data, regardless of the specific brand or numerical value involved. The transformation does not alter the order or frequency of occurrences for each brand, meaning that the output maintains the same distribution and repetition of brand names as observed in the input. This indicates that the purpose of the transformation is to isolate the brand component for analysis or further processing, without consideration for the numerical values that might signify model specifications or other attributes., and input as ['Ducati100'] output is Ducati, input as ['Ducati100'] output is Ducati, input as ['Ducati100'] output is Ducati, input as ['Honda125'] output is Honda, input as ['Honda125'] output is Honda, input as ['Honda125'] output is Honda, input as ['Ducati250'] output is Ducati, input as ['Ducati250'] output is Ducati, input as ['Ducati250'] output is Ducati, input as ['Honda250'] output is Honda, input as ['Honda250'] output is Honda, input as ['Honda250'] output is Honda, input as ['Honda550'] output is Honda, input as ['Honda550'] output is Honda, input as ['Honda550'] output is Honda, input as ['Ducati125'] output is Ducati, input as ['Ducati125'] output is Ducati, input as ['Ducati125'] output is Ducati, input as ['Acura100'] output is Acura, input as ['Acura100'] output is Acura, input as ['Acura100'] output is Acura, input as ['Acura125'] output is Acura, input as ['Ferrari250'] output is Ferrari, input as ['Ferrari250'] output is Ferrari, input as ['Ferrari250'] output is Ferrari, input as ['Ferrari250'] output is Ferrari, input as ['Honda550'] output is Honda, input as ['Honda550'] output is Honda, input as ['Honda550'] output is Honda, input as ['Ducati125'] output is Ducati, input as ['Ducati125'] output is Ducati, input as ['Ducati125'] output is Ducati, input as ['Ducati100'] output is Ducati, input as ['Honda125'] output is Honda, input as ['Honda125'] output is Honda, input as ['Honda125'] output is Honda, input as ['Ducati250'] output is Ducati, input as ['Honda250'] output is Honda, input as ['Honda250'] output is Honda, input as ['Honda250'] output is Honda, input as ['Honda550'] output is Honda, input as ['Ducati125'] output is Ducati, input as ['Ducati125'] output is Ducati, input as ['Ducati125'] output is Ducati, input as ['Acura100'] output is Acura, input as ['Acura125'] output is Acura, input as ['Acura125'] output is Acura, input as ['Acura125'] output is Acura, input as ['Ferrari250'] output is Ferrari, input as ['Ferrari250'] output is Ferrari, input as ['Ferrari250'] output is Ferrari, input as ['Honda550'] output is Honda, input as ['Honda550'] output is Honda, input as ['Honda550'] output is Honda, input as ['Ducati125'] output is Ducati, input as ['Ducati125'] output is Ducati, input as ['Ducati125'] output is Ducati, input as ['Ducati125'] output is Ducati, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
