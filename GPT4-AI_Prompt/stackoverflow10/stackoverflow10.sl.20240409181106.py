Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Input Column Summary:

The input data consists of strings representing specific dates, with most entries following a standard format of "[Month] [Day] [Year]". However, some entries include additional context or descriptors after the year, such as "as Delaware Township" or "<as Raritan Township>", indicating a significant event or designation that took place on that date. The dates range across a wide span of years, from the early 18th century to the late 19th century, specifically between 1721 and 1892. The months mentioned are diverse, including January, February, March, April, July, and others, suggesting no specific seasonal focus. The days of the month vary widely as well, indicating that the dates do not concentrate around any particular time of the month. The additional descriptors, when present, seem to relate to geographical or administrative changes, possibly indicating the establishment or renaming of townships or other jurisdictions.

### Output Column Summary:

The output data consists of four-digit numbers, each representing a year extracted from the corresponding input string. These years range from 1721 to 1892, aligning with the dates provided in the input column. The output data is purely numerical and does not include any context or descriptors that might be present in the input data. This simplification suggests that the primary focus of the output is to isolate the year component from the more complex date and contextual information provided in the input.

### Relationship Summary:

The relationship between the input and output data is straightforward: the output is derived by extracting the year component from the input date strings. Regardless of the format variations in the input data, including additional context or descriptors, the output consistently focuses on isolating the year. This process of extraction indicates a filtering or simplification operation where only the year, a significant temporal marker, is retained for the output. The presence of additional context in some input entries, which is omitted in the output, suggests that the purpose of the output is to highlight or catalog the years of interest, possibly for a timeline, historical analysis, or record-keeping, without the need for the more detailed information included in the input., and input as ['April 1 1799'] output is 1799, input as ['April 11 1867'] output is 1867, input as ['February 12 1806'] output is 1806, input as ['February 21 1798'] output is 1798, input as ['February 28 1844 as Delaware Township'] output is 1844, input as ['February 5 1798'] output is 1798, input as ['February 7 1892 Verona Township'] output is 1892, input as ['February 9 1797'] output is 1797, input as ['January 19 1748'] output is 1748, input as ['July 10 1721 as Upper Penns Neck Township'] output is 1721, input as ['March 15 1860'] output is 1860, input as ['March 17 1870 <as Raritan Township>'] output is 1870, input as ['March 17 1874'] output is 1874, input as ['March 23 1864'] output is 1864, input as ['March 5 1867'] output is 1867, input as ['April 28th 1828'] output is 1828, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
