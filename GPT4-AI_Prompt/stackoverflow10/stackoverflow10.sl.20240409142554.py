Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Input Column Summary:

The input column consists of strings that represent specific dates, with most entries following the format of "[Month] [Day] [Year]". Some entries also include additional context or descriptions following the date, such as the naming or establishment of a township (e.g., "as Delaware Township", "Verona Township", "<as Raritan Township>", "as Upper Penns Neck Township"). The dates span a wide range of years, from the early 18th century to the late 19th century, indicating a historical context for the data. The months mentioned are varied, including January, February, March, April, July, and others, showing no particular bias towards a specific time of the year. The additional descriptions, where present, are enclosed in different ways, including plain text, and within angle brackets, suggesting a lack of uniformity in how supplementary information is presented.

### Output Column Summary:

The output column consists of four-digit numbers, each representing a year. These years range from the early 18th century (1721) to the late 19th century (1892). The output data is strictly numerical and appears to be extracted directly from the input data, specifically representing the year component of the dates provided in the input column.

### Relationship Summary:

The relationship between the input and output columns is straightforward: the output is derived from the input by extracting the year component of the date mentioned in each input string. Regardless of the format variations in the input data, such as the presence or absence of additional descriptive text following the date, the output consistently focuses on isolating and presenting the year as a four-digit number. This extraction process ignores all other elements of the input, including the day, month, and any supplementary descriptions or context provided about the date. The relationship underscores a filtering process that prioritizes the retrieval of chronological information (the year) from a more complex dataset that includes both temporal and descriptive data., and input as ['April 1 1799'] output is 1799, input as ['April 11 1867'] output is 1867, input as ['February 12 1806'] output is 1806, input as ['February 21 1798'] output is 1798, input as ['February 28 1844 as Delaware Township'] output is 1844, input as ['February 5 1798'] output is 1798, input as ['February 7 1892 Verona Township'] output is 1892, input as ['February 9 1797'] output is 1797, input as ['January 19 1748'] output is 1748, input as ['July 10 1721 as Upper Penns Neck Township'] output is 1721, input as ['March 15 1860'] output is 1860, input as ['March 17 1870 <as Raritan Township>'] output is 1870, input as ['March 17 1874'] output is 1874, input as ['March 23 1864'] output is 1864, input as ['March 5 1867'] output is 1867, input as ['April 28th 1828'] output is 1828, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
