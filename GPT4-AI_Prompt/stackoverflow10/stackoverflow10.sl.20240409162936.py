Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Input Column Summary:

The input data consists of strings that represent specific dates, with most entries following a standard format of "Month Day Year". However, there are variations in the dataset where additional contextual information is provided, such as the naming or renaming of townships. These variations include phrases like "as Delaware Township" or "Verona Township" and even include annotations within angle brackets or as standalone additions to the date. The dates span a wide range of years, from the early 18th century (1721) to the late 19th century (1892), indicating a historical context for the data. The months mentioned are diverse, including January, February, March, April, July, and others, showing no specific concentration in any part of the year. The day of the month varies widely as well, from early in the month (e.g., 1st, 5th) to towards the end (e.g., 28th), indicating no specific pattern in terms of the day of the month. The additional context provided in some entries suggests a geographical or administrative significance to the dates, possibly related to the establishment or renaming of townships or other jurisdictions within a larger governance framework.

### Output Column Summary:

The output data consists of four-digit numbers representing years, ranging from the early 18th century (1721) to the late 19th century (1892). These years are extracted from the input data, indicating a focus on identifying and isolating the year component from a more complex string of information that includes the date, month, and possibly additional contextual details. The output years are significant in understanding the temporal context of the events or changes described in the input data, such as the establishment, renaming, or other significant events related to townships or administrative regions.

### Relationship Summary:

The relationship between the input and output data is a process of extracting the year component from a complex string that includes a full date and, in some cases, additional contextual information. The output focuses solely on the year, disregarding the month, day, and any extra textual details provided in the input. This extraction process highlights the importance of the year in understanding the historical context of the events described, such as administrative changes or significant events within a geographical or governance framework. The presence of additional details in the input, such as the naming of townships, suggests that the dates may correspond to significant historical events, with the year being the critical piece of information for cataloging or referencing these events. The process effectively distills the input data to a singular, significant piece of information (the year), which can be used for further analysis, historical record-keeping, or other purposes where understanding the temporal context is essential., and input as ['April 1 1799'] output is 1799, input as ['April 11 1867'] output is 1867, input as ['February 12 1806'] output is 1806, input as ['February 21 1798'] output is 1798, input as ['February 28 1844 as Delaware Township'] output is 1844, input as ['February 5 1798'] output is 1798, input as ['February 7 1892 Verona Township'] output is 1892, input as ['February 9 1797'] output is 1797, input as ['January 19 1748'] output is 1748, input as ['July 10 1721 as Upper Penns Neck Township'] output is 1721, input as ['March 15 1860'] output is 1860, input as ['March 17 1870 <as Raritan Township>'] output is 1870, input as ['March 17 1874'] output is 1874, input as ['March 23 1864'] output is 1864, input as ['March 5 1867'] output is 1867, input as ['April 28th 1828'] output is 1828, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
