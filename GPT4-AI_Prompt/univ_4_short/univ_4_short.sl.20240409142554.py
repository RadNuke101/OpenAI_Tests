Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Summary for Input Column Data:

The input data consists of two main components for each entry: the name of a university and its corresponding location. The universities mentioned are prominent institutions located in the United States, including a mix of private and public schools. These institutions are spread across various states, showcasing a geographical diversity. The names of the universities are sometimes provided in their full official form (e.g., "University of Pennsylvania"), and other times in a more colloquial or abbreviated form (e.g., "Penn", "UCLA"). The location information provided with each university name varies in detail. Some entries include the city, state, and country, while others might omit the country or use a less formal version of the state's name. The data reflects a variety of ways in which university names and their locations can be represented, indicating a need for standardization or normalization in the output.

### Summary for Output Column Data:

The output data standardizes the location information associated with each university. It consistently formats the location as "City, State Abbreviation, USA", ensuring uniformity across all entries. This standardization process involves correcting spelling errors (e.g., "Phialdelphia" to "Philadelphia"), abbreviating state names according to the U.S. postal service standard (e.g., "New York" to "NY"), and adding "USA" to entries where the country was previously omitted. The output demonstrates a clear and concise format for representing the locations of these universities, making it easier to understand and compare the geographical distribution of these institutions across the United States.

### Relationship between Input and Output:

The transformation from input to output data illustrates a process of standardization and error correction for university location information. The input data's variability in university name representation and location detail is streamlined in the output to a uniform format that is concise and easily comparable. This process not only corrects minor errors but also adds missing information (such as the country) when necessary. The relationship between the input and output underscores the importance of data normalization in enhancing clarity, consistency, and usability of location information for universities in the United States., and input as ['University of Pennsylvania', 'Phialdelphia, PA, USA'] output is Phialdelphia, PA, USA, input as ['UCLA', 'Los Angeles, CA'] output is Los Angeles, CA, USA, input as ['Cornell University', 'Ithaca, New York, USA'] output is Ithaca, NY, USA, input as ['Penn', 'Philadelphia, PA, USA'] output is Philadelphia, PA, USA, input as ['University of Maryland College Park', 'College Park, MD'] output is College Park, MD, USA, input as ['University of Michigan', 'Ann Arbor, MI, USA'] output is Ann Arbor, MI, USA, input as ['Columbia University', 'New York, NY, USA'] output is New York, NY, USA, input as ['NYU', 'New York, New York, USA'] output is New York, NY, USA, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
