Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Summary of Input Column Data

The input data consists of two columns, each containing specific information related to various universities and their locations in the United States. The first column lists the names of the universities, which include a mix of full university names (e.g., "University of Pennsylvania") and abbreviations or informal names (e.g., "UCLA" for University of California, Los Angeles). This variety indicates that the dataset includes both formal and colloquial ways of referring to these institutions. The second column provides the location of these universities, including the city and state. In some cases, the country ("USA") is also included, while in others, it is omitted. This suggests variability in how location data is recorded or presented, with some entries providing more detail than others.

### Summary of Output Column Data

The output data standardizes the location information provided in the second column of the input data. It ensures consistency in the representation of each location by including the city, state abbreviation, and the country ("USA") for every university listed. The output corrects any misspellings (e.g., "Phialdelphia" to "Philadelphia") and standardizes the format for state names by using abbreviations (e.g., "New York" to "NY"). This process of standardization makes the location data uniform across all entries, facilitating easier comparison or integration with other datasets that might require a consistent format for geographical information.

### Relationship Between Input and Output

The transformation from the input to the output data demonstrates a process of standardization and correction of university location information. The relationship between the input and output columns highlights the importance of having a uniform format for presenting location data, especially when dealing with a dataset that includes a variety of naming conventions for both institutions and their locations. By converting informal or varied representations of names and locations into a standardized format, the output makes the data more accessible and usable for various applications, such as mapping, data integration, or analysis tasks that require consistent geographical identifiers. This process also ensures that any errors or inconsistencies in the original data are corrected, improving the overall quality and reliability of the information provided., and input as ['University of Pennsylvania', 'Phialdelphia, PA, USA'] output is Phialdelphia, PA, USA, input as ['UCLA', 'Los Angeles, CA'] output is Los Angeles, CA, USA, input as ['Cornell University', 'Ithaca, New York, USA'] output is Ithaca, NY, USA, input as ['Penn', 'Philadelphia, PA, USA'] output is Philadelphia, PA, USA, input as ['University of Maryland College Park', 'College Park, MD'] output is College Park, MD, USA, input as ['University of Michigan', 'Ann Arbor, MI, USA'] output is Ann Arbor, MI, USA, input as ['Columbia University', 'New York, NY, USA'] output is New York, NY, USA, input as ['NYU', 'New York, New York, USA'] output is New York, NY, USA, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
