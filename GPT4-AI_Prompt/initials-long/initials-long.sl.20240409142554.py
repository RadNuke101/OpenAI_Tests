Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Input Column Summary:

The input column consists of a list of full names, each entry comprising a first name followed by a last name. These names represent a diverse set of individuals, with a variety of first and last names that suggest a wide range of cultural backgrounds. Each name is structured in a conventional Western format, with the given name (or first name) preceding the family name (or last name). The names are presented as single strings, with a space separating the first name from the last name. The dataset includes both male and female names, indicated by traditional gender-associated names, though no explicit gender information is provided. The names do not follow any apparent alphabetical or other systematic order.

### Output Column Summary:

The output column consists of initials derived from the corresponding full names in the input column. Each entry in the output is formatted as two capital letters separated by a period, where the first letter represents the initial of the given name and the second letter represents the initial of the family name from the input data. This format standardizes the representation of names by reducing them to their initials, thereby anonymizing and simplifying the data. The output maintains the same order as the input data, ensuring a direct, one-to-one relationship between each full name and its corresponding set of initials.

### Relationship Summary:

The relationship between the input and output columns is a transformation process where each full name from the input is converted into a pair of initials in the output. This process involves extracting the first letter from the given name and the first letter from the family name of each individual, then capitalizing these letters and formatting them with a period in between. This transformation serves to create a concise and uniform representation of the names, which could be useful for applications requiring data anonymization, simplification, or where space is limited. The method ensures that each unique full name is associated with a unique set of initials, assuming there are no two individuals with the exact same first and last name initials in the dataset. This systematic approach allows for easy cross-referencing between the original names and their simplified initials form, facilitating data handling and analysis while preserving a level of privacy for the individuals represented., and input as ['Nancy FreeHafer'] output is N.F., input as ['Andrew Cencici'] output is A.C., input as ['Jan Kotas'] output is J.K., input as ['Mariya Sergienko'] output is M.S., input as ['Launa Withers'] output is L.W., input as ['Lakenya Edison'] output is L.E., input as ['Brendan Hage'] output is B.H., input as ['Bradford Lango'] output is B.L., input as ['Rudolf Akiyama'] output is R.A., input as ['Lara Constable'] output is L.C., input as ['Madelaine Ghoston'] output is M.G., input as ['Salley Hornak'] output is S.H., input as ['Micha Junkin'] output is M.J., input as ['Teddy Bobo'] output is T.B., input as ['Coralee Scalia'] output is C.S., input as ['Jeff Quashie'] output is J.Q., input as ['Vena Babiarz'] output is V.B., input as ['Karrie Lain'] output is K.L., input as ['Tobias Dermody'] output is T.D., input as ['Celsa Hopkins'] output is C.H., input as ['Kimberley Halpern'] output is K.H., input as ['Phillip Rowden'] output is P.R., input as ['Elias Neil'] output is E.N., input as ['Lashanda Cortes'] output is L.C., input as ['Mackenzie Spell'] output is M.S., input as ['Kathlyn Eccleston'] output is K.E., input as ['Georgina Brescia'] output is G.B., input as ['Beata Miah'] output is B.M., input as ['Desiree Seamons'] output is D.S., input as ['Jeanice Soderstrom'] output is J.S., input as ['Mariel Jurgens'] output is M.J., input as ['Alida Bogle'] output is A.B., input as ['Jacqualine Olague'] output is J.O., input as ['Joaquin Clasen'] output is J.C., input as ['Samuel Richert'] output is S.R., input as ['Malissa Marcus'] output is M.M., input as ['Alaina Partida'] output is A.P., input as ['Trinidad Mulloy'] output is T.M., input as ['Carlene Garrard'] output is C.G., input as ['Melodi Chism'] output is M.C., input as ['Bess Chilcott'] output is B.C., input as ['Chong Aylward'] output is C.A., input as ['Jani Ramthun'] output is J.R., input as ['Jacquiline Heintz'] output is J.H., input as ['Hayley Marquess'] output is H.M., input as ['Andria Spagnoli'] output is A.S., input as ['Irwin Covelli'] output is I.C., input as ['Gertude Montiel'] output is G.M., input as ['Stefany Reily'] output is S.R., input as ['Rae Mcgaughey'] output is R.M., input as ['Cruz Latimore'] output is C.L., input as ['Maryann Casler'] output is M.C., input as ['Annalisa Gregori'] output is A.G., input as ['Jenee Pannell'] output is J.P., , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
