Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Input Column Summary:

The input column consists of a list of full names, each entry containing a first name followed by a last name. These names represent a diverse set of individuals, with a wide variety of first and last names suggesting a multicultural background. The names are structured in a consistent format, with each first and last name separated by a space. There are no middle names or initials included, and the dataset does not provide any additional information about the individuals, such as gender, nationality, or occupation. The names appear to be randomly selected, with no apparent order or grouping based on alphabetical order, gender, or any other discernible criteria.

### Output Column Summary:

The output column consists of initials derived from the corresponding full names in the input column. Each entry in the output column is formatted as two capital letters separated by a period, representing the first letter of the first name and the first letter of the last name from the input column. This format is consistent across all entries, providing a standardized way to abbreviate the full names. The output does not include any additional characters or spaces beyond the two initials and the separating period.

### Relationship Between Input and Output:

The relationship between the input and output columns is a direct transformation of full names into their corresponding initials. The process involves taking the first letter of the first name and the first letter of the last name from each full name in the input column and then formatting these letters as initials in the output column. This transformation is systematic and applies the same rule to all entries, resulting in a concise representation of each individual's name. The output serves as a simplified identifier for each person, potentially useful in contexts where space is limited or where privacy is a concern, as it abstracts away the full names into less identifiable forms. This method of abbreviation is commonly used in various professional, academic, and social contexts to refer to individuals in a more formal or compact manner., and input as ['Nancy FreeHafer'] output is N.F., input as ['Andrew Cencici'] output is A.C., input as ['Jan Kotas'] output is J.K., input as ['Mariya Sergienko'] output is M.S., input as ['Launa Withers'] output is L.W., input as ['Lakenya Edison'] output is L.E., input as ['Brendan Hage'] output is B.H., input as ['Bradford Lango'] output is B.L., input as ['Rudolf Akiyama'] output is R.A., input as ['Lara Constable'] output is L.C., input as ['Madelaine Ghoston'] output is M.G., input as ['Salley Hornak'] output is S.H., input as ['Micha Junkin'] output is M.J., input as ['Teddy Bobo'] output is T.B., input as ['Coralee Scalia'] output is C.S., input as ['Jeff Quashie'] output is J.Q., input as ['Vena Babiarz'] output is V.B., input as ['Karrie Lain'] output is K.L., input as ['Tobias Dermody'] output is T.D., input as ['Celsa Hopkins'] output is C.H., input as ['Kimberley Halpern'] output is K.H., input as ['Phillip Rowden'] output is P.R., input as ['Elias Neil'] output is E.N., input as ['Lashanda Cortes'] output is L.C., input as ['Mackenzie Spell'] output is M.S., input as ['Kathlyn Eccleston'] output is K.E., input as ['Georgina Brescia'] output is G.B., input as ['Beata Miah'] output is B.M., input as ['Desiree Seamons'] output is D.S., input as ['Jeanice Soderstrom'] output is J.S., input as ['Mariel Jurgens'] output is M.J., input as ['Alida Bogle'] output is A.B., input as ['Jacqualine Olague'] output is J.O., input as ['Joaquin Clasen'] output is J.C., input as ['Samuel Richert'] output is S.R., input as ['Malissa Marcus'] output is M.M., input as ['Alaina Partida'] output is A.P., input as ['Trinidad Mulloy'] output is T.M., input as ['Carlene Garrard'] output is C.G., input as ['Melodi Chism'] output is M.C., input as ['Bess Chilcott'] output is B.C., input as ['Chong Aylward'] output is C.A., input as ['Jani Ramthun'] output is J.R., input as ['Jacquiline Heintz'] output is J.H., input as ['Hayley Marquess'] output is H.M., input as ['Andria Spagnoli'] output is A.S., input as ['Irwin Covelli'] output is I.C., input as ['Gertude Montiel'] output is G.M., input as ['Stefany Reily'] output is S.R., input as ['Rae Mcgaughey'] output is R.M., input as ['Cruz Latimore'] output is C.L., input as ['Maryann Casler'] output is M.C., input as ['Annalisa Gregori'] output is A.G., input as ['Jenee Pannell'] output is J.P., , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
