Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Input Column Summary:

The input data consists of strings that combine a brand name with a numerical value, without any separation. The brand names observed in the dataset are "Ducati" and "Honda." The numerical values appended to these brand names vary and include 100, 125, 250, and 550. These strings appear to represent models of motorcycles or products associated with the brands, where the numerical part could potentially indicate a model number, engine capacity, or another product-specific identifier. However, the exact significance of the numbers is not clarified within the provided data.

### Output Column Summary:

The output data extracts and presents only the brand name portion from the input strings, effectively removing the numerical values. The output consists solely of the brand names "Ducati" and "Honda," which are derived directly from the input strings. This process of extraction suggests a focus on categorizing or identifying the products by their brand names, disregarding the numerical values that might represent specific models or product characteristics.

### Relationship Summary:

The relationship between the input and output data is a process of extraction and simplification, where the input strings, composed of both textual (brand names) and numerical components, are simplified to retain only the textual brand name components in the output. This transformation indicates a filtering process where the brand identity is deemed relevant, and the numerical identifiers are considered extraneous for the purpose of the output. The procedure suggests an analysis or categorization effort that prioritizes brand recognition over model-specific or numerical distinctions. This could be useful in contexts where the overarching brand identity is more significant than the specific models or variations within the brand's product lineup., and input as ['Ducati100'] output is Ducati, input as ['Honda125'] output is Honda, input as ['Ducati250'] output is Ducati, input as ['Honda250'] output is Honda, input as ['Honda550'] output is Honda, input as ['Ducati125'] output is Ducati, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
