Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Input Column Summary:

The input data consists of strings that are a combination of a brand name followed by a numeric value. The brand names observed in the dataset are "Ducati" and "Honda." The numeric values that follow the brand names are 100, 125, 250, and 550. These numbers seem to represent a model or specification related to the brand, possibly indicating different models or versions within the brand's lineup. Each input string is unique, combining one of the mentioned brand names with one of the numeric values, without any repetition of the exact same string.

### Output Column Summary:

The output data extracted from the input strings consists solely of the brand names, which are "Ducati" and "Honda." This indicates that the output is focused on identifying the brand component of the input data, disregarding the numeric values that follow the brand names in the input strings. The output is categorical, with each entry belonging to one of the two mentioned categories (Ducati or Honda).

### Relationship Summary:

The relationship between the input and output data is straightforward: the output is derived by isolating the brand name component from the input strings, effectively removing the numeric values that follow the brand names. This process transforms a mixed data type (alphanumeric) into a purely qualitative one (textual brand names), focusing on the categorical aspect of the input data. The numeric values in the input, despite their variance, do not influence the categorization in the output; the categorization is solely based on the brand name present in each input string. This indicates a clear, consistent rule for generating the output from the input: extract the brand name, irrespective of the model or specification number that follows it., and input as ['Ducati100'] output is Ducati, input as ['Honda125'] output is Honda, input as ['Ducati250'] output is Ducati, input as ['Honda250'] output is Honda, input as ['Honda550'] output is Honda, input as ['Ducati125'] output is Ducati, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
