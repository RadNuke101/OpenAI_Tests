Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Input Column Summary:

The input data consists of strings that are a combination of a brand name followed by a numeric value, with no spaces in between. The brand names observed in the dataset are "Ducati" and "Honda." The numeric values following the brand names are 100, 125, 250, and 550. These numbers seem to represent a model or specification related to the brand, possibly indicating different models or versions of motorcycles produced by these brands. The input data does not vary in structure, maintaining a consistent pattern of brand name followed by a numeric value.

### Output Column Summary:

The output data extracted from the input strings consists solely of the brand names "Ducati" and "Honda." This indicates that the process or function applied to the input data extracts or isolates the brand name from the combined string, disregarding the numeric value that follows the brand name in the input.

### Relationship Summary:

The relationship between the input and output data is a transformation process where the input strings, which are combinations of brand names and numeric values, are processed to extract only the brand names as output. This suggests that the numeric values, despite varying across the inputs, do not influence the output, which consistently represents the brand name part of the input string. The process effectively separates the qualitative component (brand name) from the mixed-format input, disregarding the quantitative component (numeric value) for the output. This relationship highlights a filtering or parsing operation where the focus is on identifying and extracting the brand component from a structured string format., and input as ['Ducati100'] output is Ducati, input as ['Honda125'] output is Honda, input as ['Ducati250'] output is Ducati, input as ['Honda250'] output is Honda, input as ['Honda550'] output is Honda, input as ['Ducati125'] output is Ducati, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
