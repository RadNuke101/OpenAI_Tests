Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Input Column Summary:

The input data consists of strings that are a mix of alphabetic characters and numeric digits. Each entry in the input column is a single string that does not follow a clear, uniform pattern in terms of the arrangement of characters and digits. The strings vary in length and composition, with no immediately apparent rule governing the inclusion or arrangement of alphabetic versus numeric characters. The examples provided, such as 'dhfjd9999999dfda' and 'ddsss999dfdfsfd', suggest that the strings are alphanumeric with a significant variation in the number of consecutive numeric characters present.

### Output Column Summary:

The output data is binary, represented as boolean values true or false. Each entry in the output column corresponds to a single input string and indicates a condition or a set of conditions that the input string either meets (true) or does not meet (false). The output does not vary in type; it strictly adheres to a binary classification based on the characteristics of the input string.

### Relationship Summary:

The relationship between the input and output columns appears to be based on a specific characteristic or set of characteristics of the input strings that determines the output value. Given the examples provided:

- For the input 'dhfjd9999999dfda', the output is true.
- For the input 'ddsss999dfdfsfd', the output is false.

It suggests that the determining factor for the output could be related to the presence and possibly the quantity of numeric characters within the string. Specifically, the output might be true if the string contains a certain number or sequence of numeric characters that meet a predefined criterion (e.g., a specific number of consecutive digits). Conversely, the output is false if the string does not meet this criterion.

The exact nature of the criterion (e.g., the required number of consecutive digits) is not explicitly stated but can be inferred to involve the presence of a significant sequence of numeric characters, as seen in the first example. The relationship, therefore, hinges on the qualitative analysis of the input strings, focusing on the presence, sequence, and possibly the count of numeric characters within the alphanumeric mix., and input as ['dhfjd9999999dfda'] output is true, input as ['ddsss999dfdfsfd'] output is false, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
