Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Input Column Summary:

The input data consists of a single column containing strings that are a mix of alphabetic characters and numeric digits. Each entry in this column is a unique combination of these characters, where the order and the specific characters used vary from one entry to another. The strings do not follow a consistent pattern in terms of length, the distribution of letters versus numbers, or the placement of these characters within the string. The data is qualitative in nature, representing a collection of alphanumeric sequences without inherent numerical value or categorical classification beyond their literal string value.

### Output Column Summary:

The output data is binary, consisting of boolean values: true or false. This binary output represents a classification based on some criteria applied to the input strings. The entire output column, therefore, categorizes the input strings into two distinct groups based on the unspecified criteria derived from the characteristics of each input string.

### Relationship Summary:

The relationship between the input and output columns suggests that the output classification (true or false) is determined by a specific characteristic or pattern within the input strings. Given the examples:

- Input: 'dhfjd9999999dfda' => Output: true
- Input: 'ddsss999dfdfsfd' => Output: false

It can be inferred that the presence, absence, or specific arrangement of alphanumeric characters within each input string influences the output classification. The exact nature of this relationship is not explicitly defined by the provided examples, but it may involve factors such as the number of consecutive numeric digits, the total count of numeric digits, the arrangement of characters, or other patterns within the strings that are not immediately apparent.

The summary of the relationship, therefore, is that the output boolean value is determined by applying a set of criteria or rules to the qualitative characteristics of the input strings. These criteria are related to the patterns, sequences, or specific arrangements of characters within the strings, which classify the inputs into two categories as represented by the true or false outputs., and input as ['dhfjd9999999dfda'] output is true, input as ['ddsss999dfdfsfd'] output is false, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
