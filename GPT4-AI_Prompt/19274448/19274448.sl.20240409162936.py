Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Input Column Summary:

The input data consists of a single column containing strings. These strings are a mix of alphabetic characters (both lowercase and uppercase) and numeric characters. The strings vary in length and composition, but all seem to follow a pattern where alphabetic and numeric characters are intermixed without a clear, consistent structure across the dataset. The presence of numeric characters within these strings is notable, with some strings containing a long sequence of consecutive numeric characters.

### Output Column Summary:

The output data is binary, represented as boolean values `true` or `false`. Each output value corresponds to an input string, indicating a certain condition or characteristic of the input string that either meets (`true`) or does not meet (`false`) a specific criterion.

### Relationship Summary:

The relationship between the input strings and the output boolean values appears to be based on the presence and possibly the arrangement of numeric characters within the input strings. Specifically, the criterion for an output to be `true` seems to involve having a long sequence of consecutive numeric characters within the input string. For instance, the input `['dhfjd9999999dfda']` leads to an output of `true`, likely due to the presence of a long sequence of '9's. On the other hand, the input `['ddsss999dfdfsfd']`, which contains fewer consecutive numeric characters, results in an output of `false`.

This suggests that the determining factor for the output value is not merely the presence of numeric characters but rather the presence of a specific length of consecutive numeric characters within the string. The exact threshold for the number of consecutive numeric characters required to flip the output from `false` to `true` is not explicitly provided but can be inferred to be a critical part of the underlying logic connecting the input to the output., and input as ['dhfjd9999999dfda'] output is true, input as ['ddsss999dfdfsfd'] output is false, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
