Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Input Column Summary:

The input data consists of a single column containing strings. These strings are a mix of alphabetic characters (both lowercase and uppercase) and numeric digits. The strings do not follow a fixed pattern in terms of length, character types (letters or numbers), or their arrangement. However, they seem to be alphanumeric, with a significant presence of numeric characters embedded within the letters. The examples provided, such as 'dhfjd9999999dfda' and 'ddsss999dfdfsfd', suggest that the strings could vary widely in their composition, with no clear rule governing the sequence or proportion of letters to numbers.

### Output Column Summary:

The output data is binary, represented as boolean values true or false. This binary nature indicates a classification task, where each input string is evaluated against a certain criterion or set of criteria to determine its classification. The output for the given examples suggests that the classification is directly related to the characteristics of the input strings, possibly based on the presence, absence, or arrangement of certain patterns within these strings.

### Relationship Summary:

The relationship between the input strings and the output classification seems to hinge on specific characteristics or patterns within the strings. Given the examples:

- Input: 'dhfjd9999999dfda' => Output: true
- Input: 'ddsss999dfdfsfd' => Output: false

It can be inferred that the presence of a long sequence of consecutive numeric digits within a string might be a key factor influencing the output classification. In the first example, a long sequence of '9's results in a true output, suggesting that the criterion for a true classification could involve having a certain number of consecutive numeric digits. The second example, with fewer consecutive digits, results in a false output, reinforcing this hypothesis.

However, without more examples or explicit rules, this relationship is speculative. Other factors, such as the total number of digits, the specific digits present, the presence of certain letter sequences, or even the overall length of the string, could also play roles in determining the output classification. The true nature of the relationship depends on the underlying rules or patterns that the classification algorithm or criteria are designed to detect., and input as ['dhfjd9999999dfda'] output is true, input as ['ddsss999dfdfsfd'] output is false, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
