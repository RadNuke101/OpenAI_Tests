Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Summary of Input Column Data

The input data consists of strings that represent phone numbers in an international format. Each entry begins with a '+' sign, followed by the country code, a space, and then the local number divided into three groups by hyphens. The country codes vary in length, ranging from one to three digits. The local numbers are consistently divided into three groups, with each group separated by a hyphen. The format of the local numbers is consistent across all entries, suggesting a standardized method of representing phone numbers. The presence of the '+' sign indicates an international dialing format, which is commonly used in global communications to specify the country code before the local number.

### Summary of Output Column Data

The output data transforms the input phone numbers into a different format. The transformation involves removing the space and hyphens from the input and replacing them with periods. The country code and the local number groups are separated by periods, maintaining the distinction between the country code and the local number segments. This format retains the original components of the phone number (country code and local number groups) but changes the separators to create a uniform and consistent representation across all entries. The output format does not include the '+' sign, focusing solely on the numeric parts of the phone numbers and their new separators.

### Relationship Between Input and Output

The transformation from the input to the output data involves a systematic alteration of the separators within the phone numbers. The process can be summarized as follows:

1. **Removal of the '+' Sign**: The initial '+' sign indicating international dialing is removed in the output, focusing the transformation on the numeric parts of the phone numbers.

2. **Separator Replacement**: The space after the country code and the hyphens separating the local number groups in the input are replaced with periods in the output. This change standardizes the format across all entries, making it consistent and potentially easier to parse or process for certain applications.

3. **Retention of Number Groups**: The country code and the three groups of the local number are retained in their original order, ensuring that the essential structure and information of the phone number are preserved.

The relationship between the input and output data highlights a methodical approach to reformatting phone numbers, potentially aimed at standardizing the representation for easier processing, storage, or display in systems that require a uniform format. This transformation could be particularly useful in databases, communication applications, or any context where a consistent and simplified representation of international phone numbers is beneficial., and input as ['+106 769-858-438'] output is 106.769.858.438, input as ['+83 973-757-831'] output is 83.973.757.831, input as ['+62 647-787-775'] output is 62.647.787.775, input as ['+172 027-507-632'] output is 172.027.507.632, input as ['+72 001-050-856'] output is 72.001.050.856, input as ['+95 310-537-401'] output is 95.310.537.401, input as ['+6 775-969-238'] output is 6.775.969.238, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
