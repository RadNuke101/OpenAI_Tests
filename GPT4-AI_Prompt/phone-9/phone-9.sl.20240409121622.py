Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Input Column Summary:

The input data consists of strings that represent phone numbers in a specific format. Each string begins with a plus sign ('+') followed by a country code, a space, and then the phone number itself divided into three groups by hyphens ('-'). The country codes vary in length, ranging from one to three digits, indicating that the phone numbers belong to various countries. The phone numbers are consistently formatted into three groups, separated by hyphens, suggesting a standardized way of representing these numbers, possibly for readability or to adhere to a specific data entry standard.

### Output Column Summary:

The output data transforms the format of the phone numbers provided in the input. The transformation involves removing the space after the country code and replacing the hyphens with periods ('.'). This results in a continuous string of digits that retains the country code and the phone number but changes the separators for a different visual representation. The output format emphasizes a more unified approach to displaying the phone numbers, possibly for consistency in a database, a different standard of data representation, or to align with a specific system's requirements for phone number formatting.

### Relationship Summary:

The transformation from the input to the output column represents a standardized process of reformatting phone numbers from one visual representation to another. The key steps in this transformation include:

1. **Removing the space** after the country code, which initially serves to separate the country code from the rest of the phone number in the input.
2. **Replacing hyphens with periods**, changing the visual separator between the groups of numbers within the phone number.

This process suggests an intention to maintain the integrity and components of the original phone number while adapting its format to meet a different standard or requirement. The consistent application of these transformation rules across various phone numbers, regardless of their country code or the specific digits, indicates a systematic approach to data formatting, likely aimed at achieving uniformity and possibly improving compatibility with a particular system or standard that prefers or requires this specific format., and input as ['+106 769-858-438'] output is 106.769.858.438, input as ['+83 973-757-831'] output is 83.973.757.831, input as ['+62 647-787-775'] output is 62.647.787.775, input as ['+172 027-507-632'] output is 172.027.507.632, input as ['+72 001-050-856'] output is 72.001.050.856, input as ['+95 310-537-401'] output is 95.310.537.401, input as ['+6 775-969-238'] output is 6.775.969.238, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
