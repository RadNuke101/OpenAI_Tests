Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Input Column Summary:

The input data consists of two columns, each row representing a specific educational institution in the United States. The first column includes the name of the university or college, which varies from well-known abbreviations (e.g., UCLA, MIT, NYU) to full names (e.g., University of Pennsylvania, Harvard University). These names cover a broad spectrum of prestigious institutions across the country, indicating a focus on higher education entities.

The second column provides the geographical location of each institution, typically formatted as "City, State" or "City, State, USA". Some entries include common abbreviations for states (e.g., CA for California, NY for New York), while others spell out the state name in full. A few entries include a more detailed address by adding "USA" at the end, although this is not consistent across all entries.

### Output Column Summary:

The output data harmonizes the geographical information provided in the input while ensuring a standardized format across all entries. The transformation process seems to focus on achieving a uniform representation of each institution's location by:

1. Correcting state abbreviations to a consistent format when necessary (e.g., "New York" to "NY").
2. Adding "USA" to the end of each entry to standardize the geographical reference to the United States, ensuring clarity for an international audience.
3. Maintaining the city and state information as provided in the input, with minor corrections to spelling errors (e.g., "Phialdelphia" corrected to "Philadelphia").
4. In cases where the university name is included with the city and state in the input (e.g., "UCLA, Los Angeles, CA"), the output retains this format and appends ", USA" to ensure geographical clarity.

### Relationship Between Input and Output:

The transformation from input to output demonstrates a process of standardization and correction aimed at creating a uniform representation of university locations within the United States. This process respects the original geographical information while making adjustments for consistency, clarity, and international understanding. The output ensures that each entry is immediately recognizable and understandable, emphasizing the geographical context of each institution within the broader scope of the United States. This transformation is particularly useful for databases, directories, or any application where standardized location information is crucial., and input as ['UC Berkeley', 'Berkeley, CA'] output is Berkeley, CA, USA, input as ['University of Pennsylvania', 'Phialdelphia, PA, USA'] output is Phialdelphia, PA, USA, input as ['UCLA', 'Los Angeles, CA'] output is UCLA, Los Angeles, CA, USA, input as ['Cornell University', 'Ithaca, New York, USA'] output is Ithaca, NY, USA, input as ['Penn', 'Philadelphia, PA, USA'] output is Philadelphia, PA, USA, input as ['University of Michigan', 'Ann Arbor, MI, USA'] output is Ann Arbor, MI, USA, input as ['UC Berkeley', 'Berkeley, CA'] output is Berkeley, CA, USA, input as ['MIT', 'Cambridge, MA'] output is Cambridge, MA, USA, input as ['University of Pennsylvania', 'Phialdelphia, PA, USA'] output is Phialdelphia, PA, USA, input as ['UCLA', 'Los Angeles, CA'] output is Los Angeles, CA, USA, input as ['University of Maryland College Park', 'College Park, MD'] output is College Park, MD, USA, input as ['University of Michigan', 'Ann Arbor, MI, USA'] output is Ann Arbor, MI, USA, input as ['UC Berkeley', 'Berkeley, CA'] output is Berkeley, CA, USA, input as ['MIT', 'Cambridge, MA'] output is Cambridge, MA, USA, input as ['Rice University', 'Houston, TX'] output is Houston, TX, USA, input as ['Yale University', 'New Haven, CT, USA'] output is New Haven, CT, USA, input as ['Columbia University', 'New York, NY, USA'] output is New York, NY, USA, input as ['NYU', 'New York, New York, USA'] output is New York, NY, USA, input as ['Drexel University', 'Philadelphia, PA'] output is Philadelphia, PA, USA, input as ['UC Berkeley', 'Berkeley, CA'] output is Berkeley, CA, USA, input as ['UIUC', 'Urbana, IL'] output is Urbana, IL, USA, input as ['Temple University', 'Philadelphia, PA'] output is Philadelphia, PA, USA, input as ['Harvard University', 'Cambridge, MA, USA'] output is Cambridge, MA, USA, input as ['University of Connecticut', 'Storrs, CT, USA'] output is Storrs, CT, USA, input as ['Drexel University', 'Philadelphia, PA'] output is DPhiladelphia, PA, USA, input as ['NYU', 'New York, New York, USA'] output is New York, NY, USA, input as ['UIUC', 'Urbana, IL'] output is Urbana, IL, USA, input as ['New Haven University', 'New Haven, CT, USA'] output is New Haven, CT, USA, input as ['University of California, Santa Barbara', 'Santa Barbara, CA, USA'] output is Santa Barbara, CA, USA, input as ['University of Connecticut', 'Storrs, CT, USA'] output is Storrs, CT, USA, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
