Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Input Column Summary:

The input data consists of two columns, each containing strings. The first column lists names of universities or colleges, which include a mix of full names (e.g., "University of Pennsylvania") and abbreviations or informal names (e.g., "UCLA", "Penn", "NYU"). These names represent a variety of institutions across the United States, indicating a broad geographic coverage. The second column provides the corresponding locations of these institutions, formatted as city and state, with some entries also including the country ("USA"). The format of the locations varies, including different levels of detail (e.g., "Berkeley, CA" vs. "Ithaca, New York, USA"). This column reflects a mix of specificity in how locations are described, from concise city-state formats to more detailed ones that include the country.

### Output Column Summary:

The output data is a standardized format of the locations associated with the universities and colleges mentioned in the input data. Each output string is formatted consistently as "City, State Abbreviation, USA", ensuring uniformity across entries. This standardization process involves correcting inconsistencies found in the input data, such as varying levels of detail (adding "USA" where it's missing, standardizing state names to abbreviations) and correcting minor errors (e.g., "Phialdelphia" to "Philadelphia"). The output does not include the names of the institutions, focusing solely on their locations. This approach simplifies and unifies the location information, making it more straightforward and consistent for any potential use or analysis.

### Relationship Summary:

The transformation from input to output data demonstrates a process of standardization and correction of location information associated with various universities and colleges across the United States. The input data's two-column format, which pairs institution names with their locations, is streamlined in the output to focus exclusively on a uniform representation of those locations. This process involves adding missing information (e.g., "USA"), standardizing state representations to their abbreviations, and correcting typographical errors. The relationship between the input and output underscores an effort to create a consistent and error-free dataset of university and college locations, which could be beneficial for mapping, analysis, or any context where uniform location data is required., and input as ['UC Berkeley', 'Berkeley, CA'] output is Berkeley, CA, USA, input as ['University of Pennsylvania', 'Phialdelphia, PA, USA'] output is Phialdelphia, PA, USA, input as ['UCLA', 'Los Angeles, CA'] output is UCLA, Los Angeles, CA, USA, input as ['Cornell University', 'Ithaca, New York, USA'] output is Ithaca, NY, USA, input as ['Penn', 'Philadelphia, PA, USA'] output is Philadelphia, PA, USA, input as ['University of Michigan', 'Ann Arbor, MI, USA'] output is Ann Arbor, MI, USA, input as ['UC Berkeley', 'Berkeley, CA'] output is Berkeley, CA, USA, input as ['MIT', 'Cambridge, MA'] output is Cambridge, MA, USA, input as ['University of Pennsylvania', 'Phialdelphia, PA, USA'] output is Phialdelphia, PA, USA, input as ['UCLA', 'Los Angeles, CA'] output is Los Angeles, CA, USA, input as ['University of Maryland College Park', 'College Park, MD'] output is College Park, MD, USA, input as ['University of Michigan', 'Ann Arbor, MI, USA'] output is Ann Arbor, MI, USA, input as ['UC Berkeley', 'Berkeley, CA'] output is Berkeley, CA, USA, input as ['MIT', 'Cambridge, MA'] output is Cambridge, MA, USA, input as ['Rice University', 'Houston, TX'] output is Houston, TX, USA, input as ['Yale University', 'New Haven, CT, USA'] output is New Haven, CT, USA, input as ['Columbia University', 'New York, NY, USA'] output is New York, NY, USA, input as ['NYU', 'New York, New York, USA'] output is New York, NY, USA, input as ['Drexel University', 'Philadelphia, PA'] output is Philadelphia, PA, USA, input as ['UC Berkeley', 'Berkeley, CA'] output is Berkeley, CA, USA, input as ['UIUC', 'Urbana, IL'] output is Urbana, IL, USA, input as ['Temple University', 'Philadelphia, PA'] output is Philadelphia, PA, USA, input as ['Harvard University', 'Cambridge, MA, USA'] output is Cambridge, MA, USA, input as ['University of Connecticut', 'Storrs, CT, USA'] output is Storrs, CT, USA, input as ['Drexel University', 'Philadelphia, PA'] output is DPhiladelphia, PA, USA, input as ['NYU', 'New York, New York, USA'] output is New York, NY, USA, input as ['UIUC', 'Urbana, IL'] output is Urbana, IL, USA, input as ['New Haven University', 'New Haven, CT, USA'] output is New Haven, CT, USA, input as ['University of California, Santa Barbara', 'Santa Barbara, CA, USA'] output is Santa Barbara, CA, USA, input as ['University of Connecticut', 'Storrs, CT, USA'] output is Storrs, CT, USA, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
