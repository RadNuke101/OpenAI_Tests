Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Input Column Summary:

The input data consists of two columns, each containing information related to various universities and colleges primarily in the United States. The first column specifies the name of the institution, which includes a mix of full names (e.g., "University of Pennsylvania") and abbreviations or informal names (e.g., "UCLA" for University of California, Los Angeles). This variety indicates a recognition of institutions by both their formal and colloquial identifiers. The second column provides the location of these institutions, including the city and state. In some cases, the country is also mentioned (e.g., "USA"), though it's predominantly implied to be the United States given the state abbreviations. The locations are presented with varying levels of detail, from just the city and state to full addresses that include the country. This input data reflects a diverse range of higher education institutions across different states, showcasing the geographical spread and variety of higher education options available in the USA.

### Output Column Summary:

The output data standardizes the format of the location information provided in the input, ensuring consistency across all entries. Each output entry includes the city, the state abbreviation, and the country ("USA"), even if the original input did not explicitly mention the country. This standardization process simplifies the location data, making it more uniform and easier to understand at a glance. The output corrects any inconsistencies in state naming conventions by using the two-letter state abbreviations and ensures the country is always mentioned, enhancing clarity for an international audience. Additionally, for institutions recognized by their abbreviations or informal names (e.g., "UCLA"), the output retains these identifiers along with the standardized location format, acknowledging the common usage and recognition of these names. The process of generating the output demonstrates an effort to create a uniform representation of location data for educational institutions, facilitating easier comparison and identification.

### Relationship Summary:

The transformation from input to output data illustrates a process of standardization and simplification of location information for higher education institutions. The relationship between the input and output underscores an effort to maintain the recognizable identity of each institution (whether through formal names or widely used abbreviations) while ensuring that the location data adheres to a consistent and simplified format. This standardization includes the correction of city names to their common forms, the use of two-letter state abbreviations, and the addition of the country name "USA" to all entries. The output facilitates a clearer, more accessible presentation of location information, which can be particularly useful for audiences unfamiliar with the varied naming conventions and levels of detail originally presented in the input data. This process reflects an understanding of the importance of both recognizing institutions as they are commonly known and providing location information in a universally understandable format., and input as ['UC Berkeley', 'Berkeley, CA'] output is Berkeley, CA, USA, input as ['University of Pennsylvania', 'Phialdelphia, PA, USA'] output is Phialdelphia, PA, USA, input as ['UCLA', 'Los Angeles, CA'] output is UCLA, Los Angeles, CA, USA, input as ['Cornell University', 'Ithaca, New York, USA'] output is Ithaca, NY, USA, input as ['Penn', 'Philadelphia, PA, USA'] output is Philadelphia, PA, USA, input as ['University of Michigan', 'Ann Arbor, MI, USA'] output is Ann Arbor, MI, USA, input as ['UC Berkeley', 'Berkeley, CA'] output is Berkeley, CA, USA, input as ['MIT', 'Cambridge, MA'] output is Cambridge, MA, USA, input as ['University of Pennsylvania', 'Phialdelphia, PA, USA'] output is Phialdelphia, PA, USA, input as ['UCLA', 'Los Angeles, CA'] output is Los Angeles, CA, USA, input as ['University of Maryland College Park', 'College Park, MD'] output is College Park, MD, USA, input as ['University of Michigan', 'Ann Arbor, MI, USA'] output is Ann Arbor, MI, USA, input as ['UC Berkeley', 'Berkeley, CA'] output is Berkeley, CA, USA, input as ['MIT', 'Cambridge, MA'] output is Cambridge, MA, USA, input as ['Rice University', 'Houston, TX'] output is Houston, TX, USA, input as ['Yale University', 'New Haven, CT, USA'] output is New Haven, CT, USA, input as ['Columbia University', 'New York, NY, USA'] output is New York, NY, USA, input as ['NYU', 'New York, New York, USA'] output is New York, NY, USA, input as ['Drexel University', 'Philadelphia, PA'] output is Philadelphia, PA, USA, input as ['UC Berkeley', 'Berkeley, CA'] output is Berkeley, CA, USA, input as ['UIUC', 'Urbana, IL'] output is Urbana, IL, USA, input as ['Temple University', 'Philadelphia, PA'] output is Philadelphia, PA, USA, input as ['Harvard University', 'Cambridge, MA, USA'] output is Cambridge, MA, USA, input as ['University of Connecticut', 'Storrs, CT, USA'] output is Storrs, CT, USA, input as ['Drexel University', 'Philadelphia, PA'] output is DPhiladelphia, PA, USA, input as ['NYU', 'New York, New York, USA'] output is New York, NY, USA, input as ['UIUC', 'Urbana, IL'] output is Urbana, IL, USA, input as ['New Haven University', 'New Haven, CT, USA'] output is New Haven, CT, USA, input as ['University of California, Santa Barbara', 'Santa Barbara, CA, USA'] output is Santa Barbara, CA, USA, input as ['University of Connecticut', 'Storrs, CT, USA'] output is Storrs, CT, USA, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
