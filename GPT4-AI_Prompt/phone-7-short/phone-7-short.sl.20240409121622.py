Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Summary of Input Column Data

The input data consists of strings formatted as phone numbers with an international dialing code prefix. Each string follows a consistent pattern characterized by:

1. **International Dialing Code**: A "+" sign followed by a variable number of digits (ranging from one to three digits in the examples provided). This code represents the country or region of the phone number.
2. **Space Separator**: After the international dialing code, there is a space that separates it from the rest of the phone number.
3. **Phone Number**: The phone number itself is divided into three groups by hyphens. The first group varies in length (three or four digits), while the second and third groups consistently contain three digits each.

The input data showcases a variety of international dialing codes, indicating a global dataset. The phone numbers follow a structured format, but the specific numbers appear to be arbitrary or randomly generated for the purpose of this example.

### Summary of Output Column Data

The output data consists of three-digit numbers extracted from the input strings. Specifically, these numbers are always the second group of digits from the phone number part of the input string, following the first hyphen and preceding the second hyphen. 

### Relationship Between Input and Output

The relationship between the input and output data is a straightforward extraction process where the output is derived directly from a specific portion of the input data. The output consistently represents the middle segment of the phone number, regardless of the international dialing code or the specific numbers involved. This extraction process ignores the international dialing code and the first and last segments of the phone number, focusing solely on the middle group of digits.

This consistent pattern suggests that the middle segment of these formatted phone numbers holds particular significance or interest for the context in which this data is being analyzed. The extraction process treats the input data qualitatively, focusing on the structure of the data rather than any quantitative value the numbers might represent., and input as ['+106 769-858-438'] output is 858, input as ['+83 973-757-831'] output is 757, input as ['+62 647-787-775'] output is 787, input as ['+172 027-507-632'] output is 507, input as ['+72 001-050-856'] output is 050, input as ['+95 310-537-401'] output is 537, input as ['+6 775-969-238'] output is 969, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
