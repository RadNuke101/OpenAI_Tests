Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Summary of Input Column Data:

The input data consists of strings formatted as phone numbers with a distinctive pattern. Each string begins with a country code prefixed with a plus sign (+), followed by a space, and then a sequence of three groups of digits separated by hyphens. The first group after the country code varies in length, possibly reflecting different country code lengths or area codes. The second and third groups of digits are consistently separated by hyphens. This format suggests a standardized way of representing phone numbers internationally, with variations in the first group of digits after the country code possibly indicating different regional formats or operator codes.

### Summary of Output Column Data:

The output data extracts a specific segment from each input string, specifically the second group of digits found between the first and second hyphens. This segment varies in length and numerical value across the dataset but consistently represents the middle portion of the phone number. The extraction of this segment suggests a focus on a part of the phone number that might hold specific significance, such as an area or operator code that could be of interest for the analysis or application at hand.

### Relationship Between Input and Output:

The relationship between the input and output data is characterized by the extraction process where the output is consistently the second group of digits from the input phone number. This process ignores the country code and the first and last groups of digits, focusing solely on the middle segment. The consistent extraction of this segment across various phone numbers, regardless of their country code or the length of other segments, indicates a systematic approach to isolating a particular part of the phone number. This could imply that the middle segment holds specific importance, such as identifying a particular region, operator, or type of service within the broader context of the phone number. The methodology does not account for the numerical value of the extracted segment but rather its positional significance within the standardized phone number format., and input as ['+106 769-858-438'] output is 858, input as ['+83 973-757-831'] output is 757, input as ['+62 647-787-775'] output is 787, input as ['+172 027-507-632'] output is 507, input as ['+72 001-050-856'] output is 050, input as ['+95 310-537-401'] output is 537, input as ['+6 775-969-238'] output is 969, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
