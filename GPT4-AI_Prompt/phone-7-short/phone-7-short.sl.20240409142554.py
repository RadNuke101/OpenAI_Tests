Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Summary of Input Column Data

The input data consists of strings that follow a specific format pattern: a plus sign (+) followed by a country code (one or more digits), a space, and a three-part phone number separated by hyphens. The three-part phone number format is consistent across all entries, represented as XXX-XXX-XXX, where each X is a digit from 0 to 9. The country code varies in length across different entries, indicating that the dataset might include international phone numbers from various countries. The presence of the plus sign suggests that these are in an international format, making them identifiable regardless of the user's location.

### Summary of Output Column Data

The output data consists of three-digit numbers extracted from the input strings. Specifically, these numbers are the middle segment of the three-part phone numbers from the input data. This segment is consistently positioned between the first and last hyphens in the input string. The output numbers range from 050 to 969, indicating a wide variety of middle segments. The output is treated as qualitative data, focusing on the pattern of extraction rather than the numerical value of the digits.

### Relationship Between Input and Output

The relationship between the input and output data is defined by a systematic extraction process where the output is always the middle segment of the phone number from the input string. This process ignores the country code and the first and last segments of the phone number, focusing solely on the middle part. The extraction process treats the input as qualitative data, meaning the significance lies in the pattern of the data rather than its numerical value. This relationship suggests a consistent method of data processing across the dataset, where the output serves as a specific identifier or key part of the input data, potentially useful for categorization, filtering, or further analysis based on the middle segment of the phone numbers., and input as ['+106 769-858-438'] output is 858, input as ['+83 973-757-831'] output is 757, input as ['+62 647-787-775'] output is 787, input as ['+172 027-507-632'] output is 507, input as ['+72 001-050-856'] output is 050, input as ['+95 310-537-401'] output is 537, input as ['+6 775-969-238'] output is 969, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
