Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Input Column Summary:

The input data consists of two columns. The first column contains the names of various universities and colleges, predominantly located in the United States. These institutions range from large, well-known universities such as "Harvard University" and "MIT" to more specialized or less nationally recognized institutions like "New Haven University." The names are presented in various formats, sometimes using abbreviations (e.g., "UCLA" for University of California, Los Angeles) or informal names (e.g., "Penn" for the University of Pennsylvania).

The second column provides the location of these institutions, including the city and state. In some cases, the country ("USA") is also included, while in others, it is omitted. The state names are sometimes abbreviated (e.g., "CA" for California), and in other instances, they are spelled out fully (e.g., "New York"). There are a few inconsistencies in the spelling of city names (e.g., "Phialdelphia" instead of "Philadelphia") and variations in how locations are presented (e.g., "New York, New York" vs. "New York, NY").

### Output Column Summary:

The output data standardizes the format of the locations associated with each institution from the input data. It consistently presents the city, state abbreviation, and country ("USA") for each institution, regardless of how the location was originally provided. The state names are uniformly abbreviated, and the country is always included to provide clarity and consistency. The output corrects any spelling errors observed in the input (e.g., "Phialdelphia" is corrected to "Philadelphia") and standardizes the presentation of locations to ensure a uniform format across all entries. This standardization facilitates easier recognition and comparison of the institutions' locations.

### Relationship Summary:

The transformation from the input columns to the output column involves several key processes: standardization of state names to their abbreviations, correction of spelling errors in city names, addition of the country name "USA" where it was omitted, and ensuring a consistent format across all entries. The relationship between the input and output highlights an effort to provide clear, concise, and standardized location information for each institution, making it easier to understand and compare the geographical distribution of these universities and colleges across the United States. This process underscores the importance of data consistency and accuracy in presenting qualitative information., and input as ['UC Berkeley', 'Berkeley, CA'] output is Berkeley, CA, USA, input as ['University of Pennsylvania', 'Phialdelphia, PA, USA'] output is Phialdelphia, PA, USA, input as ['Cornell University', 'Ithaca, New York, USA'] output is Ithaca, NY, USA, input as ['Penn', 'Philadelphia, PA, USA'] output is Philadelphia, PA, USA, input as ['University of Michigan', 'Ann Arbor, MI, USA'] output is Ann Arbor, MI, USA, input as ['UC Berkeley', 'Berkeley, CA'] output is Berkeley, CA, USA, input as ['MIT', 'Cambridge, MA'] output is Cambridge, MA, USA, input as ['University of Pennsylvania', 'Phialdelphia, PA, USA'] output is Phialdelphia, PA, USA, input as ['UCLA', 'Los Angeles, CA'] output is Los Angeles, CA, USA, input as ['University of Maryland College Park', 'College Park, MD'] output is College Park, MD, USA, input as ['University of Michigan', 'Ann Arbor, MI, USA'] output is Ann Arbor, MI, USA, input as ['UC Berkeley', 'Berkeley, CA'] output is Berkeley, CA, USA, input as ['MIT', 'Cambridge, MA'] output is Cambridge, MA, USA, input as ['Rice University', 'Houston, TX'] output is Houston, TX, USA, input as ['Yale University', 'New Haven, CT, USA'] output is New Haven, CT, USA, input as ['Columbia University', 'New York, NY, USA'] output is New York, NY, USA, input as ['NYU', 'New York, New York, USA'] output is New York, NY, USA, input as ['Drexel University', 'Philadelphia, PA'] output is Philadelphia, PA, USA, input as ['UC Berkeley', 'Berkeley, CA'] output is Berkeley, CA, USA, input as ['UIUC', 'Urbana, IL'] output is Urbana, IL, USA, input as ['Temple University', 'Philadelphia, PA'] output is Philadelphia, PA, USA, input as ['Harvard University', 'Cambridge, MA, USA'] output is Cambridge, MA, USA, input as ['University of Connecticut', 'Storrs, CT, USA'] output is Storrs, CT, USA, input as ['Drexel University', 'Philadelphia, PA'] output is Philadelphia, PA, USA, input as ['NYU', 'New York, New York, USA'] output is New York, NY, USA, input as ['UIUC', 'Urbana, IL'] output is Urbana, IL, USA, input as ['New Haven University', 'New Haven, CT, USA'] output is New Haven, CT, USA, input as ['University of California, Santa Barbara', 'Santa Barbara, CA, USA'] output is Santa Barbara, CA, USA, input as ['University of Connecticut', 'Storrs, CT, USA'] output is Storrs, CT, USA, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
