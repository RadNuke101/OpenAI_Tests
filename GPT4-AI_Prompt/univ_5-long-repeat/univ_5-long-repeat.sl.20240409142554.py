Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Input Column Summary:

The input data consists of two columns, each containing specific information related to various universities and colleges across the United States. The first column provides the name of the institution, which includes a mix of full university names (e.g., "University of Pennsylvania"), abbreviations (e.g., "MIT" for Massachusetts Institute of Technology), and informal names (e.g., "Penn" for the University of Pennsylvania). This variety indicates a broad representation of how institutions are referred to in both formal and colloquial contexts.

The second column specifies the location of each institution, given in a format that includes the city and state. In some instances, the state is abbreviated (e.g., "CA" for California), while in others, it is spelled out (e.g., "New York"). Additionally, some entries include the country ("USA"), whereas others do not, suggesting an assumption that the context is primarily within the United States unless otherwise noted.

### Output Column Summary:

The output data standardizes the information provided in the second input column, focusing on the location of each institution. It consistently formats the location as "City, State Abbreviation, USA," ensuring uniformity across entries. This standardization process includes correcting misspellings (e.g., "Phialdelphia" to "Philadelphia"), standardizing state abbreviations (e.g., "New York" to "NY"), and appending ", USA" to entries where the country was initially omitted. The output demonstrates a systematic approach to presenting location information in a concise and uniform manner, facilitating easier comprehension and comparison across entries.

### Relationship Summary:

The transformation from input to output columns reveals a process of standardization and correction aimed at achieving consistency in how university and college locations are presented. The input data's variety in naming conventions and location formats is streamlined in the output to adhere to a specific template. This process not only corrects minor errors but also ensures that each entry is presented in a format that is immediately recognizable and comparable. The relationship between the input and output underscores the importance of data normalization, especially when dealing with qualitative information that may initially lack uniformity. This standardization is crucial for enhancing clarity, improving data analysis, and facilitating communication., and input as ['UC Berkeley', 'Berkeley, CA'] output is Berkeley, CA, USA, input as ['University of Pennsylvania', 'Phialdelphia, PA, USA'] output is Phialdelphia, PA, USA, input as ['Cornell University', 'Ithaca, New York, USA'] output is Ithaca, NY, USA, input as ['Penn', 'Philadelphia, PA, USA'] output is Philadelphia, PA, USA, input as ['University of Michigan', 'Ann Arbor, MI, USA'] output is Ann Arbor, MI, USA, input as ['UC Berkeley', 'Berkeley, CA'] output is Berkeley, CA, USA, input as ['MIT', 'Cambridge, MA'] output is Cambridge, MA, USA, input as ['University of Pennsylvania', 'Phialdelphia, PA, USA'] output is Phialdelphia, PA, USA, input as ['UCLA', 'Los Angeles, CA'] output is Los Angeles, CA, USA, input as ['University of Maryland College Park', 'College Park, MD'] output is College Park, MD, USA, input as ['University of Michigan', 'Ann Arbor, MI, USA'] output is Ann Arbor, MI, USA, input as ['UC Berkeley', 'Berkeley, CA'] output is Berkeley, CA, USA, input as ['MIT', 'Cambridge, MA'] output is Cambridge, MA, USA, input as ['Rice University', 'Houston, TX'] output is Houston, TX, USA, input as ['Yale University', 'New Haven, CT, USA'] output is New Haven, CT, USA, input as ['Columbia University', 'New York, NY, USA'] output is New York, NY, USA, input as ['NYU', 'New York, New York, USA'] output is New York, NY, USA, input as ['Drexel University', 'Philadelphia, PA'] output is Philadelphia, PA, USA, input as ['UC Berkeley', 'Berkeley, CA'] output is Berkeley, CA, USA, input as ['UIUC', 'Urbana, IL'] output is Urbana, IL, USA, input as ['Temple University', 'Philadelphia, PA'] output is Philadelphia, PA, USA, input as ['Harvard University', 'Cambridge, MA, USA'] output is Cambridge, MA, USA, input as ['University of Connecticut', 'Storrs, CT, USA'] output is Storrs, CT, USA, input as ['Drexel University', 'Philadelphia, PA'] output is Philadelphia, PA, USA, input as ['NYU', 'New York, New York, USA'] output is New York, NY, USA, input as ['UIUC', 'Urbana, IL'] output is Urbana, IL, USA, input as ['New Haven University', 'New Haven, CT, USA'] output is New Haven, CT, USA, input as ['University of California, Santa Barbara', 'Santa Barbara, CA, USA'] output is Santa Barbara, CA, USA, input as ['University of Connecticut', 'Storrs, CT, USA'] output is Storrs, CT, USA, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
