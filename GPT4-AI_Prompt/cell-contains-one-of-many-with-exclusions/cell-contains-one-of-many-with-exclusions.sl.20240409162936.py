Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Input Column Summary:

The input data consists of four columns. The first column contains phrases describing objects with specific colors and sometimes additional descriptive elements (e.g., "yellow dog on green grass"). The subsequent three columns list individual words, which appear to be color names or descriptive elements (e.g., "yellow", "green", "neon").

1. **First Column (Phrases):** Descriptions of various items or scenes, emphasizing colors and sometimes additional attributes.
2. **Second Column (First Keyword):** Primarily color names, which seem to be a key descriptor intended for matching or comparison with the first column.
3. **Third Column (Second Keyword):** Also mainly color names, serving a similar purpose as the second column for matching or comparison.
4. **Fourth Column (Third Keyword):** Contains both color names and other descriptive words, indicating a broader range of attributes for comparison.

### Output Column Summary:

The output data is binary (true or false), indicating whether there is a specific relationship or match between the input phrases and the keywords listed in the subsequent columns.

### Relationship Summary:

The output (true or false) appears to be determined by the presence or absence of the keywords listed in the second, third, and fourth columns within the phrase described in the first column. Specifically, the output is **true** if at least one of the keywords from the second and third columns is found in the first column's phrase, and if either the fourth column's keyword is present in the phrase or if the specific condition of matching is not strictly required for the fourth keyword. Conversely, the output is **false** when these conditions are not met, particularly when neither of the keywords from the second and third columns is found in the phrase, or the fourth column's keyword's presence or absence does not align with the required matching criteria.

In summary, the relationship between the input and output hinges on the matching of keywords (colors and descriptive elements) from the second, third, and fourth columns with the phrases in the first column, underlining the importance of these keywords in determining the output's truth value., and input as ['yellow dog on green grass', 'yellow', 'green', 'cat'] output is true, input as ['warm gray sweater', 'yellow', 'green', 'cat'] output is false, input as ['blue neon signs', 'blue', 'green', 'neon'] output is false, input as ['hot pink socks', 'blue', 'pink', 'neon'] output is true, input as ['deep black eyes', 'yellow', 'green', 'neon'] output is false, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
