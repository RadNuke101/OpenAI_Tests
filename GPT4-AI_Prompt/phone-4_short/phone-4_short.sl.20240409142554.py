Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Summary of Input Column Data:

The input data consists of a series of strings formatted as three groups of three digits each, separated by hyphens. Each string appears to represent a unique identifier or code, with no immediately discernible pattern or sequence. The groups of digits range from 000 to 999, but without access to the entire dataset, it's not possible to determine the full range or distribution of values. The format is consistent across all entries, adhering to the pattern "XXX-XXX-XXX".

### Summary of Output Column Data:

The output data maintains the same numerical values as the input data but alters the format by replacing hyphens with periods. This transformation suggests a stylistic or structural preference for the representation of these identifiers or codes, rather than a change in the underlying value or meaning. The output retains the three-group structure, with each group still consisting of three digits, and the overall pattern now presented as "XXX.XXX.XXX".

### Relationship Between Input and Output:

The transformation from the input to the output column data is purely cosmetic, involving the substitution of separators between the digit groups: hyphens are replaced with periods. This change does not alter the numerical or qualitative value of the data but may reflect a preference or requirement for a different format in the context where the output is used. The process is consistent and uniform across all data points, indicating a straightforward, rule-based conversion with no exceptions or conditional alterations. This suggests that the primary relationship between the input and output is one of format standardization or normalization for subsequent use or analysis., and input as ['938-242-504'] output is 938.242.504, input as ['308-916-545'] output is 308.916.545, input as ['623-599-749'] output is 623.599.749, input as ['981-424-843'] output is 981.424.843, input as ['118-980-214'] output is 118.980.214, input as ['244-655-094'] output is 244.655.094, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
