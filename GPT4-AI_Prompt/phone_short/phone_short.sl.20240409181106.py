Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Summary of Input Column Data

The input data consists of strings formatted as three groups of three digits each, separated by hyphens (e.g., 'XXX-XXX-XXX'). Each string appears to represent a unique identifier or code, possibly following a specific pattern or structure that is not immediately discernible from the given examples alone. The first group of three digits in each string varies, suggesting a form of categorization or a unique identifier system. The second and third groups also vary across the examples, but their relationship to the output or their significance within the input data is not directly clear from the provided information.

### Summary of Output Column Data

The output data consists of integers extracted from the input data. Specifically, the output for each row is derived from the first group of three digits in the corresponding input string. This suggests a direct relationship between the input and output, where the output serves as a simplified or condensed representation of the input, focusing solely on the initial segment of the input string.

### Relationship Between Input and Output

The relationship between the input and output data is straightforward: the output is directly extracted from the first group of three digits of the input string. This extraction process simplifies the input data, reducing it to its initial numerical component and discarding the rest of the information contained in the input string. The process suggests that the most significant part of the input, at least in terms of the relationship defined by the examples, is the first group of digits. This could imply that the first group of digits holds primary importance in whatever system or context these data are being used, serving as a key identifier or category that is of particular interest or relevance. The remaining parts of the input string, while potentially carrying additional information or serving other purposes, are not reflected in the output and thus are considered secondary or irrelevant to the specific relationship or process being highlighted by these examples., and input as ['938-242-504'] output is 938, input as ['308-916-545'] output is 308, input as ['623-599-749'] output is 623, input as ['981-424-843'] output is 981, input as ['118-980-214'] output is 118, input as ['244-655-094'] output is 244, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
