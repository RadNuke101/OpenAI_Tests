Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Given the data and the task description, we can observe a straightforward relationship between the input and the output. The input data consists of strings formatted as three groups of three digits each, separated by hyphens (e.g., '938-242-504'). The output is the first group of three digits from the input (e.g., 938).

### Summary for Input Column Data:
- **Format:** The input data is uniformly formatted as strings containing three groups of three digits each, separated by hyphens.
- **Variability:** Each input string appears to be unique in this dataset, suggesting a wide range of possible values.
- **Qualitative Nature:** Despite being composed of digits, the input is treated as qualitative data, meaning we're interested in the pattern or format rather than the numerical value of the data.

### Summary for Output Column:
- **Extraction of Data:** The output data is consistently the first group of three digits extracted from the input data.
- **Uniformity:** The output maintains a uniform format of three digits, directly correlating with the first part of the input data.
- **Direct Relationship:** There is a direct and simple relationship between the input and output, with the output being a subset of the input.

### Relationship Summary:
The relationship between the input and output data is direct and straightforward. The output is always the first set of three digits from the input string, indicating a simple extraction process without any transformation or manipulation of the data. This process treats the input data qualitatively, focusing on the structure and pattern of the data rather than its numerical value. The consistency in the format of both the input and output data suggests a systematic approach to data handling, where the primary interest lies in segmenting or categorizing the input based on its first group of digits., and input as ['938-242-504'] output is 938, input as ['308-916-545'] output is 308, input as ['623-599-749'] output is 623, input as ['981-424-843'] output is 981, input as ['118-980-214'] output is 118, input as ['244-655-094'] output is 244, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
