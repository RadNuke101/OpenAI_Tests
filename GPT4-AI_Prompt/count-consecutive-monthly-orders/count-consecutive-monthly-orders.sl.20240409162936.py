Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: To generate a summary for the input and output data, we'll first need to understand the structure and nature of the data provided. The data consists of input-output pairs where each input is a list of six numbers, and the output is a single number. We are treating the input numbers as qualitative data, which means we're interested in the patterns or categories within the data rather than their numerical values.

### Input Data Summary:

- **Distribution of Values:** The input data across all examples includes numbers ranging from 0 to 7. Each input list contains six numbers, which may repeat within a list.
- **Patterns and Categories:** The input data does not immediately suggest a clear categorical division based on the examples provided. However, since we're treating the data qualitatively, we can note the presence of zeros as potentially significant, as well as the distribution of numbers (whether they are spread out or clustered).

### Output Data Summary:

- **Range of Values:** The output is a single number that, in the given examples, ranges from 2 to 6.
- **Possible Relationship with Input:** The output does not directly correlate with any simple arithmetic operation on the input numbers (such as sum or average). However, it might relate to the pattern, arrangement, or specific categories identified within the input lists.

### Relationship Between Input and Output:

Given the qualitative treatment of the data, we can hypothesize that the output might be related to one or more of the following factors:

1. **Presence and Count of Specific Numbers:** The output could be influenced by the presence of specific numbers within the input list or how many times certain numbers appear.
2. **Patterns of Distribution:** The arrangement of numbers (e.g., sequences, repetitions, or the presence of zeros) might play a role in determining the output.
3. **Categorical Groupings:** If we were to categorize the input numbers (for instance, into low, medium, and high based on their values), the composition of these categories within each list might influence the output.

### Summary:

Without a clear numerical relationship, the connection between the input lists and the output numbers seems to hinge on qualitative aspects of the input data. This could involve the presence of specific numbers, their frequency, distribution patterns, or how the numbers might be categorically grouped. To precisely determine the relationship, a more detailed analysis or additional information about how the output is generated from the input would be necessary., and input as ['7 0 0 5 4 4'] output is 3, input as ['0 0 2 3 3 0'] output is 3, input as ['5 6 4 6 0 7'] output is 4, input as ['0 4 5 0 0 2'] output is 2, input as ['3 0 3 0 1 2'] output is 2, input as ['5 3 2 5 6 1'] output is 6, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
