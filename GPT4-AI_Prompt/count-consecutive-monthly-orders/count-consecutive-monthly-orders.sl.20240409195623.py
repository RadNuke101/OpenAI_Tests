Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: To generate a summary for each input column and the output column based on the provided data, we'll first examine the data closely to understand the patterns and relationships. The input data is given in rows of six numbers each, and for each row, there is a corresponding output number. Let's break down the data column-wise and then look at the output.

### Input Column Summaries

- **Column 1 Summary**: The first column contains the numbers [7, 0, 5, 0, 3, 5]. This column features a mix of numbers ranging from 0 to 7, with no immediately apparent pattern in terms of increasing or decreasing values. The numbers here are both in the lower (0, 3) and higher (5, 7) ends of the range.

- **Column 2 Summary**: The second column has the numbers [0, 0, 6, 4, 0, 3]. This column also shows a variety of numbers but with a noticeable presence of zeros. The numbers range from 0 to 6, with a mix of low (0) and mid-range values (3, 4, 6).

- **Column 3 Summary**: The third column's numbers are [0, 2, 4, 5, 3, 2]. Here, we see numbers ranging from 0 to 5, with no zeros at the higher end. This column seems to have a more even distribution of mid-range numbers.

- **Column 4 Summary**: In the fourth column, the numbers are [5, 3, 6, 0, 0, 5]. This column includes a range from 0 to 6, with a notable presence of zeros and higher values (5, 6), suggesting a mix of absence (0) and significant values.

- **Column 5 Summary**: The fifth column contains [4, 3, 0, 0, 1, 6]. The numbers here range from 0 to 6, with zeros indicating a lack of something or a baseline, and the other numbers spread across the low to high range.

- **Column 6 Summary**: The sixth column has the numbers [4, 0, 7, 2, 2, 1]. This column features numbers from 0 to 7, showing a full range from the lowest to the highest values in the dataset.

### Output Column Summary

The output numbers are [3, 3, 4, 2, 2, 6]. These outputs range from 2 to 6, indicating a variety of outcomes based on the inputs. The output does not go below 2 or above 6 in the given dataset.

### Relationship Summary

Upon examining the input and output data, it's challenging to deduce a precise mathematical or quantitative relationship due to the qualitative nature of the task. However, we can infer that the output seems to be influenced by a combination of factors:

1. **Presence of Zeros**: Columns with zeros might indicate situations where the absence of a certain factor influences the outcome.
2. **Spread of Values**: The diversity in the numbers across columns suggests that the output is not determined by a single column but rather a combination of inputs.
3. **Range of Outcomes**: The output varies from 2 to 6, which could imply that certain combinations of inputs are more influential than others, leading to higher or lower outcomes.

The relationship between input and output in this dataset appears to be complex, with no single input column directly dictating the output. Instead, the output likely results from a combination or pattern of numbers across the input columns, possibly considering factors like the presence or absence of certain values (e.g., zeros), the diversity of numbers, and their distribution. Without a clear quantitative relationship, it's plausible that the output is determined by a set of rules or conditions based on the qualitative aspects of the input data., and input as ['7 0 0 5 4 4'] output is 3, input as ['0 0 2 3 3 0'] output is 3, input as ['5 6 4 6 0 7'] output is 4, input as ['0 4 5 0 0 2'] output is 2, input as ['3 0 3 0 1 2'] output is 2, input as ['5 3 2 5 6 1'] output is 6, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
