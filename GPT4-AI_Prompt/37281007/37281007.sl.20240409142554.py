Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Input Column Summary

The input data consists of two columns. The first column contains strings that are combinations of uppercase letters, which can vary in length and composition. These strings do not follow a specific pattern and can be any sequence of letters from the English alphabet. The second column also contains strings made up of uppercase letters, and these strings can either be subsets of the strings in the first column or entirely different sequences. The length of the strings in the second column can vary, but they are generally shorter or equal in length to their corresponding strings in the first column.

### Output Column Summary

The output data is a single column consisting of boolean values: true or false. These values represent whether or not the string in the second input column is a substring of the string in the first input column. If the second string can be found within the first string, the output is true; otherwise, it is false. This output is determined for each row based on the relationship between the two input strings in that row.

### Relationship Summary

The relationship between the input columns and the output column is based on the substring presence. Specifically, the output (true or false) is determined by checking if the string in the second input column is contained within the string in the first input column. If the second string is a substring of the first, the output is true, indicating a match. If the second string is not found within the first, the output is false, indicating no match. This relationship is consistent across all rows, making the output directly dependent on the substring matching criteria between the two input strings., and input as ['ABC', 'D'] output is false, input as ['ABC', 'BC'] output is true, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
