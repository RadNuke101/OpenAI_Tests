Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Input Column Summary

The input data consists of pairs of strings, each representing a type of fruit. These pairs are qualitative in nature and are used to compare two instances of fruit names. The comparison seems to focus on the exact match of the strings, including case sensitivity. The fruits mentioned in the provided examples include "apple," "orange," "peach," and "cherry." The variations in the pairs come from differences in capitalization, suggesting that the data might be used to examine how slight variations in string representation (specifically, case sensitivity) affect a certain outcome.

### Output Column Summary

The output data is binary (true or false), indicating a result based on the comparison of the two strings in each input pair. A "true" output suggests that the two strings in the pair are considered equivalent under the criteria being applied, while a "false" output indicates they are not. Given the examples, the criteria for equivalence appear to include case sensitivity, as pairs with identical strings regardless of case differences yield a "true" output, while those with any case differences yield a "false" output.

### Relationship Summary

The relationship between the input and output data is straightforward: the output is determined by whether the two strings in each input pair are exactly the same, including case sensitivity. If the strings match exactly, the output is "true," indicating a perfect match. If there is any difference between the strings, including differences in capitalization, the output is "false," indicating a mismatch. This relationship suggests that the purpose of the data might be to explore or demonstrate the importance of exact string matching in certain contexts, highlighting how even minor differences (such as capitalization) can lead to different outcomes in data processing or comparison tasks., and input as ['apple', 'apple'] output is true, input as ['orange', 'Orange'] output is false, input as ['peach', 'peach'] output is true, input as ['cherry', 'cherrY'] output is false, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.

# Test cases based on the provided examples
# Since the function returns a value, these lines will not output anything by themselves
