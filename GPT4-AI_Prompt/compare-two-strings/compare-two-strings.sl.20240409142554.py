Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Input Column Summary:

The input data consists of pairs of strings, each representing a type of fruit. Each pair can either be identical in terms of spelling and case sensitivity or differ either in spelling, case sensitivity, or both. The fruits mentioned in the dataset include "apple," "orange," "peach," and "cherry," indicating a variety of common fruits. The data suggests a focus on comparing these string pairs based on their exact match, including case sensitivity, to determine a specific outcome.

### Output Column Summary:

The output data is binary, represented by boolean values true or false. The output directly correlates with the comparison of the two strings in each input pair. When the strings are exactly the same, including case sensitivity, the output is true. Conversely, when there is any difference between the two strings, whether in spelling or case sensitivity, the output is false. This binary outcome indicates a strict comparison criterion focused on exact matches.

### Relationship Summary:

The relationship between the input and output data is governed by a case-sensitive comparison of string pairs. The output is determined by whether the two strings in each pair are identical in every aspect, including case. If they match exactly, the output is true, indicating a perfect match. If there is any discrepancy, whether in spelling or case, the output is false, indicating a mismatch. This relationship showcases the importance of precision in string comparison, emphasizing that even minor differences such as capitalization can lead to a different outcome. The dataset serves as a clear example of how qualitative data, in this case, strings representing fruit names, can be subjected to binary classification based on specific criteria, highlighting the significance of exactitude in data comparison tasks., and input as ['apple', 'apple'] output is true, input as ['orange', 'Orange'] output is false, input as ['peach', 'peach'] output is true, input as ['cherry', 'cherrY'] output is false, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
