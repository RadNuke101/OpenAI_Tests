Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Input Column Summary:

The input data consists of pairs of strings, each representing a type of fruit. These pairs are qualitative in nature and are used to compare two instances of fruit names. The comparison seems to focus on the exactness of the spelling, including case sensitivity. The fruits mentioned in the provided examples include "apple," "orange," "peach," and "cherry." The variations in the pairs come from differences in capitalization, which suggests that the data might be used to examine the impact of case sensitivity on string equality.

### Output Column Summary:

The output data is binary (true or false), indicating a result based on a comparison between the two input strings in each pair. A "true" output signifies that the two strings are identical in every aspect, including case, while a "false" output indicates any discrepancy between the two strings, no matter how minor, such as a difference in capitalization.

### Relationship Summary:

The relationship between the input and output columns is based on string equality with respect to case sensitivity. The output is "true" when both strings in the input pair are exactly the same, including the same case (uppercase or lowercase letters). Conversely, the output is "false" when there is any difference between the two strings, even if it's just a difference in the capitalization of one letter. This indicates that the comparison operation being performed is case-sensitive and does not consider two strings to be equal if there is any variation in case between them. This relationship highlights the importance of exact string matching in the context of the data provided, suggesting that the intended analysis or operation is sensitive to even the smallest variations in the input strings., and input as ['apple', 'apple'] output is true, input as ['orange', 'Orange'] output is false, input as ['peach', 'peach'] output is true, input as ['cherry', 'cherrY'] output is false, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
