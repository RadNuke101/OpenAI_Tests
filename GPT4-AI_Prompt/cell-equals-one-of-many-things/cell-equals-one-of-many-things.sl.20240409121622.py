Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Input Column Summary:

The input data consists of a single column containing qualitative, categorical data representing colors. The colors mentioned include a mix of primary colors (e.g., blue), secondary colors (e.g., orange), and other common colors (e.g., pink, yellow, gray, black). There is also an instance of a non-color entry ('turkey'), which seems to be an outlier or a misclassification in the context of color categorization. The variety of colors suggests an exploration of a characteristic or property that could be associated with these colors, aiming to understand what might differentiate them based on the given output.

### Output Column Summary:

The output data is binary, represented by boolean values true or false. This binary nature indicates that the input colors are being evaluated based on a specific criterion or set of criteria, leading to a determination of either meeting the condition (true) or not meeting it (false).

### Relationship Summary:

Analyzing the relationship between the input colors and the binary output, it appears that the criterion for a 'true' output might be related to the perception, representation, or perhaps cultural significance of the colors. Given the data:

- Colors like 'yellow', 'blue', 'pink', and 'orange' yield a 'true' output.
- Colors like 'gray' and 'black', and the non-color 'turkey', yield a 'false' output.

One possible interpretation is that the 'true' output could be associated with colors that are generally perceived as more vibrant, lively, or having positive connotations in various cultures. In contrast, 'gray' and 'black' are often associated with neutrality, negativity, or lack of vibrancy, which could explain their 'false' output. The entry 'turkey' being false suggests that the criterion is strictly applicable to recognized colors, excluding non-color entities.

This relationship suggests that the output is determined by how these colors are perceived in terms of vibrancy, positivity, or perhaps their usage in specific contexts that value such characteristics. However, without more explicit criteria, this remains a hypothesis based on the observed pattern in the provided data., and input as ['yellow'] output is true, input as ['gray'] output is false, input as ['black'] output is false, input as ['blue'] output is true, input as ['pink'] output is true, input as ['orange'] output is true, input as ['turkey'] output is false, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
