Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Input Column Summary:

The input data consists of a single column containing qualitative descriptors, specifically names of colors (e.g., 'yellow', 'gray', 'black', 'blue', 'pink', 'orange') and one non-color term ('turkey'). These inputs are categorical and represent a mix of primary colors, secondary colors, and a neutral color, along with an outlier that does not fit into the color category.

### Output Column Summary:

The output data is binary, represented by boolean values true or false. The output indicates a certain property or characteristic that is either present (true) or absent (false) based on the input color.

### Relationship Summary:

Analyzing the given input-output pairs, the relationship between the input colors and the output boolean values suggests that the output is true for certain colors and false for others, including the non-color term. Specifically:

- Colors such as 'yellow', 'blue', 'pink', and 'orange' yield a true output. These colors are either primary (blue, yellow) or are perceived as warm and positive colors (pink, orange).
- Colors like 'gray' and 'black', which are neutral or considered more somber, result in a false output.
- The non-color term 'turkey' also results in a false output, indicating that the output is only true for specific colors.

This suggests that the output might be related to the perceived warmth, positivity, or primary status of the color, with neutral, somber colors, and non-color terms not meeting the criteria for a true output. The exact nature of the characteristic or property determining the output is not specified but could be related to these aspects of color perception., and input as ['yellow'] output is true, input as ['gray'] output is false, input as ['black'] output is false, input as ['blue'] output is true, input as ['pink'] output is true, input as ['orange'] output is true, input as ['turkey'] output is false, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
