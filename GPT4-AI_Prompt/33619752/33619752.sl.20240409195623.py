Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Summary of Input Column Data:

The input column data consists of company names in various forms, including their full legal names and more commonly used short names. These names represent a mix of industries, from technology giants like Microsoft and General Electric to entertainment powerhouses like Nintendo. The variations in the names include the addition of legal identifiers such as "Inc," "Corporation," and "Enterprises," which are typical suffixes that denote the legal status of a company. The presence of these variations suggests that the input data might be sourced from a diverse array of documents or databases, where companies are referred to both formally and informally.

### Summary of Output Column Data:

The output column data standardizes the company names by removing legal identifiers and suffixes, presenting a simplified version of each company's name. This process results in a uniform representation of the companies, focusing solely on the most recognizable part of their names. The output names are concise and are likely intended for contexts where the legal status of the company is irrelevant, or the audience is expected to be familiar with the companies without needing their full legal titles.

### Relationship Between Input and Output:

The transformation from the input to the output column data demonstrates a process of normalization and simplification of company names. This process strips away the legal designations and suffixes that can vary widely and focuses on the core name that is most commonly used and recognized by the public. The relationship between the input and output suggests an effort to create a more user-friendly or accessible representation of company names, possibly for use in environments where simplicity and ease of recognition are paramount. This could be particularly useful in consumer-facing applications, marketing materials, or in databases where consistency in naming conventions is desired to facilitate search and retrieval. The methodology applied here effectively bridges the gap between formal legal nomenclature and the everyday language used by the general public., and input as ['General Electric'] output is General Electric, input as ['General Electric Inc'] output is General Electric, input as ['General Electric Company'] output is General Electric, input as ['Microsoft'] output is Microsoft, input as ['Microsoft Corporation'] output is Microsoft, input as ['Nintendo'] output is Nintendo, input as ['Nintendo Enterprises'] output is Nintendo, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
