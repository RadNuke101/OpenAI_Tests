Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Summary of Input Column Data

#### First Name Column:
The first names provided in the input data are diverse, representing a range of cultural backgrounds and genders. Names like Launa, Lakenya, Brendan, Bradford, and Rudolf indicate a variety of origins and suggest a broad spectrum of individuals. These names do not follow a specific pattern in terms of syllables, phonetics, or cultural significance, highlighting the heterogeneity of the dataset. The diversity in first names suggests that the dataset encompasses a wide array of individuals without bias towards a particular gender, ethnicity, or cultural group.

#### Last Name Column:
The last names, such as Withers, Edison, Hage, Lango, and Akiyama, also exhibit a wide range of cultural backgrounds, indicating a multicultural dataset. These surnames vary in their phonetic complexity and ethnic origins, ranging from Anglo-Saxon to Japanese. This variation further underscores the diversity present in the dataset and suggests that the data could be from a globally distributed sample or a multicultural region. The last names do not seem to follow any specific pattern or theme, reinforcing the notion of a diverse and inclusive dataset.

### Summary of Output Column Data

The output data format consistently transforms the input names into a standardized form, showcasing the last name followed by the first initial of the given name, separated by a comma and a space. This transformation suggests a formal or professional context where such a naming convention might be preferred, such as academic citations, professional directories, or formal correspondences. The output format emphasizes the last name, which could be indicative of cultures or contexts where the family name holds precedence or where individual identification within larger systems (e.g., databases, organizational charts) is streamlined through the use of surnames and initials. This standardized format aids in creating a uniform, easily searchable, and concise method of representing names, which could be particularly useful in databases, research papers, or any scenario requiring a high level of organization and consistency.

### Relationship Between Input and Output

The relationship between the input and output data lies in the systematic transformation of full names into a formal, standardized naming convention. This process involves prioritizing the surname and reducing the given name to its initial, thereby creating a concise and uniform representation of an individual's name. This transformation could serve multiple purposes, such as anonymizing data to a certain degree, ensuring consistency in data recording, or adhering to formal naming conventions in specific contexts. The method of transformation does not alter the cultural or ethnic significance of the names but rather presents them in a format that is widely recognized and utilized in formal and professional environments. This relationship underscores the importance of standardized data formats for ease of use, searchability, and consistency in diverse datasets., and input as ['Launa', 'Withers'] output is Withers, L., input as ['Lakenya', 'Edison'] output is Edison, L., input as ['Brendan', 'Hage'] output is Hage, B., input as ['Bradford', 'Lango'] output is Lango, B., input as ['Rudolf', 'Akiyama'] output is Akiyama, R., , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
