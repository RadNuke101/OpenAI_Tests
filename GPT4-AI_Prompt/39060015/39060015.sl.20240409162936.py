Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Summary of Input Column Data

The input data consists of strings that are structured with specific commands embedded within them. These commands include directives like "/delete" which signifies the start of a section that should be removed from the input text, and "/keep" which might indicate the beginning of content that should be retained, although the explicit "/keep" command's functionality is not directly demonstrated in the provided examples. The input strings may contain regular narrative or textual content alongside these commands. The structure and content of these commands suggest that the input data is being prepared for a processing task where certain parts of the text are selectively removed based on the embedded instructions.

### Summary of Output Column Data

The output data represents the processed form of the input strings after applying the instructions embedded within them. Specifically, the output is the result of deleting sections of the input text as indicated by the "/delete" command and potentially retaining or emphasizing other parts of the text. The output strings are essentially cleaned versions of the input, where specific directives have been acted upon to remove or alter parts of the original text. The output is characterized by the absence of the commands found in the input and presents a more streamlined version of the text that focuses on the content meant to be kept or highlighted.

### Relationship Between Input and Output

The relationship between the input and output data is defined by a transformation process guided by specific commands within the input text. This process involves identifying and acting upon directives like "/delete" to modify the original text accordingly. The transformation results in output that has been cleaned or edited to meet the criteria specified by the embedded instructions in the input. The essence of this relationship is the selective retention or removal of content based on predefined rules or commands, leading to an output that is a curated version of the input, stripped of certain elements as dictated by the processing instructions. This indicates a structured approach to text manipulation, where the input serves as a template containing both the original content and the rules for its modification, and the output is the product of applying these rules., and input as ['This is a line. /delete words in the area /keep this part'] output is This is a line. keep this part, input as ['/delete words in the area /'] output is , , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
