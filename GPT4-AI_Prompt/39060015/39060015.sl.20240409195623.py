Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Summary of Input Column Data

The input data consists of strings that contain textual content with specific directives embedded within them. These directives include commands like "/delete" which seems to indicate the removal of certain parts of the text, and "/keep" which might suggest retaining specific segments of the text. The input strings appear to be instructions for text manipulation, where certain words or phrases are targeted for deletion or preservation based on the commands provided. The structure of the input data suggests a mix of narrative or descriptive content combined with operational commands that directly influence the composition of the output text.

### Summary of Output Column Data

The output data represents the result of processing the input strings according to the embedded commands. Specifically, it shows the textual content that remains after the deletion commands have been executed and the specified segments to be kept are retained. The output is essentially a cleaned or modified version of the input text, stripped of certain elements as dictated by the "/delete" instructions and potentially reorganized or focused based on the "/keep" directives. The output strings are thus a distilled form of the input, reflecting the intended manipulations specified within the original text.

### Relationship Between Input and Output

The relationship between the input and output data is fundamentally transformative, governed by the specific commands embedded within the input text. The process involves interpreting the commands ("/delete" for removal and "/keep" for retention), applying these instructions to the input text, and generating an output that reflects the desired modifications. This transformation is selective and directive-based, meaning that the output is directly shaped by the instructions provided in the input. The essence of this relationship is the execution of text manipulation tasks that alter the original content according to predefined rules or commands, resulting in an output that is a modified, often simplified version of the input. This process highlights a structured approach to text editing, where specific parts of the text are targeted for action, leading to a customized output that aligns with the specified directives., and input as ['This is a line. /delete words in the area /keep this part'] output is This is a line. keep this part, input as ['/delete words in the area /'] output is , , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
