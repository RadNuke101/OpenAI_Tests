Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Summary of Input Column Data

The input data consists of strings that are composed of sentences or phrases, potentially including specific commands such as "/delete" and "/keep". These commands appear to instruct on how to manipulate the text within the string. The "/delete" command suggests that the text following it, up until a certain point or the next command, should be removed from the output. Conversely, the "/keep" command indicates that the text following it should be retained or emphasized in the output. The input data is qualitative, representing textual information that requires processing based on the embedded commands to generate the desired output.

### Summary of Output Column Data

The output data is the result of processing the input strings according to the embedded commands ("/delete" and "/keep"). The output retains only the portions of the input text that are either not marked for deletion or explicitly marked to be kept. This results in a cleaner, possibly shorter string that excludes specified parts of the original input. The output is also qualitative, representing a refined version of the input text after applying the given instructions.

### Relationship Between Input and Output

The relationship between the input and output data is defined by the transformation process, which interprets and applies the commands found within the input text. This process effectively filters the input text, removing or retaining parts of it to produce the output. The transformation is guided by the specific commands ("/delete" for removal and "/keep" for retention), which dictate which portions of the text are excluded from or included in the final output. The output is directly dependent on the input but is modified to reflect the instructions given within the input text, showcasing a clear cause-and-effect relationship where the input commands directly influence the composition of the output text., and input as ['This is a line. /delete words in the area /keep this part'] output is This is a line. keep this part, input as ['/delete words in the area /'] output is , , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
