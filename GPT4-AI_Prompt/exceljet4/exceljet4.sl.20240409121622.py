Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Input Column Summary:

The input data consists of strings that represent URLs or addresses, each prefixed with a protocol identifier followed by "://". The protocols observed in the given examples include "https", "ftp", and "sftp". These protocols are essential for defining the method of access or the communication protocol to reach the resource specified by the remainder of the string. The rest of the string after the protocol and "://" sequence represents the domain name or IP address, possibly followed by additional path information. The examples provided range from commercial websites to IP addresses, indicating a variety of resource types and locations. The input data is qualitative, representing different types of web resources identified by their access protocols and addresses.

### Output Column Summary:

The output data retains the core component of the input data, which is the domain name or IP address and any subsequent path information, but it omits the protocol identifier and the "://". This transformation suggests that the output is focused on the location of the resource without specifying the method of access. The output is also qualitative, providing a simplified identifier for the resource that is more about the "where" than the "how" of accessing it. The examples include commercial domains, catalog paths, and an IP address, reflecting a diverse range of web resources.

### Relationship Summary:

The relationship between the input and output data is a transformation that removes the protocol identifier and the "://", simplifying the resource identifier to its essential components: the domain name or IP address and any path information. This process effectively strips away the access method layer, leaving a cleaner, more universally understandable representation of the resource location. This transformation could be useful in contexts where the focus is on identifying or cataloging resources by location rather than specifying how to access them. It simplifies the data for purposes that may include display, storage, or further processing where the protocol is irrelevant or assumed. This summary highlights the transition from a more technical, protocol-specific representation of web resources to a simplified, location-centric view., and input as ['https=//exceljet.net/catalog'] output is exceljet.net/catalog, input as ['https=//microsoft.com'] output is microsoft.com, input as ['ftp=//someserver.com'] output is someserver.com, input as ['sftp=//127.0.0.1'] output is 127.0.0.1, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
