Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Summary of Input Column Data

The input data consists of strings that represent URLs or addresses, each prefixed with a protocol identifier followed by "://". The protocols identified in the examples include "https", "ftp", and "sftp", which are common protocols used on the internet for secure and insecure data transfer. The remainder of each string after the protocol identifier and "://" sequence represents a domain name or an IP address. These strings vary in their domain extensions (e.g., ".net", ".com") and specificity, ranging from commercial website addresses to a specific IP address. The input data showcases a variety of web resources, indicating a broad range of internet-based locations or services.

### Summary of Output Column Data

The output data retains only the significant portion of the web addresses or IP addresses from the input data, specifically the domain name or the IP address itself, by removing the protocol identifier and the "://" sequence. This process simplifies the URLs to their essential components, focusing on the location of the resources without specifying the protocol for accessing them. The output data is cleaner and more concise, emphasizing the identity of the web resources or servers without the additional details on how to establish a connection to them.

### Relationship Between Input and Output

The transformation from input to output data demonstrates a process of simplification and standardization of web addresses or IP addresses by removing the protocol identifiers. This process highlights the core information (the domain name or IP address) that identifies the resource on the internet. The relationship between the input and output data underscores the distinction between the address of a web resource and the method used to access it (as indicated by the protocol). By stripping away the protocol, the output focuses solely on the location of the resource, making it a more streamlined representation that could be useful in contexts where the method of access is either understood, irrelevant, or to be determined separately. This simplification could facilitate easier handling, comparison, or categorization of web resources based on their domain names or IP addresses alone., and input as ['https=//exceljet.net/catalog'] output is exceljet.net/catalog, input as ['https=//microsoft.com'] output is microsoft.com, input as ['ftp=//someserver.com'] output is someserver.com, input as ['sftp=//127.0.0.1'] output is 127.0.0.1, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
