Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Based on the provided data, we can observe a pattern in the relationship between the input and output columns. The input data is structured in a consistent format of three groups of three digits each, separated by hyphens (e.g., XXX-XXX-XXX). The output data consists of a three-digit number for each input.

**Summary of Input Column Data:**
- The input data is formatted as a string of nine digits divided into three equal parts by hyphens.
- Each part of the input data consists of three digits.
- The input data appears to be random with no immediately discernible pattern in the distribution of numbers within each part.

**Summary of Output Column Data:**
- The output data is a three-digit number.
- Each output directly corresponds to the last group of three digits in the input data.

**Relationship Between Input and Output:**
- The relationship between the input and output data is direct and straightforward. The output for each row is extracted from the input data as the last group of three digits. This indicates that the output is not determined by any computational process applied to the numbers in the input but is simply a matter of extracting a specific portion of the input string.
- This pattern suggests that if given any input following the same format (XXX-XXX-XXX), the output can be predicted by isolating the last three digits of the input.

In summary, the relationship between the input and output columns is that the output is a direct extraction of the last segment of the input data, treating the input purely as qualitative data without any numerical manipulation., and input as ['938-242-504'] output is 504, input as ['308-916-545'] output is 545, input as ['623-599-749'] output is 749, input as ['981-424-843'] output is 843, input as ['118-980-214'] output is 214, input as ['244-655-094'] output is 094, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
