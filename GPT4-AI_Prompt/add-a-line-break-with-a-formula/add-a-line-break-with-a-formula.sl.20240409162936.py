Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Input Column Summaries

#### Column 1: Name
- **Content Description**: This column contains the full names of individuals, which are composed of a first name and a last name. The names appear to be of people residing in the United States, given the context of the addresses in the subsequent columns.
- **Data Type**: Textual/String.
- **Variability**: High, as each entry is unique, representing different individuals.

#### Column 2: Street Address
- **Content Description**: This column lists the street addresses of the individuals named in the first column. Each entry includes a house number followed by the street name.
- **Data Type**: Textual/String.
- **Variability**: High, with each address being unique to the individual.

#### Column 3: City, State, and ZIP Code
- **Content Description**: The third column provides the city, state abbreviation, and ZIP code for each individual's address. This information complements the street address in column 2, providing a complete mailing address.
- **Data Type**: Textual/String, with a structured format for city, state abbreviation, and ZIP code.
- **Variability**: Moderate to high, as some individuals may reside in the same city or state, but ZIP codes add a level of specificity.

### Output Column Summary

- **Content Description**: The output column combines the information from the three input columns into a single string for each individual, separated by "/n" (intended to represent a newline character, though it seems to be a typographical error and should be "\n"). This output format presents the full name, street address, and city/state/ZIP code on separate lines for each entry, mimicking the format of a mailing address.
- **Data Type**: Textual/String, with a specific structure that mimics the format of a postal address.
- **Variability**: High, as each output is unique to the individual's combined name and address information.

### Relationship Between Input and Output

The output is a structured amalgamation of the input columns, designed to present each individual's complete mailing address in a format that is typical for postal services or formal documentation. The transformation process involves concatenating the values from the three input columns for each row, with a specific separator ("/n") that is intended to represent line breaks. This process does not alter the original data but restructures it into a more compact and standardized format for each entry. The relationship between the input and output highlights a method of data consolidation, where multiple pieces of related information are combined into a single, coherent format that is easy to read and use for mailing or identification purposes., and input as ['Traci Brown', '1301 Robinson Court', 'Saginaw, MI 48607'] output is Traci Brown/n1301 Robinson Court/nSaginaw, MI 48607, input as ['Mary Hannan', '1195 Amethyst Drive', 'Lansing, MI 48933'] output is Mary Hannan/n1195 Amethyst Drive/nLansing, MI 48933, input as ['Linda Thomas', '2479 North Bend Road', 'Allen, KY 41601'] output is Linda Thomas/n2479 North Bend Road/nAllen, KY 41601, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
