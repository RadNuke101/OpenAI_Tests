Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Input Column Summaries:

1. **First Column (Names):** This column contains the full names of individuals, which are composed of a first name and a last name. The names appear to be of people residing in the United States, given the context of the addresses in the subsequent columns. The names are diverse, indicating a variety of backgrounds without any apparent pattern or restriction on the type of names included.

2. **Second Column (Street Addresses):** The addresses listed in this column are specific to residential or possibly business locations. They include a street number followed by the name of the street and sometimes additional descriptors like 'Drive', 'Court', or 'Road'. These addresses provide a precise location within a city or town but do not include city, state, or ZIP code information.

3. **Third Column (City, State, ZIP):** This column completes the address information started in the second column by providing the city name, the state abbreviation, and the ZIP code. The states mentioned (MI for Michigan and KY for Kentucky) indicate that the addresses are within the United States. The ZIP codes are consistent with the standard 5-digit format used in the U.S.

### Output Column Summary:

The output column combines the information from the three input columns into a single string for each record, formatted in a specific way. Each piece of information (name, street address, city/state/ZIP) is separated by a "/n" sequence, which seems to be an intended representation of a newline character (typically "\n"). This formatting suggests that the output is designed for display or printing purposes where each piece of information is presented on a new line, replicating the traditional format of an address block. The output maintains the order of information as presented in the input columns, ensuring a logical and readable structure.

### Relationship Between Input and Output:

The transformation from input to output demonstrates a process of data consolidation and formatting. The input data, initially segmented into discrete columns for names, street addresses, and city/state/ZIP codes, is merged into a single, formatted string that represents a complete address block. This process does not alter the content of the data but rearranges it into a format that is more suitable for certain applications, such as mailing, display on documents, or digital communication where address readability is crucial. The use of "/n" in the output suggests an intention to preserve or indicate line breaks in environments where explicit newline characters are necessary or when preparing the data for systems that interpret such sequences as line breaks., and input as ['Traci Brown', '1301 Robinson Court', 'Saginaw, MI 48607'] output is Traci Brown/n1301 Robinson Court/nSaginaw, MI 48607, input as ['Mary Hannan', '1195 Amethyst Drive', 'Lansing, MI 48933'] output is Mary Hannan/n1195 Amethyst Drive/nLansing, MI 48933, input as ['Linda Thomas', '2479 North Bend Road', 'Allen, KY 41601'] output is Linda Thomas/n2479 North Bend Road/nAllen, KY 41601, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
