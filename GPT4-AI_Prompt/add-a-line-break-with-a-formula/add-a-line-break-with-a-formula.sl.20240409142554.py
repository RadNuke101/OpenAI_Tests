Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Input Column Data Summary

**Column 1: Names**
- The first column contains full names of individuals, which are composed of a first name and a last name. These names are diverse, indicating a variety of individuals without any apparent pattern regarding gender, ethnicity, or age. The names serve as identifiers for the individuals associated with the addresses in the subsequent columns.

**Column 2: Street Addresses**
- The second column lists street addresses, which include a house number followed by the name of the street. These addresses are specific to residential or business locations and provide a physical location for the individual named in the first column. The addresses vary in terms of street names and numbers, indicating different physical locations.

**Column 3: City, State, and ZIP Code**
- The third column provides further details on the location by specifying the city, state, and ZIP code for each address listed in the second column. This information narrows down the geographical location to a specific area within the United States, offering a complete mailing address when combined with the second column.

### Output Column Data Summary

The output column combines the information from the three input columns into a single string for each individual, formatted in a specific way. The format follows a pattern where the individual's name is followed by their street address and then their city, state, and ZIP code, each separated by "/n" (intended to represent a newline character, though it seems to be a typographical error for "\n"). This output format effectively consolidates the separate pieces of input data into a cohesive, readable format suitable for displaying or printing mailing addresses in a standardized form.

### Relationship Between Input and Output

The relationship between the input columns and the output column is a transformation process that aggregates and formats the input data into a structured output. This process involves concatenating the separate strings from each input column into a single string with specified separators ("/n"), which likely was intended to be "\n" to denote new lines. This transformation is consistent across all examples, indicating a systematic approach to generating a formatted mailing address from the given input data. The output is designed to present the complete address information in a format that is both human-readable and suitable for use in mailing or address databases., and input as ['Traci Brown', '1301 Robinson Court', 'Saginaw, MI 48607'] output is Traci Brown/n1301 Robinson Court/nSaginaw, MI 48607, input as ['Mary Hannan', '1195 Amethyst Drive', 'Lansing, MI 48933'] output is Mary Hannan/n1195 Amethyst Drive/nLansing, MI 48933, input as ['Linda Thomas', '2479 North Bend Road', 'Allen, KY 41601'] output is Linda Thomas/n2479 North Bend Road/nAllen, KY 41601, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
