Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Input Column Data Summary

1. **Name (First Column):** The first column contains full names of individuals, which are composed of a first name and a last name. These names represent a diverse set of individuals, likely from various backgrounds. The names are personal identifiers and do not follow a specific pattern, reflecting the variety typically found in a population.

2. **Address (Second Column):** The second column lists street addresses. These addresses are specific locations within cities and are formatted to include the street number, street name, and sometimes additional descriptors (like apartment or suite numbers, though not present in the provided examples). The addresses are unique to each individual and serve as a physical location for mail delivery or residential identification.

3. **City and ZIP Code (Third Column):** The third column provides the city and ZIP code for each individual. This information is geographically specific and ties the individual not just to a broad location but to a very specific area within a state. The ZIP codes are numerical and follow the standard U.S. Postal Service format, which helps in sorting and delivering mail. The cities mentioned vary, indicating a geographical diversity among the individuals.

### Output Column Data Summary

The output column data is a structured representation of the input data, formatted in a specific way to perhaps meet the requirements of a database, mailing list, or document. Each individual's information is concatenated into a single string, with each piece of data separated by "/n". This format suggests a newline character is intended for each separation, indicating that when processed correctly, each piece of data (name, address, city, and ZIP code) would appear on its own line. This structured format is useful for readability, data entry, or importing into systems that require a specific data layout.

### Relationship Between Input and Output

The transformation from the input columns to the output column represents a process of data formatting and structuring. The input data, which is initially presented in a tabular or column-based format, is concatenated into a single string for each individual, with a specific separator ("/n") indicating where line breaks should occur. This process is essential for standardizing data presentation, making it suitable for various applications like mailing systems, databases, or documents that require a certain layout for readability or technical reasons.

The relationship between the input and output highlights the importance of data formatting in information management and communication. By converting the input data into a more structured and standardized format, it becomes easier to handle, share, and utilize the information across different platforms and for various purposes. This transformation process is crucial in data processing, ensuring that information is presented in a consistent and accessible manner., and input as ['Traci Brown', '1301 Robinson Court', 'Saginaw, MI 48607'] output is Traci Brown/n1301 Robinson Court/nSaginaw, MI 48607, input as ['Mary Hannan', '1195 Amethyst Drive', 'Lansing, MI 48933'] output is Mary Hannan/n1195 Amethyst Drive/nLansing, MI 48933, input as ['Linda Thomas', '2479 North Bend Road', 'Allen, KY 41601'] output is Linda Thomas/n2479 North Bend Road/nAllen, KY 41601, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
