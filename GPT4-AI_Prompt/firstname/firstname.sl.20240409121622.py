Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Input Column Summary:

The input data consists of a series of full names, each entry comprising a first name followed by a last name. These names represent individuals, likely from a diverse set of backgrounds given the variety in the naming conventions observed. Each entry is structured in a consistent format, with the first name and last name separated by a space. The names are presented in a single column, suggesting that the primary focus of the data collection is on individual identities, possibly for a context where personal identification or individual records are important. The diversity in names suggests a dataset that encompasses a wide range of cultural or geographical origins, indicating that the data collection does not limit itself to a specific demographic group.

### Output Column Summary:

The output data extracts and presents the first name from each full name provided in the input column. This process of extraction simplifies the data from a complete identity marker (full name) to a more casual or informal identifier (first name). The output, therefore, focuses on the aspect of personal identity that is most commonly used in informal, direct interactions. By isolating the first name, the output data streamlines communication or identification processes, potentially making it easier to address or refer to the individuals in contexts where familiarity or brevity is preferred. The consistency in the output format underscores a systematic approach to data processing, aimed at achieving uniformity and ease of use or reference.

### Relationship Between Input and Output:

The relationship between the input and output data is characterized by a process of simplification and focus. The input data provides a comprehensive view of individual identities through full names, encapsulating both the personal and familial dimensions of identity. The output data, on the other hand, distills this information to highlight only the personal dimension, represented by the first name. This transformation reflects a deliberate choice to prioritize ease of interaction and the informal aspects of personal identity over the more formal and complete identification provided by full names.

This process of extraction and simplification suggests that the underlying purpose of the data transformation is to facilitate interactions or processes where the full complexity of individual identities is unnecessary or where the emphasis is on personal rather than formal identification. The systematic nature of this transformation indicates that it is intended for applications where consistency and efficiency in personal identification are key considerations., and input as ['Nancy FreeHafer'] output is Nancy, input as ['Andrew Cencici'] output is Andrew, input as ['Jan Kotas'] output is Jan, input as ['Mariya Sergienko'] output is Mariya, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
