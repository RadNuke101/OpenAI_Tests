Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Summary of Input Column Data:

The input data consists of full names of individuals, each entry comprising a first name and a last name. These names span a diverse range of cultural backgrounds, indicating a wide variety of origins. The structure of the data is consistent, with each entry presented in a 'FirstName LastName' format. This uniformity suggests that the data was collected or formatted with a specific purpose in mind, likely to facilitate processing or analysis that focuses on one part of the name. The repetition of certain names indicates either a commonality in the dataset or a focus on specific individuals for repeated analysis.

### Summary of Output Column Data:

The output data extracts and presents the last name from each full name provided in the input data. This transformation from full names to last names suggests a focus on family names or surnames for the purpose of the analysis or processing at hand. The output retains the diversity of the input, reflecting the wide range of cultural backgrounds present in the original data. The consistency in output format, focusing solely on the last name, indicates a streamlined approach to data handling, possibly for categorization, sorting, or identification purposes.

### Relationship Between Input and Output:

The relationship between the input and output data is a direct extraction process, where the output is derived by isolating the last name from the full name provided in the input. This process highlights a specific interest in the family names of the individuals in the dataset, possibly for reasons related to identity verification, demographic studies, or database management where unique identifiers or sorting by last name are required. The methodical extraction across a diverse dataset suggests an automated or systematic approach to handling personal names, emphasizing the importance of surnames in the context of the analysis or application for which this data was prepared., and input as ['Nancy FreeHafer'] output is FreeHafer, input as ['Andrew Cencici'] output is Cencici, input as ['Jan Kotas'] output is Kotas, input as

If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
