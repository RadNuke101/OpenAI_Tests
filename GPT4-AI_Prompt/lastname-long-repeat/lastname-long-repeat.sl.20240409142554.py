Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Summary of Input Column Data:

The input data consists of a list of full names, each comprising a first name and a last name. These names represent a diverse set of individuals, with a variety of first and last names indicating a broad spectrum of cultural backgrounds. The names are presented in a consistent format, with the first name followed by the last name, separated by a space. The repetition of certain names suggests a focus on specific individuals or a limited sample size from a larger dataset. The diversity in the names implies a wide-ranging collection, potentially aiming to cover a broad demographic or to ensure inclusivity in the data representation.

### Summary of Output Column Data:

The output data extracts and presents the last name from each full name provided in the input data. This process consistently isolates the second part of each full name, indicating a systematic approach to identifying and separating the last names from the first names. The output showcases a variety of surnames, reflecting the diversity seen in the input data. The repetition of certain last names in the output, corresponding to the repeated full names in the input, underscores the focus on specific entries. This extraction process highlights the importance or relevance of the last names in the context of the dataset's intended use or analysis.

### Relationship Between Input and Output:

The relationship between the input and output data is characterized by a transformation process where each full name from the input is systematically broken down to isolate and extract the last name, which is then presented as the output. This transformation demonstrates a clear, one-to-one mapping from each full name to its corresponding last name. The purpose behind this extraction could be multifaceted, ranging from simplifying the data for analysis focused on family names, to preparing the data for processes or applications where the last name holds specific significance or utility. The consistent format of the input and the systematic nature of the output extraction process indicate a structured approach to data handling, aimed at facilitating further analysis, identification, or categorization based on last names., and input as ['Nancy FreeHafer'] output is FreeHafer, input as ['Andrew Cencici'] output is Cencici, input as ['Jan Kotas'] output is Kotas, input as ['Mariya

matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
