Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Summary of Input Column Data:

The input data consists of strings that represent phone numbers in an international format. Each string begins with a '+' sign, followed by a country code of varying lengths (one to three digits), a space, and then a sequence of three groups of digits separated by hyphens. The first group after the country code varies in length (three to four digits), as do the second and third groups (three digits each). The format can be summarized as follows: `+<country_code> <group1>-<group2>-<group3>`.

The variation in the length of the country code and the first group of digits after the country code suggests that the numbers are from different countries or regions, reflecting the diversity in international phone number formats. The consistent use of hyphens to separate groups of digits and the presence of a country code indicates adherence to a common international numbering plan, possibly designed for easier readability and identification of the country of origin.

### Summary of Output Column Data:

The output data consists of integers extracted from the input strings. Specifically, these integers are the last group of digits in each input string, following the last hyphen. The output numbers range from three digits, indicating that this part of the input data is uniform in length across all entries. The output numbers do not follow a discernible pattern or sequence, suggesting that they are specific identifiers or unique parts of the larger phone number, possibly serving as a local area or personal identifier within the broader international number.

### Relationship Between Input and Output:

The relationship between the input and output data is straightforward: the output is directly extracted from the input, representing the last segment of the international phone number provided in each input string. This segment, following the last hyphen, is consistently the third group of digits in the formatted phone number. The process of deriving the output from the input involves identifying and isolating this last segment of digits, disregarding the country code, the first group of digits, and the second group of digits. This extraction highlights the significance of the last segment in the context of the data provided, though the specific meaning or use of this segment (e.g., local area codes, personal identification numbers) is not defined within the summary and would depend on the broader context of the phone number's structure and usage., and input as ['+106 769-858-438'] output is 438, input as ['+83 973-757-831'] output is 831, input as ['+62 647-787-775'] output is 775, input as ['+172 027-507-632'] output is 632, input as ['+72 001-050-856'] output is 856, input as ['+95 310-537-401'] output is 401, input as ['+6 775-969-238'] output is 238, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
