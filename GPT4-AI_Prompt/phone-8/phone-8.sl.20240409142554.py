Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Summary of Input Column Data

The input data consists of strings that represent phone numbers formatted in a specific way. Each string begins with a country code prefixed with a plus sign ('+'), followed by a space, and then the phone number itself. The phone number is divided into three groups separated by hyphens ('-'). The first group appears to represent an area code or an initial segment of the phone number, the second group seems to be a middle segment, and the third group is the final segment of the phone number. The country codes and the segments of the phone numbers vary in length across the dataset, indicating a diversity in the origin or type of these phone numbers. The input data is qualitative as it represents categories of information (country codes and phone number segments) rather than numerical values that can be manipulated mathematically.

### Summary of Output Column Data

The output data consists of integers extracted from the input strings. Specifically, the output is the last segment of the phone numbers provided in the input. These integers range from three to four digits in length based on the examples given. The output data, while numerical, is treated as qualitative in this context because it represents a specific part of the phone number rather than a value meant for mathematical operations.

### Relationship Between Input and Output

The relationship between the input and output data is straightforward: the output is derived directly from the input by extracting the last segment of the phone number. This segment is the part of the phone number that follows the second hyphen. The process of deriving the output from the input does not involve any transformation or manipulation of the data beyond this extraction. The output is a specific, identifiable part of the input data, making the relationship between the two deterministic and direct. This extraction process highlights a pattern where, regardless of the country code or the initial segments of the phone number, the final segment is consistently identified and presented as the output., and input as ['+106 769-858-438'] output is 438, input as ['+83 973-757-831'] output is 831, input as ['+62 647-787-775'] output is 775, input as ['+172 027-507-632'] output is 632, input as ['+72 001-050-856'] output is 856, input as ['+95 310-537-401'] output is 401, input as ['+6 775-969-238'] output is 238, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
