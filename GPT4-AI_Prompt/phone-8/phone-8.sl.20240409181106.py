Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Summary of Input Column Data

The input data consists of strings that represent phone numbers in a specific format. Each string begins with a country code prefixed with a plus sign ('+'), followed by a space, and then a sequence of digits separated by hyphens into three groups. The format can be summarized as follows: `+<country_code> <group1>-<group2>-<group3>`. The country codes and the digit groups vary in length across the dataset, indicating a diversity in the origin or type of these phone numbers. The first group after the country code appears to represent an area or a specific telecommunication circle, the second group could be an intermediary code or a specific operator's identifier, and the third group seems to be a unique identifier for the individual subscriber.

### Summary of Output Column Data

The output data consists of integers extracted from the third group of digits in the input strings, which, as mentioned earlier, seem to act as a unique identifier for the individual subscriber. These integers range from 238 to 856 in the provided dataset, indicating a wide range of these unique identifiers. There is no apparent pattern or sequence to these numbers, suggesting that they are randomly assigned or follow a system that is not discernible from the given data alone.

### Relationship Between Input and Output

The relationship between the input and output data is straightforward: the output is directly extracted from the input, specifically from the last group of digits in the input string. This relationship indicates that the focus of the output is on the unique subscriber identifier within the broader context of a phone number. The extraction process ignores the country code and the first two groups of digits, which could represent geographical or operational codes, highlighting only the part of the phone number that is unique to each subscriber. This suggests that the purpose behind this data processing might be to isolate or focus on individual subscriber identifiers for further analysis, tracking, or identification within a larger dataset or system., and input as ['+106 769-858-438'] output is 438, input as ['+83 973-757-831'] output is 831, input as ['+62 647-787-775'] output is 775, input as ['+172 027-507-632'] output is 632, input as ['+72 001-050-856'] output is 856, input as ['+95 310-537-401'] output is 401, input as ['+6 775-969-238'] output is 238, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
