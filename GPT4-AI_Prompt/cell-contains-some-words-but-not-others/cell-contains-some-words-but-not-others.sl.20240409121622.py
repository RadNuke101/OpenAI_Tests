Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Input Column Summary:

The input data consists of two parts: a list of strings and a set of color keywords. The first part of the input is a string that describes items or scenarios with associated colors (e.g., 'red ball, green sweater'). This string can contain multiple colors and is not limited to a specific format, as it can describe various objects or scenes. The subsequent parts of the input are individual color keywords (e.g., 'red', 'green', 'pink'). These keywords are consistent across the different inputs, serving as a reference set of colors to be checked against the first part of the input.

### Output Column Summary:

The output is a boolean value (true or false) that seems to be determined by the presence or absence of specific conditions or patterns within the input data. The pattern for determining the output value is not explicitly stated but can be inferred based on the provided examples.

### Relationship Between Input and Output:

The relationship between the input and the output appears to be based on the presence of the color keywords (from the second part of the input) within the first part of the input (the string describing items or scenarios). Specifically, the output is true if all the color keywords are found within the descriptive string, indicating a match for each color mentioned in the keyword list. Conversely, the output is false if at least one of the color keywords is not found within the descriptive string, indicating a mismatch or absence of that particular color in the described items or scenarios.

- When the descriptive string contains all the colors listed in the subsequent parts of the input, the output is true (e.g., 'red ball, green sweater' with keywords 'red', 'green' results in true).
- When the descriptive string does not contain all the colors listed in the subsequent parts of the input, the output is false (e.g., 'pink ball, green sweater' with keywords 'red', 'green', 'pink' results in false).

This relationship suggests that the output serves as an indicator of whether the descriptive string encompasses a complete match with the set of color keywords provided in the input., and input as ['red ball, green sweater', 'red', 'green', 'pink'] output is true, input as ['pink ball, green sweater', 'red', 'green', 'pink'] output is false, input as ['blue sea, pink ribbon', 'red', 'blue', 'pink'] output is false, input as ['black sea, white ribbon', 'red', 'blue', 'pink'] output is false, input as ['red green blue', 'red', 'blue', 'pink'] output is true, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
