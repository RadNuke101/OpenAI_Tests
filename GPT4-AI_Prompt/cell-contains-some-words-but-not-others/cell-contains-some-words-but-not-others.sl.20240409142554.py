Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Input Column Summary:

The input data consists of two parts: a list of phrases and a set of keywords. The phrases are varied, containing descriptions of objects with associated colors (e.g., "red ball, green sweater") or simply combinations of colors (e.g., "red green blue"). These phrases are followed by a consistent set of three keywords across different inputs, which are colors (e.g., "red", "green", "pink").

1. **Phrases**: The phrases are descriptive, mentioning objects and their colors or just color combinations. They serve as the primary subject for evaluation against the set of keywords.
   
2. **Keywords**: The keywords are colors that remain constant in terms of the colors being evaluated (e.g., "red", "green", "pink"), but their presence in the phrases varies. These keywords are crucial for determining the relationship with the output.

### Output Column Summary:

The output is a binary value (true or false) that appears to be determined by the relationship between the phrases and the set of keywords. The output is true if all the keywords are present in the phrase, and false otherwise.

### Relationship Summary:

The relationship between the input and the output is based on the presence of the keywords within the phrases. If all the keywords are found within the phrase, the output is true. If any of the keywords are missing from the phrase, the output is false. This suggests a rule-based logic where the output is contingent upon the complete inclusion of the specified keywords within the given phrase. The process involves a straightforward matching operation where the presence of all keywords within the phrase is mandatory for a true output., and input as ['red ball, green sweater', 'red', 'green', 'pink'] output is true, input as ['pink ball, green sweater', 'red', 'green', 'pink'] output is false, input as ['blue sea, pink ribbon', 'red', 'blue', 'pink'] output is false, input as ['black sea, white ribbon', 'red', 'blue', 'pink'] output is false, input as ['red green blue', 'red', 'blue', 'pink'] output is true, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
