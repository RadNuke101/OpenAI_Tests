Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Input Column Summary:

The input data consists of two parts: a primary string and a set of secondary strings. The primary string describes items or scenarios using color adjectives, such as "red ball, green sweater" or "blue sea, pink ribbon". These primary strings are diverse, featuring various combinations of colors and objects or scenarios. The secondary strings are a list of color adjectives without any associated objects, such as 'red', 'green', 'blue', and 'pink'. These colors appear to be a subset of colors that could potentially be mentioned in the primary string but are not limited to those mentioned in any specific primary string.

### Output Column Summary:

The output data is binary, represented by boolean values true or false. It indicates a specific relationship or condition being met between the primary string and the set of secondary strings in the input data. 

### Relationship Summary:

The relationship between the input and the output can be summarized based on the pattern observed in the given examples. The output is true when all the colors listed in the secondary strings are present in the primary string, regardless of the context in which they appear (i.e., the specific objects or scenarios associated with those colors). Conversely, the output is false when at least one of the colors from the secondary strings is not found in the primary string. This relationship suggests that the output is a direct function of the presence or absence of the specified colors in the primary string, as compared to the list of colors in the secondary strings. 

In essence, the output serves as an indicator of whether the primary string contains a complete match for the set of color adjectives provided in the secondary strings, making it a form of pattern matching or content verification task based on color mentions., and input as ['red ball, green sweater', 'red', 'green', 'pink'] output is true, input as ['pink ball, green sweater', 'red', 'green', 'pink'] output is false, input as ['blue sea, pink ribbon', 'red', 'blue', 'pink'] output is false, input as ['black sea, white ribbon', 'red', 'blue', 'pink'] output is false, input as ['red green blue', 'red', 'blue', 'pink'] output is true, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
