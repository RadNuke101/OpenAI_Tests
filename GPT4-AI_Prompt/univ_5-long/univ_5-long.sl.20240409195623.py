Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Summary of Input Column Data

The input data consists of two columns, each containing information related to various universities and colleges across the United States. The first column lists the names of these institutions, which include a mix of full university names (e.g., "University of Pennsylvania"), abbreviations (e.g., "UCLA" for University of California, Los Angeles), and informal names (e.g., "Penn" for the University of Pennsylvania). This variety suggests a broad representation of how institutions are referred to in both formal and colloquial contexts.

The second column provides the locations of these institutions, presented in a format that includes the city and state. In some cases, the country ("USA") is also included, while in others, it is omitted. This column shows a geographical diversity across the United States, covering both coasts, the Midwest, and the South, indicating a wide representation of American higher education locations.

### Summary of Output Column Data

The output data standardizes the location information provided in the second input column. It ensures consistency in the presentation of each location by including the city, state abbreviation, and the country ("USA") for each institution. This standardization process addresses the variability observed in the input dataâ€”specifically, the occasional omission of the country and the use of different formats for state names (full name vs. abbreviation). The output uniformly abbreviates state names and consistently adds "USA" to all entries, providing a clear and standardized geographical identifier for each institution.

### Relationship Between Input and Output

The transformation from input to output data demonstrates a process of standardization and normalization of location information associated with various higher education institutions in the United States. The primary relationship between the input and output is the refinement and consistency applied to the geographical data. While the input data varies in how locations are presented, the output ensures that each location is uniformly formatted, enhancing readability and comparability. This process does not alter the essential information (i.e., the names of the institutions and their locations) but rather presents it in a more structured and accessible format. This standardization is crucial for various applications, including data analysis, reporting, and mapping of educational institutions across the country., and input as ['University of Pennsylvania', 'Phialdelphia, PA, USA'] output is Phialdelphia, PA, USA, input as ['UCLA', 'Los Angeles, CA'] output is Los Angeles, CA, USA, input as ['Cornell University', 'Ithaca, New York, USA'] output is Ithaca, NY, USA, input as ['Penn', 'Philadelphia, PA, USA'] output is Philadelphia, PA, USA, input as ['University of Maryland College Park', 'College Park, MD'] output is College Park, MD, USA, input as ['University of Michigan', 'Ann Arbor, MI, USA'] output is Ann Arbor, MI, USA, input as ['UC Berkeley', 'Berkeley, CA'] output is Berkeley, CA, USA, input as ['MIT', 'Cambridge, MA'] output is Cambridge, MA, USA, input as ['Rice University', 'Houston, TX'] output is Houston, TX, USA, input as ['Yale University', 'New Haven, CT, USA'] output is New Haven, CT, USA, input as ['Columbia University', 'New York, NY, USA'] output is New York, NY, USA, input as ['NYU', 'New York, New York, USA'] output is New York, NY, USA, input as ['UC Berkeley', 'Berkeley, CA'] output is Berkeley, CA, USA, input as ['UIUC', 'Urbana, IL'] output is Urbana, IL, USA, input as ['Temple University', 'Philadelphia, PA'] output is Philadelphia, PA, USA, input as ['Harvard University', 'Cambridge, MA, USA'] output is Cambridge, MA, USA, input as ['University of Connecticut', 'Storrs, CT, USA'] output is Storrs, CT, USA, input as ['Drexel University', 'Philadelphia, PA'] output is Philadelphia, PA, USA, input as ['New Haven University', 'New Haven, CT, USA'] output is New Haven, CT, USA, input as ['University of California, Santa Barbara', 'Santa Barbara, CA, USA'] output is Santa Barbara, CA, USA, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
