Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Summary of Input Column Data:

The input data consists of two primary columns, each containing specific but related information about various universities in the United States. The first column lists the names of the universities, which include a mix of full university names (e.g., "University of Pennsylvania"), abbreviations (e.g., "UCLA" for University of California, Los Angeles), and informal names (e.g., "Penn" for the University of Pennsylvania). This variety indicates a broad representation of institutions, from Ivy League universities to public state universities and specialized institutions.

The second column provides the geographical location of each university. These locations are expressed in varying levels of detail, from city and state (e.g., "Los Angeles, CA") to more comprehensive formats that include the country (e.g., "Ithaca, New York, USA"). Some entries contain common abbreviations for states, while others spell out the state name in full. This column highlights the diverse geographic distribution of these institutions across the United States, covering both coasts, the Midwest, and southern states.

### Summary of Output Column Data:

The output data standardizes the format of the geographical locations associated with each university mentioned in the input data. Each output entry follows a consistent format: city, state abbreviation, and country ("USA"), ensuring uniformity and clarity. This standardization addresses variations in the input data, such as the correction of spelling errors (e.g., "Phialdelphia" to "Philadelphia"), the abbreviation of state names (e.g., "New York" to "NY"), and the addition of "USA" to entries that originally omitted the country. The output data effectively homogenizes the geographical information, making it more accessible and easier to understand at a glance.

### Relationship Between Input and Output:

The transformation from the input to the output data reveals a process of standardization and correction aimed at achieving consistency in the representation of university locations. The input data's diversity in naming conventions and geographical detail is streamlined in the output to a uniform format that is concise and immediately recognizable. This process not only enhances the readability of the data but also ensures that the geographical information is accurate and uniformly presented, facilitating easier comparison and reference. The relationship between the input and output underscores the importance of data normalization in conveying information effectively, particularly when dealing with a wide range of entities and details., and input as ['University of Pennsylvania', 'Phialdelphia, PA, USA'] output is Phialdelphia, PA, USA, input as ['UCLA', 'Los Angeles, CA'] output is Los Angeles, CA, USA, input as ['Cornell University', 'Ithaca, New York, USA'] output is Ithaca, NY, USA, input as ['Penn', 'Philadelphia, PA, USA'] output is Philadelphia, PA, USA, input as ['University of Maryland College Park', 'College Park, MD'] output is College Park, MD, USA, input as ['University of Michigan', 'Ann Arbor, MI, USA'] output is Ann Arbor, MI, USA, input as ['UC Berkeley', 'Berkeley, CA'] output is Berkeley, CA, USA, input as ['MIT', 'Cambridge, MA'] output is Cambridge, MA, USA, input as ['Rice University', 'Houston, TX'] output is Houston, TX, USA, input as ['Yale University', 'New Haven, CT, USA'] output is New Haven, CT, USA, input as ['Columbia University', 'New York, NY, USA'] output is New York, NY, USA, input as ['NYU', 'New York, New York, USA'] output is New York, NY, USA, input as ['UC Berkeley', 'Berkeley, CA'] output is Berkeley, CA, USA, input as ['UIUC', 'Urbana, IL'] output is Urbana, IL, USA, input as ['Temple University', 'Philadelphia, PA'] output is Philadelphia, PA, USA, input as ['Harvard University', 'Cambridge, MA, USA'] output is Cambridge, MA, USA, input as ['University of Connecticut', 'Storrs, CT, USA'] output is Storrs, CT, USA, input as ['Drexel University', 'Philadelphia, PA'] output is Philadelphia, PA, USA, input as ['New Haven University', 'New Haven, CT, USA'] output is New Haven, CT, USA, input as ['University of California, Santa Barbara', 'Santa Barbara, CA, USA'] output is Santa Barbara, CA, USA, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
