Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Summary of Input Column Data

The input data consists of two columns, each containing information related to various universities and colleges across the United States. The first column lists the names of the institutions, which include a mix of full university names (e.g., "University of Pennsylvania"), abbreviations (e.g., "UCLA" for University of California, Los Angeles), and informal names (e.g., "Penn" for the University of Pennsylvania). This variety indicates a broad representation of higher education institutions, encompassing both public and private entities, and ranging from Ivy League schools to state universities and specialized institutions.

The second column provides the geographical location of these institutions, with varying levels of detail. Some entries include the city and state (e.g., "Los Angeles, CA"), while others add the country ("USA") or use different formats for the state's name (e.g., "New York" vs. "NY"). This column reflects the diverse geographical distribution of higher education institutions across the United States, from major cities like New York and Los Angeles to smaller towns like Ithaca and Urbana.

### Summary of Output Column Data

The output data standardizes the geographical information provided in the second input column. It consistently formats the location as "City, State Abbreviation, USA," ensuring uniformity across all entries. This standardization process includes correcting spelling errors (e.g., "Phialdelphia" to "Philadelphia"), abbreviating state names according to common conventions (e.g., "New York" to "NY"), and appending ", USA" to entries missing the country designation. The output thus provides a clear, concise, and consistent way to identify the location of each institution, facilitating easier recognition and comparison.

### Relationship Between Input and Output

The transformation from input to output data demonstrates a process of standardization and error correction aimed at creating a uniform format for representing the geographical locations of various higher education institutions in the United States. This process involves:

1. **Standardizing State Names**: Converting full state names to their standard two-letter abbreviations.
2. **Correcting Spelling Errors**: Identifying and correcting any spelling mistakes in city names.
3. **Adding Missing Information**: Appending ", USA" to locations missing the country designation to clarify that these institutions are in the United States.
4. **Ensuring Consistency**: Making the format consistent across all entries, which aids in readability and comparison.

This relationship highlights the importance of data cleaning and standardization in enhancing the utility and accessibility of qualitative data, especially when dealing with diverse sources and formats of information., and input as ['University of Pennsylvania', 'Phialdelphia, PA, USA'] output is Phialdelphia, PA, USA, input as ['UCLA', 'Los Angeles, CA'] output is Los Angeles, CA, USA, input as ['Cornell University', 'Ithaca, New York, USA'] output is Ithaca, NY, USA, input as ['Penn', 'Philadelphia, PA, USA'] output is Philadelphia, PA, USA, input as ['University of Maryland College Park', 'College Park, MD'] output is College Park, MD, USA, input as ['University of Michigan', 'Ann Arbor, MI, USA'] output is Ann Arbor, MI, USA, input as ['UC Berkeley', 'Berkeley, CA'] output is Berkeley, CA, USA, input as ['MIT', 'Cambridge, MA'] output is Cambridge, MA, USA, input as ['Rice University', 'Houston, TX'] output is Houston, TX, USA, input as ['Yale University', 'New Haven, CT, USA'] output is New Haven, CT, USA, input as ['Columbia University', 'New York, NY, USA'] output is New York, NY, USA, input as ['NYU', 'New York, New York, USA'] output is New York, NY, USA, input as ['UC Berkeley', 'Berkeley, CA'] output is Berkeley, CA, USA, input as ['UIUC', 'Urbana, IL'] output is Urbana, IL, USA, input as ['Temple University', 'Philadelphia, PA'] output is Philadelphia, PA, USA, input as ['Harvard University', 'Cambridge, MA, USA'] output is Cambridge, MA, USA, input as ['University of Connecticut', 'Storrs, CT, USA'] output is Storrs, CT, USA, input as ['Drexel University', 'Philadelphia, PA'] output is Philadelphia, PA, USA, input as ['New Haven University', 'New Haven, CT, USA'] output is New Haven, CT, USA, input as ['University of California, Santa Barbara', 'Santa Barbara, CA, USA'] output is Santa Barbara, CA, USA, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
