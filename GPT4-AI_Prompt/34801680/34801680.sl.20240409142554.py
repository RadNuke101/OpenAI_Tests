Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Summary for Input Column Data:

The input data consists of strings that represent company names prefixed with a label and an equal sign (e.g., "Name=" or "ame="). The label appears to be intended as "Name" but may sometimes be misspelled or partially omitted, as seen in the example "ame= XYZ Suppliers". The strings follow a consistent format where the label and equal sign act as indicators, separating the prefix from the actual company name. The data is qualitative, representing different entities by their names. These entities are likely businesses or suppliers, as indicated by the examples "ABC Retailers" and "XYZ Suppliers". The variation in the prefix (correct or incorrect label) suggests a need for data cleaning or standardization before extracting meaningful information.

### Summary for Output Column Data:

The output data consists of cleaned and extracted company names from the input data, devoid of any prefix or label. The output is purely qualitative, representing the essence of the input dataâ€”namely, the names of the companies or entities involved. The examples provided, "ABC Retailers" and "XYZ Suppliers", indicate that the output is expected to be clear, concise, and directly usable for further analysis or reporting. The process of generating the output involves stripping away extraneous characters and focusing solely on the meaningful part of the input, which is the company name.

### Relationship Summary between Input and Output:

The relationship between the input and output data is a transformation process that involves cleaning and extracting relevant information. The input data, which includes a mix of labels and company names, undergoes a standardization process to remove any prefixes or labels, leaving only the company names. This transformation is crucial for data usability, making the output more accessible and meaningful for further analysis or application. The process highlights the importance of data cleaning in handling qualitative data, ensuring that the output is free from unnecessary clutter and focuses solely on the core information needed. The relationship underscores a common task in data processing, where raw, unstructured data is refined into a structured and usable form., and input as ['Name= ABC Retailers'] output is ABC Retailers, input as [' ame= XYZ Suppliers'] output is XYZ Suppliers, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
