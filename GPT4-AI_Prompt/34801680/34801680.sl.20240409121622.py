Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Summary of Input Column Data

The input data consists of strings that represent company names prefixed with a label and an equal sign. The label appears to be a variation of the word "Name" but may sometimes be misspelled or partially omitted (e.g., "ame=" instead of "Name="). Each string in the input column follows a similar pattern, where the label and equal sign act as a marker indicating the beginning of the actual company name. The variations in the spelling of the label suggest either typographical errors or inconsistencies in data entry. The companies mentioned in the examples, "ABC Retailers" and "XYZ Suppliers," indicate that the dataset might include a variety of businesses, potentially from different sectors of the economy. The input data is qualitative, focusing on textual information rather than numerical values.

### Summary of Output Column Data

The output data consists of cleaned company names extracted from the input strings. The process of generating the output involves removing the label and equal sign, leaving only the company name. This transformation suggests that the output data is intended to provide a clearer, more concise representation of the company names for further analysis or use. The output retains the qualitative nature of the input but is streamlined to remove unnecessary characters and standardize the format. The examples provided, "ABC Retailers" and "XYZ Suppliers," demonstrate that the output successfully captures the essence of the input data—namely, the names of the companies—without the additional formatting present in the input.

### Relationship Between Input and Output

The relationship between the input and output data is characterized by a process of extraction and cleaning. The input data contains company names embedded within a specific format that includes a label and an equal sign. The output data is derived by identifying and removing these extraneous elements to isolate the company names. This transformation process is crucial for data cleaning and standardization, making the company names more accessible and usable for subsequent analysis or operations. The relationship underscores the importance of preprocessing textual data to enhance its quality and utility. The consistent pattern observed in the input data suggests that an automated process could be effectively applied to generate the output, indicating a systematic approach to data cleaning that could be scaled across a larger dataset., and input as ['Name= ABC Retailers'] output is ABC Retailers, input as [' ame= XYZ Suppliers'] output is XYZ Suppliers, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
