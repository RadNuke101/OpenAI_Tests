Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Summary for Input Column Data:

The input column data consists of strings that represent company names prefixed with a label and an equal sign (e.g., "Name=" or "ame="). The label is intended to denote the attribute being described (in this case, the name of a company), but it appears to have inconsistencies in its representation, such as missing letters (e.g., "ame=" instead of "Name="). Despite this inconsistency in the label, the structure remains relatively consistent, with each entry following a pattern of a label, an equal sign, and then the company name. The data is qualitative, representing textual information about various entities, specifically their names. The entities represented in the input data seem to be from the commercial sector, with examples including retailers and suppliers. The variety in the names suggests a diversity in the types of businesses or sectors represented.

### Summary for Output Column Data:

The output column data consists of cleaned and extracted company names from the input data, with the removal of the label and equal sign. This results in a cleaner, more focused dataset that exclusively contains the names of the companies, such as "ABC Retailers" and "XYZ Suppliers." The output data retains the qualitative nature of the input but is more streamlined and directly usable for purposes that require only the names of the entities without any additional labeling or formatting. This makes the output data more suitable for tasks such as cataloging, indexing, or further analysis where the primary interest is in the entities themselves rather than how they are labeled in the input.

### Relationship Between Input and Output:

The relationship between the input and output data is a transformational one, where the input data undergoes a process of cleaning and extraction to produce the output data. This process involves removing unnecessary or inconsistent labeling and formatting elements to isolate the core information of interest: the company names. The transformation is consistent across the dataset, applying the same cleaning logic to each entry, which suggests a systematic approach to data preparation. This relationship highlights the importance of data cleaning and preparation in making raw data more usable and meaningful for analysis or other applications. The transformation from input to output enhances the clarity and utility of the data, making it more straightforward to work with and apply in various contexts., and input as ['Name= ABC Retailers'] output is ABC Retailers, input as [' ame= XYZ Suppliers'] output is XYZ Suppliers, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
