Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Summary for Input Column Data:

The input data consists of strings that represent company names prefixed with a label and an equal sign. The label appears to be a variation of the word "Name," although it may sometimes be misspelled or partially omitted (e.g., "ame"). Each string in the input column follows a similar pattern, where the label and equal sign serve as indicators before the actual company name. The company names vary and represent different entities, as indicated by examples like "ABC Retailers" and "XYZ Suppliers." The input data is qualitative, focusing on identifying different entities through their names. The variations in the prefix label suggest either a typo or inconsistency in data entry, which does not affect the extraction of the company name.

### Summary for Output Column Data:

The output data consists of strings that represent the names of companies, extracted from the input data. These names are devoid of any prefixes or labels, presenting a cleaner and more focused dataset that highlights the essential information: the company names themselves. The output retains the qualitative nature of the input data but is refined to remove extraneous elements. This makes the output more straightforward and directly useful for purposes that require only the names of the companies, such as indexing, categorization, or further analysis.

### Relationship Between Input and Output:

The relationship between the input and output data is a process of extraction and refinement. The input data contains company names embedded within a structured string that includes unnecessary elements for certain applications (e.g., "Name=" or "ame="). The output data is the result of removing these extraneous elements to isolate and present only the company names. This transformation process highlights a focus on distilling essential information from a more complex dataset. The consistent structure of the input data, despite minor variations, allows for a systematic approach to extracting the company names, indicating that the input was designed with this extraction process in mind. The transformation from input to output demonstrates a clear intent to clean and simplify the data for ease of use and application in contexts where only the company names are relevant., and input as ['Name= ABC Retailers'] output is ABC Retailers, input as [' ame= XYZ Suppliers'] output is XYZ Suppliers, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.

def generated_function(input_string):

    Extracts the company name from the given input string.
    
    The input string is expected to have a prefix label (which could be a variation of the word "Name" with possible misspellings)
    followed by an equal sign, and then the actual company name.
    
    Parameters:
    - input_string (str): The input string containing the label, equal sign, and company name.
    
    Returns:
    - str: The extracted company name without the prefix label and equal sign.
