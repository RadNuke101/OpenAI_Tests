Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Summary for Input Column Data:

The input data consists of two columns, each containing a series of first names and last names, respectively. The first column includes a variety of first names, such as "Launa," "Lakenya," "Brendan," "Bradford," "Rudolf," and "Lara." These names represent a diverse set of origins and genders. The second column contains last names like "Withers," "Edison," "Hage," "Lango," "Akiyama," and "Constable," which similarly showcase a range of backgrounds and ethnicities. The combination of the two columns provides a set of full names, each pairing a given first name with a surname. This pairing is indicative of a standard practice in many cultures of combining a personal name with a family name to form a complete identifier for an individual.

### Summary for Output Column Data:

The output data is a single column that combines the first and last names from the input columns into full names, formatted as "FirstName LastName." This output reflects a conventional way of presenting names in many contexts, such as formal identification, social introductions, and documentation. The output maintains the original order of names as they appear in the input columns, ensuring that each first name is correctly paired with its corresponding last name. The process of combining these names into a single output column simplifies the data structure from two separate columns into one, making it easier to reference and utilize the full names of individuals.

### Relationship Between Input and Output:

The relationship between the input and output data is a transformation process that merges two separate pieces of information (first name and last name) into a single, cohesive unit (full name). This process is straightforward and deterministic, with each row of the input directly corresponding to a row in the output. The transformation does not alter the original names but simply formats them into a more commonly used convention of displaying names. This merging of first and last names into full names is a common practice in data processing, especially when dealing with personal information, as it allows for a more natural and recognizable representation of individuals' identities., and input as ['Launa', 'Withers'] output is Launa Withers, input as ['Lakenya', 'Edison'] output is Lakenya Edison, input as ['Brendan', 'Hage'] output is Brendan Hage, input as ['Bradford', 'Lango'] output is Bradford Lango, input as ['Rudolf', 'Akiyama'] output is Rudolf Akiyama, input as ['Lara', 'Constable'] output is Lara Constable, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
