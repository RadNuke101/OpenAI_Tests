Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Summary for Input Column Data:

The input data consists of two columns, each containing first names and last names, respectively. The first names vary widely in origin and phonetics, indicating a diverse set of individuals. Names like "Launa," "Lakenya," "Brendan," "Bradford," "Rudolf," and "Lara" suggest a mix of cultural backgrounds. Similarly, the last names such as "Withers," "Edison," "Hage," "Lango," "Akiyama," and "Constable" also display a variety of origins, ranging from English to Japanese. This diversity in both columns suggests that the dataset encompasses a broad spectrum of individuals without any apparent bias towards a specific gender, ethnicity, or nationality.

### Summary for Output Column Data:

The output data combines the first and last names from the input columns into full names, presented in a standard "FirstName LastName" format. This transformation from separate entities into a single string per individual facilitates easier identification and reference. The output maintains the diversity and variety observed in the input data, ensuring that the richness of cultural backgrounds is preserved. The process of combining the names does not alter the individual characteristics of each name; instead, it enhances the data's utility for contexts where full names are required, such as in formal documentation, communication, or databases.

### Relationship Summary:

The relationship between the input and output data is a straightforward concatenation process, where the first and last names are merged into complete names. This transformation is consistent across all entries, indicating a uniform approach to handling the data. The primary purpose of this process seems to be the consolidation of fragmented personal information into a more usable and recognizable format. The diversity present in the input is fully retained in the output, highlighting that the process respects and maintains the individuality of each name. This relationship underscores the importance of preserving personal identity while enhancing data organization and readability., and input as ['Launa', 'Withers'] output is Launa Withers, input as ['Lakenya', 'Edison'] output is Lakenya Edison, input as ['Brendan', 'Hage'] output is Brendan Hage, input as ['Bradford', 'Lango'] output is Bradford Lango, input as ['Rudolf', 'Akiyama'] output is Rudolf Akiyama, input as ['Lara', 'Constable'] output is Lara Constable, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.

    This function takes two arguments: first_name and last_name.
    It concatenates these two strings with a space in between to form a full name.
    
    Parameters:
    - first_name (str): The first name of an individual.
    - last_name (str): The last name of an individual.
    
    Returns:
    - str: The full name in the format "FirstName LastName".
