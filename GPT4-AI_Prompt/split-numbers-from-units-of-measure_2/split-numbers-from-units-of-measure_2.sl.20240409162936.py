Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Input Column Summary:

The input data consists of two columns, with each row containing a pair of values. The first value in each pair is a string that combines a numerical value with an alphabetic unit (e.g., '80v', '10hrs', '7h', '500m'), indicating a quantity followed by a unit of measurement or type. The second value in each pair is a numerical string (e.g., '3', '2', '4'), which does not directly correlate with the first value in terms of modifying or affecting it in a mathematical sense but seems to be an independent parameter.

The units of measurement or type in the first value of the pairs include various symbols such as 'v' for volts, 'hrs' for hours, 'h' for hour, and 'm' for meters, suggesting a diversity in the types of measurements or categories being represented. These units are appended to numerical values, indicating quantities or magnitudes associated with these units.

The second value in the pairs appears to be a standalone numerical string, possibly representing a categorization, level, or identifier that does not modify the first value but is associated with it for classification or sorting purposes.

### Output Column Summary:

The output data consists of a single column, with each row containing an alphabetic unit (e.g., 'v', 'hrs', 'h', 'm'). These outputs correspond to the units of measurement or type extracted from the first value in the input pairs. The output effectively isolates and highlights the unit of measurement or type from the combined numerical and alphabetic string in the input, disregarding the numerical value that precedes it.

### Relationship Summary:

The relationship between the input and output data is characterized by the extraction and isolation of the unit of measurement or type from the first value in the input pairs. The output does not take into account the numerical value associated with these units in the input nor does it consider the second value in the input pairs, which is a standalone numerical string. The process seems to focus solely on identifying and extracting the type or unit of measurement from a mixed format, simplifying the input data by removing numerical quantities and leaving only the qualitative descriptors.

This relationship suggests a transformation process aimed at distilling qualitative information (the unit of measurement or type) from a more complex mixed data format, enabling a clearer understanding or categorization of the data based solely on the type of measurement or category represented, without the influence of quantity or additional numerical identifiers., and input as ['80v', '3'] output is v, input as ['10hrs', '3'] output is hrs, input as ['7h', '2'] output is h, input as ['500m', '4'] output is m, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
