Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Summary for Input Column Data:

The input data consists of two columns. The first column contains strings that are a combination of numbers followed by alphabetic characters, representing a quantity and its unit (e.g., '80v', '10hrs', '7h', '500m'). These strings signify measurements in various units, such as voltage ('v'), hours ('hrs'), height or time ('h'), and distance ('m'). The second column contains numbers in string format (e.g., '3', '2', '4'), which do not directly correlate with the measurements or units in the first column but seem to be an independent variable or a parameter that might influence the processing or interpretation of the first column's data.

### Summary for Output Column Data:

The output data consists of a single column that extracts and presents the unit part of the strings from the first input column, disregarding the numeric part. For every row, the output is the alphabetic characters that follow the numeric value in the first column of the input data (e.g., 'v', 'hrs', 'h', 'm'). This output demonstrates a consistent pattern of isolating and identifying the unit of measurement from a mixed format of numbers and letters.

### Relationship Summary Between Input and Output:

The relationship between the input and output data is characterized by a process of extracting the unit of measurement from a composite string of quantity and unit. The second column in the input data does not appear to influence the output directly, as the output consistently focuses on the alphabetic portion of the first column's data, regardless of the value presented in the second column. This indicates that the transformation from input to output is primarily concerned with identifying and isolating the unit of measurement from the first input column, effectively ignoring the numeric quantity and the entirety of the second input column. The process highlights a method of data simplification and extraction, where the key interest is in understanding the type of measurement (unit) rather than its magnitude or any associated parameter., and input as ['80v', '3'] output is v, input as ['10hrs', '3'] output is hrs, input as ['7h', '2'] output is h, input as ['500m', '4'] output is m, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
