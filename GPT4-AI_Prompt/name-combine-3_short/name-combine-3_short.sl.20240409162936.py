Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Summary of Input Column Data:

The input data consists of two columns, each containing a list of names. The first column contains given names, while the second column contains surnames. The given names are diverse, including both traditionally male and female names, indicating a variety of individuals. The surnames also show diversity, suggesting a range of ethnic and cultural backgrounds. The names in both columns are primarily Western or have been adapted to fit English phonetics, which might reflect a certain demographic or geographical focus. The given names are unique in each row, as are the surnames, with no repetitions observed in the provided dataset.

### Summary of Output Column Data:

The output data combines elements from both input columns into a single string per row, following a specific format: the initial of the given name followed by a period and a space, and then the surname. This format standardizes the way names are presented, reducing them to a more formal or professional representation. The output retains the full surname while abbreviating the given name to its initial, which could suggest an emphasis on the family name or a cultural preference for formality in certain contexts. The output is consistent across all examples, indicating a systematic approach to transforming the input data into a standardized naming convention.

### Relationship Between Input and Output:

The relationship between the input and output data is a transformation process that abbreviates the given name to its initial and retains the full surname, combining them into a single, more formal representation. This process suggests a standardization of names, possibly for use in environments where space is limited or where formal identification is preferred, such as in professional settings, academic publications, or databases. The transformation highlights the surname, which could be significant in cultures or contexts where the family name holds particular importance or where individual identity is strongly tied to family lineage. The systematic nature of the transformation suggests that it could be easily automated for large datasets, making it a useful tool for organizing and presenting names in a consistent format., and input as ['Launa', 'Withers'] output is L. Withers, input as ['Lakenya', 'Edison'] output is L. Edison, input as ['Brendan', 'Hage'] output is B. Hage, input as ['Bradford', 'Lango'] output is B. Lango, input as ['Rudolf', 'Akiyama'] output is R. Akiyama, input as ['Lara', 'Constable'] output is L. Constable, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
