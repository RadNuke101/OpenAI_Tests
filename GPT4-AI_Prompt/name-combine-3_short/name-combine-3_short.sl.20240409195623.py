Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Input Column Summary:

The input data consists of two columns, each containing a list of names. The first column includes given names, while the second column contains surnames. The given names are diverse, ranging from common to less common names, and include both male and female names. The surnames also show a variety of origins, indicating a multicultural dataset. The names in both columns are capitalized, suggesting a standard format for proper nouns.

### Output Column Summary:

The output data combines elements from both input columns into a single string per row, following a specific format: the initial of the given name followed by a period and a space, then the full surname. This format standardizes the way names are presented, making it concise and formal. The output retains the capitalization from the input, ensuring that the proper noun format is consistent.

### Relationship Summary:

The transformation from the input to the output columns demonstrates a process of abbreviation and combination. The relationship between the input and output is defined by a rule that extracts the first letter of the given name from the first column, adds a period and a space, and then appends the full surname from the second column. This process suggests a focus on maintaining the identity and recognizability of the individuals through their surnames, while simplifying and standardizing the presentation of their given names to just initials. This could be particularly useful in contexts where space is limited or where a more formal, uniform presentation of names is required, such as in professional listings, academic citations, or databases., and input as ['Launa', 'Withers'] output is L. Withers, input as ['Lakenya', 'Edison'] output is L. Edison, input as ['Brendan', 'Hage'] output is B. Hage, input as ['Bradford', 'Lango'] output is B. Lango, input as ['Rudolf', 'Akiyama'] output is R. Akiyama, input as ['Lara', 'Constable'] output is L. Constable, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
