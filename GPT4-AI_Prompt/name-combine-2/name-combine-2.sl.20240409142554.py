Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Input Column Data Summary:

The input data consists of two columns, each representing a different type of qualitative information about individuals:

1. **First Name Column**: This column contains the first names of individuals. The data within this column is purely textual and represents a variety of first names without any apparent pattern or restriction regarding culture, origin, or gender. The names provided in the examples, such as 'Nancy', 'Andrew', 'Jan', and 'Mariya', indicate a diverse set of names, suggesting the dataset might include a wide range of individuals from different backgrounds.

2. **Last Name Column**: Similar to the first name column, this column contains the last names of individuals, also in a textual format. The last names, such as 'FreeHafer', 'Cencici', 'Kotas', and 'Sergienko', further indicate a diversity in the dataset, pointing to a variety of cultural and ethnic backgrounds. This column, like the first name column, does not follow any specific pattern and is qualitative in nature.

### Output Column Data Summary:

The output data is a single column that combines elements from both input columns (first name and the initial of the last name) followed by a period. This output is also qualitative and textual but is derived from a specific transformation of the input data. Each entry in the output column takes the full first name from the first input column and the initial of the last name from the second input column, creating a concise representation of the individual's name. For example, 'Nancy FreeHafer' becomes 'Nancy F.', 'Andrew Cencici' becomes 'Andrew C.', and so on. This transformation suggests a standardization or simplification of the input data for purposes that might include privacy, ease of identification, or data uniformity.

### Relationship Between Input and Output:

The relationship between the input columns and the output column is a transformational one, where the output is directly derived from the input data through a specific process. This process involves concatenating the first name (unchanged) with the initial of the last name, followed by a period. This transformation indicates a methodical approach to standardize or simplify the representation of names, possibly for applications where full last names are unnecessary, or privacy is a concern. The process respects the integrity of the first name while abbreviating the last name to its initial, thus maintaining a level of personal identification while also introducing a degree of anonymity or brevity. This relationship showcases a practical application of data manipulation to meet specific requirements or constraints within a dataset., and input as ['Nancy', 'FreeHafer'] output is Nancy F., input as ['Andrew', 'Cencici'] output is Andrew C., input as ['Jan', 'Kotas'] output is Jan K., input as ['Mariya', 'Sergienko'] output is Mariya S., , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.

# The outputs can be checked against the expected values as described in the prompt.
print(generated_function("Nancy", "FreeHafer"))  ## Output: Nancy F.
print(generated_function("Andrew", "Cencici"))  ## Output: Andrew C.
