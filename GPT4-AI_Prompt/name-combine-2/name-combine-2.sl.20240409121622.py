Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Input Column Summary:

The input data consists of two columns, each containing qualitative, personal information. The first column includes first names, while the second column contains last names. The names represent a diverse set of origins, indicating a variety of cultural backgrounds. The first names are single-word entries, showcasing a range of common and possibly unique names. The last names also follow this pattern, with each entry being a single word. This structure suggests that the data is likely related to individuals' identities, possibly collected for a database, a study, or for illustrative purposes in demonstrating a process.

### Output Column Summary:

The output data is a single column that combines elements from both input columns to generate a new format of personal identification. The format consists of the full first name from the first input column and the initial of the last name from the second input column, followed by a period. This transformation suggests a standardized way of representing names, possibly for privacy reasons, to maintain some level of anonymity, or for simplification in a specific context (e.g., a professional setting, software application, or documentation).

### Relationship Summary:

The relationship between the input and output columns is a process of transformation and standardization of personal names. The output is generated by taking the full first name from the first input column and appending the initial of the last name from the second input column, followed by a period. This process indicates a method of creating a uniform representation of names while still retaining enough information to distinguish between individuals. It could be used in contexts where full last names are unnecessary, or privacy is a concern, but there is still a need to maintain a level of personal identification that is more formal than just a first name. This method simplifies the data while keeping it informative and somewhat personal, making it suitable for various applications, including databases, communication platforms, and documentation., and input as ['Nancy', 'FreeHafer'] output is Nancy F., input as ['Andrew', 'Cencici'] output is Andrew C., input as ['Jan', 'Kotas'] output is Jan K., input as ['Mariya', 'Sergienko'] output is Mariya S., , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
