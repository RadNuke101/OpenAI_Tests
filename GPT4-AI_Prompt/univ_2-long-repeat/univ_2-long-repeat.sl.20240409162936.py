Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Summary of Input Data

The input data consists of pairs of strings, where each pair includes the name of a university or college and its corresponding location. These locations are primarily within the United States, as indicated by city and state abbreviations. The universities and colleges listed vary widely in terms of their geographical distribution, covering both coasts, the Midwest, and the southern United States. The names of the institutions range from well-known public research universities (e.g., UC Berkeley, University of Michigan) to prestigious private universities (e.g., Harvard University, Yale University), including both abbreviated names (e.g., MIT, NYU) and full names (e.g., University of California, Santa Barbara, Columbia University). The locations provided with each institution's name are sometimes specific to the city and state, while at other times, they also include "USA" to denote the country.

### Summary of Output Data

The output data retains the format of the input data but standardizes the location information by ensuring that "USA" is appended to each entry, regardless of whether it was included in the original input. This adjustment creates a uniform presentation of the geographical information associated with each institution. The output effectively addresses any inconsistencies in the representation of the location data from the input, providing a clear and consistent format that specifies each institution is located within the United States. The output data mirrors the diversity and geographical spread of the institutions as seen in the input, but with enhanced clarity regarding the country in which these institutions are located.

### Relationship Between Input and Output

The transformation from input to output data involves a standardization process focused on the geographical information associated with each educational institution. While the names of the institutions remain unchanged, the location data is uniformly appended with ", USA" when this detail is missing in the input. This process ensures that each entry in the output clearly indicates the institution's location within the United States, addressing any ambiguity or inconsistency present in the input data. The relationship between the input and output data underscores a methodical approach to enhancing data uniformity and clarity, particularly concerning the geographical context of each listed institution., and input as ['UC Berkeley', 'Berkeley, CA'] output is UC Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA, input as ['University of Pennsylvania', 'Phialdelphia, PA, USA'] output is University of Pennsylvania, Phialdelphia, PA, USA, input as ['UCLA', 'Los Angeles, CA'] output is UCLA, Los Angeles, CA, USA, input as ['Cornell University', 'Ithaca, New York, USA'] output is Cornell University, Ithaca, New York, USA, input as ['Penn', 'Philadelphia, PA, USA'] output is Penn, Philadelphia, PA, USA, input as ['University of Michigan', 'Ann Arbor, MI, USA'] output is University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA, input as ['UC Berkeley', 'Berkeley, CA'] output is UC Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA, input as ['MIT', 'Cambridge, MA'] output is MIT, Cambridge, MA, USA, input as ['University of Pennsylvania', 'Phialdelphia, PA, USA'] output is University of Pennsylvania, Phialdelphia, PA, USA, input as ['UCLA', 'Los Angeles, CA'] output is UCLA, Los Angeles, CA, USA, input as ['University of Maryland College Park', 'College Park, MD'] output is University of Maryland College Park, College Park, MD, USA, input as ['University of Michigan', 'Ann Arbor, MI, USA'] output is University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA, input as ['UC Berkeley', 'Berkeley, CA'] output is UC Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA, input as ['MIT', 'Cambridge, MA'] output is MIT, Cambridge, MA, USA, input as ['Rice University', 'Houston, TX'] output is Rice University, Houston, TX, USA, input as ['Yale University', 'New Haven, CT, USA'] output is Yale University, New Haven, CT, USA, input as ['Columbia University', 'New York, NY, USA'] output is Columbia University, New York, NY, USA, input as ['NYU', 'New York, New York, USA'] output is NYU, New York, New York, USA, input as ['Drexel University', 'Philadelphia, PA'] output is Drexel University, Philadelphia, PA, USA, input as ['UC Berkeley', 'Berkeley, CA'] output is UC Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA, input as ['UIUC', 'Urbana, IL'] output is UIUC, Urbana, IL, USA, input as ['Temple University', 'Philadelphia, PA'] output is Temple University, Philadelphia, PA, USA, input as ['Harvard University', 'Cambridge, MA, USA'] output is Harvard University, Cambridge, MA, USA, input as ['University of Connecticut', 'Storrs, CT, USA'] output is University of Connecticut, Storrs, CT, USA, input as ['Drexel University', 'Philadelphia, PA'] output is Drexel University, Philadelphia, PA, USA, input as ['NYU', 'New York, New York, USA'] output is NYU, New York, New York, USA, input as ['UIUC', 'Urbana, IL'] output is UIUC, Urbana, IL, USA, input as ['New Haven University', 'New Haven, CT, USA'] output is New Haven University, New Haven, CT, USA, input as ['University of California, Santa Barbara', 'Santa Barbara, CA, USA'] output is University of California, Santa Barbara, Santa Barbara, CA, USA, input as ['University of Connecticut', 'Storrs, CT, USA'] output is University of Connecticut, Storrs, CT, USA, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
