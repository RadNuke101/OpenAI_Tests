Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Input Column Summary:

The input data consists of two columns, each containing strings. The first column lists the names of various educational institutions, primarily universities and colleges located in the United States. These include a mix of public and private institutions, ranging from large research universities to smaller colleges. The names are provided in both full form (e.g., "University of California, Berkeley") and abbreviated form (e.g., "UCLA" for University of California, Los Angeles).

The second column provides the geographical location of these institutions, specified by the city and state abbreviation. In some instances, the country "USA" is also included in the location. The locations span a wide range of cities and states, reflecting the diverse geographical distribution of higher education institutions across the United States.

### Output Column Summary:

The output data combines the information from the two input columns into a single string for each entry, formatted as "Institution Name, City, State, USA". If the country was already included in the input, it is retained in the output; otherwise, ", USA" is appended to ensure consistency in indicating that all these institutions are located in the United States. This standardized format provides a clear and concise way to present the name and location of each institution, making it easy to understand the geographical context of each university or college.

### Relationship Summary:

The transformation from the input columns to the output column demonstrates a process of data standardization and consolidation. By merging the institution names with their respective locations into a single, uniform format, the output makes it easier to recognize and comprehend the information at a glance. This process highlights the importance of consistency in data presentation, especially when dealing with qualitative data that involves names and locations. The addition of ", USA" to entries missing the country in the input ensures that all entries are understood to be located in the United States, addressing any potential ambiguity that might arise from the omission of the country in some of the input data., and input as ['UC Berkeley', 'Berkeley, CA'] output is UC Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA, input as ['University of Pennsylvania', 'Phialdelphia, PA, USA'] output is University of Pennsylvania, Phialdelphia, PA, USA, input as ['UCLA', 'Los Angeles, CA'] output is UCLA, Los Angeles, CA, USA, input as ['Cornell University', 'Ithaca, New York, USA'] output is Cornell University, Ithaca, New York, USA, input as ['Penn', 'Philadelphia, PA, USA'] output is Penn, Philadelphia, PA, USA, input as ['University of Michigan', 'Ann Arbor, MI, USA'] output is University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA, input as ['UC Berkeley', 'Berkeley, CA'] output is UC Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA, input as ['MIT', 'Cambridge, MA'] output is MIT, Cambridge, MA, USA, input as ['University of Pennsylvania', 'Phialdelphia, PA, USA'] output is University of Pennsylvania, Phialdelphia, PA, USA, input as ['UCLA', 'Los Angeles, CA'] output is UCLA, Los Angeles, CA, USA, input as ['University of Maryland College Park', 'College Park, MD'] output is University of Maryland College Park, College Park, MD, USA, input as ['University of Michigan', 'Ann Arbor, MI, USA'] output is University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA, input as ['UC Berkeley', 'Berkeley, CA'] output is UC Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA, input as ['MIT', 'Cambridge, MA'] output is MIT, Cambridge, MA, USA, input as ['Rice University', 'Houston, TX'] output is Rice University, Houston, TX, USA, input as ['Yale University', 'New Haven, CT, USA'] output is Yale University, New Haven, CT, USA, input as ['Columbia University', 'New York, NY, USA'] output is Columbia University, New York, NY, USA, input as ['NYU', 'New York, New York, USA'] output is NYU, New York, New York, USA, input as ['Drexel University', 'Philadelphia, PA'] output is Drexel University, Philadelphia, PA, USA, input as ['UC Berkeley', 'Berkeley, CA'] output is UC Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA, input as ['UIUC', 'Urbana, IL'] output is UIUC, Urbana, IL, USA, input as ['Temple University', 'Philadelphia, PA'] output is Temple University, Philadelphia, PA, USA, input as ['Harvard University', 'Cambridge, MA, USA'] output is Harvard University, Cambridge, MA, USA, input as ['University of Connecticut', 'Storrs, CT, USA'] output is University of Connecticut, Storrs, CT, USA, input as ['Drexel University', 'Philadelphia, PA'] output is Drexel University, Philadelphia, PA, USA, input as ['NYU', 'New York, New York, USA'] output is NYU, New York, New York, USA, input as ['UIUC', 'Urbana, IL'] output is UIUC, Urbana, IL, USA, input as ['New Haven University', 'New Haven, CT, USA'] output is New Haven University, New Haven, CT, USA, input as ['University of California, Santa Barbara', 'Santa Barbara, CA, USA'] output is University of California, Santa Barbara, Santa Barbara, CA, USA, input as ['University of Connecticut', 'Storrs, CT, USA'] output is University of Connecticut, Storrs, CT, USA, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
