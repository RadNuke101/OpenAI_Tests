Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Summary for Input Column Data:

The input data consists of a series of full names, each entry comprising primarily of two parts: a given name (commonly referred to as a first name) and a surname (often called a last name). These names appear to be of diverse ethnic origins, indicating a variety of cultural backgrounds. Each entry is presented in a format where the given name precedes the surname, and both are separated by a space. The names are encapsulated within a list, with each name being a single string element of that list. The data does not include middle names or initials, focusing solely on the primary components of a person's name. The diversity in the names suggests a broad representation, potentially aiming to cover a wide range of name structures and cultural naming conventions.

### Summary for Output Column Data:

The output data extracts and presents the given name from each full name entry provided in the input data. This process simplifies the information by isolating the first element of each name, which is the given name, and discarding the surname. The output retains the original format of the given names, without alterations to capitalization or structure. This distilled information highlights the focus on individuals' given names, disregarding their family or cultural lineage represented by their surnames.

### Relationship Summary between Input and Output:

The relationship between the input and output data is characterized by a systematic extraction process where the given name from each full name in the input is isolated and presented as the output. This transformation underscores a selective emphasis on personal identity as represented by given names, while omitting the aspect of familial or cultural identity conveyed through surnames. The process signifies a filtering of personal information, narrowing down the scope from a complete identification marker to a more casual and personal identifier. This could reflect applications or contexts where the individual's given name is of primary importance, such as in informal settings, user interfaces requiring first names for personalization, or scenarios where the uniqueness of a full name is unnecessary. The methodology suggests a consistent rule-based approach, likely automated, to handle names of varying lengths and structures, ensuring the first element—the given name—is accurately identified and extracted across diverse name formats., and input as ['Nancy FreeHafer'] output is Nancy, input as ['Andrew Cencici'] output is Andrew, input as ['Jan Kotas'] output is Jan, input as ['Mariya Sergienko'] output is Mariya, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
