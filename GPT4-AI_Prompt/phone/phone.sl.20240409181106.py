Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Input Column Summary:

The input data consists of strings formatted as three groups of three digits each, separated by hyphens (e.g., '938-242-504'). Each string appears to represent a unique identifier or code, possibly following a specific pattern or structure that is not immediately discernible from the provided examples alone. The first group of digits in each string varies, while the structure (three digits, hyphen, three digits, hyphen, three digits) remains consistent across all examples.

### Output Column Summary:

The output data consists of the first group of three digits extracted from each input string (e.g., from '938-242-504' to 938). This suggests a direct relationship between the input and output, where the output is specifically derived from a portion of the input data. The output is presented as a numeric value, stripped of any formatting present in the input.

### Relationship Summary:

The relationship between the input and output data is straightforward: the output is generated by extracting the first group of three digits from the input string. This process effectively isolates the initial segment of each input string as the relevant output, disregarding the rest of the input data. The transformation from input to output involves both a reduction in the data (from a string containing three groups of digits to a single numeric value) and a removal of the formatting (hyphens are not present in the output).

This relationship indicates that, within the context of this dataset, the most significant portion of the input data (for the purpose of generating the output) is the first group of three digits. The remaining digits and the specific formatting of the input do not influence the output. This could imply that the first group of digits holds specific importance or value distinct from the rest of the input string, at least in terms of how the output is determined., and input as ['938-242-504'] output is 938, input as ['308-916-545'] output is 308, input as ['623-599-749'] output is 623, input as ['981-424-843'] output is 981, input as ['118-980-214'] output is 118, input as ['244-655-094'] output is 244, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
