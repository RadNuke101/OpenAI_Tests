Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Summary of Input Column Data

The input data consists of strings formatted as three groups of three digits each, separated by hyphens (e.g., 'XXX-XXX-XXX'). Each string appears to represent a unique identifier or code, possibly following a specific pattern or serving a particular categorization purpose. The data is qualitative, representing categories or labels rather than numerical values meant for calculation. The variation in the groups of digits suggests a broad range of identifiers, potentially indicating different classifications or types within the dataset.

### Summary of Output Column Data

The output data for each input string is the first group of three digits from the corresponding input string (e.g., for 'XXX-XXX-XXX', the output is 'XXX'). This suggests a direct relationship between the input and output, where the output serves as a simplified identifier or a primary category extracted from the more complex input code. The output data, like the input, is qualitative and represents a subset of the categorization or labeling system implied by the input data.

### Relationship Between Input and Output

The relationship between the input and output data is straightforward: the output is derived directly from the input by extracting the first group of three digits. This extraction process simplifies the input data, reducing it to a primary identifier that might represent a main category, type, or classification level within the broader system suggested by the full input string. The process of deriving the output from the input does not alter the qualitative nature of the data; it merely simplifies or condenses it for potentially easier reference, analysis, or categorization. This relationship indicates a hierarchical or structured approach to the data, where the full input code contains detailed information, and the output provides a high-level classification., and input as ['938-242-504'] output is 938, input as ['308-916-545'] output is 308, input as ['623-599-749'] output is 623, input as ['981-424-843'] output is 981, input as ['118-980-214'] output is 118, input as ['244-655-094'] output is 244, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
