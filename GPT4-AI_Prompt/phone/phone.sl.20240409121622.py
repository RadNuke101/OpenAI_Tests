Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Summary of Input Column Data

The input data consists of strings formatted as three groups of three digits each, separated by hyphens (e.g., '938-242-504'). Each string appears to be unique and does not follow a discernible pattern in terms of the numerical values within each group. The data is qualitative in nature, as it represents a specific format or code rather than a quantity that can be measured or compared in a mathematical sense. The input data can be seen as identifiers or codes that might be used to represent individuals, items, or transactions in a system.

### Summary of Output Column Data

The output data consists of the first group of three digits from the input data (e.g., for '938-242-504', the output is 938). This suggests a direct relationship between the input and output, where the output is derived by extracting a specific portion of the input data. The output, like the input, is treated as qualitative data because it represents a part of the code or identifier rather than a numerical value meant for calculation. Each output is unique and corresponds directly to its respective input.

### Relationship Between Input and Output

The relationship between the input and output data is straightforward: the output is always the first group of three digits from the input string. This indicates a process of selection or extraction where only a specific part of the input data is of interest for the output. The process does not alter the numerical values but rather isolates a segment of the input for use as the output. This could be indicative of a system where the full input code contains information not needed for certain operations or analyses, and thus, only a relevant portion is extracted and utilized. 

In summary, the relationship is characterized by a consistent method of deriving the output from the input, focusing on the first segment of the input data as the significant portion for the output. This suggests a structured approach to handling the data, possibly for simplification, categorization, or identification purposes within a larger system or process., and input as ['938-242-504'] output is 938, input as ['308-916-545'] output is 308, input as ['623-599-749'] output is 623, input as ['981-424-843'] output is 981, input as ['118-980-214'] output is 118, input as ['244-655-094'] output is 244, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
