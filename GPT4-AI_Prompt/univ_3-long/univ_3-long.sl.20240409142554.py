Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Input Column Summary:

The input data consists of two primary elements: the name of a university or college and its corresponding location. These educational institutions are diverse, ranging from large, well-known universities such as the University of Pennsylvania, UCLA, and Harvard University, to more specialized or less globally recognized institutions like Rice University and New Haven University. The locations provided alongside these institutions vary in detail, with some entries including just the city and state (e.g., 'Los Angeles, CA'), while others provide a more comprehensive address that includes the country (e.g., 'Cambridge, MA, USA'). This variation suggests a lack of standardization in how location information is presented. The universities and colleges mentioned are predominantly based in the United States, covering a wide geographic spread from the East Coast (e.g., Columbia University in New York, NY) to the West Coast (e.g., UC Berkeley in Berkeley, CA), and including various states in between.

### Output Column Summary:

The output data standardizes the location information of the universities and colleges mentioned in the input data. It appears to follow a consistent format, ensuring that each entry includes the city, state abbreviation, and the country 'USA', even if the original input did not specify the country. This standardization process addresses the inconsistency observed in the input data, making the location information more uniform and presumably easier to understand or process for subsequent uses. The output retains the essential location details (city and state) and appends 'USA' to locations that lacked this detail in the input, thereby clarifying that all these institutions are located in the United States.

### Relationship Between Input and Output:

The relationship between the input and output data involves a process of standardization and clarification of location information associated with various universities and colleges. The output corrects any inconsistencies or omissions in the input data regarding the specification of the country, ensuring that each entry is clearly identified as being in the United States. This transformation suggests an underlying goal of making the data more accessible or usable for purposes that require uniformity in location details, such as mapping, analysis of educational institutions by geography, or compiling directories where consistency in data presentation is crucial., and input as ['University of Pennsylvania', 'Phialdelphia, PA, USA'] output is Phialdelphia, PA, USA, input as ['UCLA', 'Los Angeles, CA'] output is Los Angeles, CA, USA, input as ['Cornell University', 'Ithaca, New York, USA'] output is Ithaca, New York, USA, input as ['Penn', 'Philadelphia, PA, USA'] output is Philadelphia, PA, USA, input as ['University of Maryland College Park', 'College Park, MD'] output is College Park, MD, USA, input as ['University of Michigan', 'Ann Arbor, MI, USA'] output is Ann Arbor, MI, USA, input as ['UC Berkeley', 'Berkeley, CA'] output is Berkeley, CA, USA, input as ['MIT', 'Cambridge, MA'] output is Cambridge, MA, USA, input as ['Rice University', 'Houston, TX'] output is Houston, TX, USA, input as ['Yale University', 'New Haven, CT, USA'] output is New Haven, CT, USA, input as ['Columbia University', 'New York, NY, USA'] output is New York, NY, USA, input as ['NYU', 'New York, New York, USA'] output is New York, New York, USA, input as ['UC Berkeley', 'Berkeley, CA'] output is Berkeley, CA, USA, input as ['UIUC', 'Urbana, IL'] output is Urbana, IL, USA, input as ['Temple University', 'Philadelphia, PA'] output is Philadelphia, PA, USA, input as ['Harvard University', 'Cambridge, MA, USA'] output is Cambridge, MA, USA, input as ['University of Connecticut', 'Storrs, CT, USA'] output is Storrs, CT, USA, input as ['Drexel University', 'Philadelphia, PA'] output is Philadelphia, PA, USA, input as ['New Haven University', 'New Haven, CT, USA'] output is New Haven, CT, USA, input as ['University of California, Santa Barbara', 'Santa Barbara, CA, USA'] output is Santa Barbara, CA, USA, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
