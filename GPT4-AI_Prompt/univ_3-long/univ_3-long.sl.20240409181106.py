Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Summary of Input Column Data

The input data consists of two columns, each containing specific information about various universities and colleges across the United States. The first column lists the names of the institutions, which include a mix of full university names (e.g., "University of Pennsylvania"), abbreviations (e.g., "UCLA" for University of California, Los Angeles), and informal names or nicknames (e.g., "Penn" for the University of Pennsylvania). This variety indicates a broad representation of how institutions can be referred to in different contexts, ranging from formal academic settings to casual conversation.

The second column provides the geographic locations of these institutions, specified by the city and state. In some cases, the country ("USA") is also included, while in others, it is omitted. This column showcases a wide geographical distribution of higher education institutions across the United States, from the East Coast (e.g., "Philadelphia, PA") to the West Coast (e.g., "Berkeley, CA"), and from the North (e.g., "Ithaca, New York") to the South (e.g., "Houston, TX"). The variation in specifying the country suggests an assumption of common knowledge that these cities and states are in the USA, with the explicit mention of the country perhaps serving to clarify for an international audience.

### Summary of Output Column Data

The output data standardizes the format of the geographic locations associated with each institution from the input data. It consistently includes the city and state, followed by ", USA" to explicitly denote the country, even when the original input did not specify it. This standardization process ensures clarity and uniformity across the dataset, making it clear that all these institutions are located within the United States. The output corrects minor spelling errors (e.g., "Phialdelphia" to "Philadelphia") and maintains the original city and state information while adding the country designation where it was missing. This approach facilitates a more straightforward understanding of the geographic distribution of these institutions and aligns with conventions for addressing locations within an international context.

### Relationship Between Input and Output

The transformation from input to output data demonstrates a process of standardization and clarification of geographic information related to various higher education institutions in the United States. By adjusting the format to consistently include the city, state, and country, and by correcting spelling errors, the output makes the data more accessible and interpretable, especially for audiences who may not be familiar with the nuances of U.S. geography or the informal ways institutions are referred to. This process underscores the importance of clear and standardized data presentation in conveying information about the diverse landscape of higher education across the United States., and input as ['University of Pennsylvania', 'Phialdelphia, PA, USA'] output is Phialdelphia, PA, USA, input as ['UCLA', 'Los Angeles, CA'] output is Los Angeles, CA, USA, input as ['Cornell University', 'Ithaca, New York, USA'] output is Ithaca, New York, USA, input as ['Penn', 'Philadelphia, PA, USA'] output is Philadelphia, PA, USA, input as ['University of Maryland College Park', 'College Park, MD'] output is College Park, MD, USA, input as ['University of Michigan', 'Ann Arbor, MI, USA'] output is Ann Arbor, MI, USA, input as ['UC Berkeley', 'Berkeley, CA'] output is Berkeley, CA, USA, input as ['MIT', 'Cambridge, MA'] output is Cambridge, MA, USA, input as ['Rice University', 'Houston, TX'] output is Houston, TX, USA, input as ['Yale University', 'New Haven, CT, USA'] output is New Haven, CT, USA, input as ['Columbia University', 'New York, NY, USA'] output is New York, NY, USA, input as ['NYU', 'New York, New York, USA'] output is New York, New York, USA, input as ['UC Berkeley', 'Berkeley, CA'] output is Berkeley, CA, USA, input as ['UIUC', 'Urbana, IL'] output is Urbana, IL, USA, input as ['Temple University', 'Philadelphia, PA'] output is Philadelphia, PA, USA, input as ['Harvard University', 'Cambridge, MA, USA'] output is Cambridge, MA, USA, input as ['University of Connecticut', 'Storrs, CT, USA'] output is Storrs, CT, USA, input as ['Drexel University', 'Philadelphia, PA'] output is Philadelphia, PA, USA, input as ['New Haven University', 'New Haven, CT, USA'] output is New Haven, CT, USA, input as ['University of California, Santa Barbara', 'Santa Barbara, CA, USA'] output is Santa Barbara, CA, USA, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
