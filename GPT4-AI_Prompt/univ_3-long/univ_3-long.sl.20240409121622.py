Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Summary of Input Column Data:

The input data consists of two primary columns. The first column contains the names of various universities and colleges, which include a mix of full university names (e.g., "University of Pennsylvania"), abbreviations (e.g., "UCLA" for University of California, Los Angeles), and informal names (e.g., "Penn" for the University of Pennsylvania). These institutions are located across the United States, indicating a wide geographical coverage. The second column provides the location of these institutions, including the city and state. In some instances, the country ("USA") is also included, while in others, it is omitted. This column showcases a variety of major cities and towns known for hosting significant academic institutions, from large urban centers like New York, NY, and Los Angeles, CA, to smaller college towns like Ithaca, NY, and Ann Arbor, MI.

### Summary of Output Column Data:

The output data standardizes the format of the location information provided in the second input column. It ensures consistency by always including the city, state abbreviation, and the country ("USA") in the output, even if the original input did not specify the country. This standardization process simplifies the location data, making it uniformly formatted across all entries. The output ignores the specific names of the universities and focuses solely on their locations, emphasizing the geographical aspect of the data over the institutional identity.

### Relationship Between Input and Output:

The transformation from input to output demonstrates a process of standardization and simplification of location data associated with various universities and colleges across the United States. While the input data includes both the names of the institutions and their locations with varying levels of detail, the output focuses exclusively on a standardized format of the location information. This process removes any inconsistencies in how the country is represented and ensures that each entry is uniformly formatted, facilitating easier comparison and analysis of the geographical distribution of these institutions. The relationship between the input and output highlights the importance of consistency in data presentation, particularly for geographical information, and showcases the utility of simplifying data for clarity and ease of use., and input as ['University of Pennsylvania', 'Phialdelphia, PA, USA'] output is Phialdelphia, PA, USA, input as ['UCLA', 'Los Angeles, CA'] output is Los Angeles, CA, USA, input as ['Cornell University', 'Ithaca, New York, USA'] output is Ithaca, New York, USA, input as ['Penn', 'Philadelphia, PA, USA'] output is Philadelphia, PA, USA, input as ['University of Maryland College Park', 'College Park, MD'] output is College Park, MD, USA, input as ['University of Michigan', 'Ann Arbor, MI, USA'] output is Ann Arbor, MI, USA, input as ['UC Berkeley', 'Berkeley, CA'] output is Berkeley, CA, USA, input as ['MIT', 'Cambridge, MA'] output is Cambridge, MA, USA, input as ['Rice University', 'Houston, TX'] output is Houston, TX, USA, input as ['Yale University', 'New Haven, CT, USA'] output is New Haven, CT, USA, input as ['Columbia University', 'New York, NY, USA'] output is New York, NY, USA, input as ['NYU', 'New York, New York, USA'] output is New York, New York, USA, input as ['UC Berkeley', 'Berkeley, CA'] output is Berkeley, CA, USA, input as ['UIUC', 'Urbana, IL'] output is Urbana, IL, USA, input as ['Temple University', 'Philadelphia, PA'] output is Philadelphia, PA, USA, input as ['Harvard University', 'Cambridge, MA, USA'] output is Cambridge, MA, USA, input as ['University of Connecticut', 'Storrs, CT, USA'] output is Storrs, CT, USA, input as ['Drexel University', 'Philadelphia, PA'] output is Philadelphia, PA, USA, input as ['New Haven University', 'New Haven, CT, USA'] output is New Haven, CT, USA, input as ['University of California, Santa Barbara', 'Santa Barbara, CA, USA'] output is Santa Barbara, CA, USA, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
