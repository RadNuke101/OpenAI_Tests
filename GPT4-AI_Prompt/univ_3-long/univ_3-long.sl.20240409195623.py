Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Summary of Input Column Data:

The input data consists of two columns, each containing qualitative information related to universities in the United States. The first column lists the names of various universities, including both full names and abbreviations. These universities represent a wide range of institutions across the country, from Ivy League schools like Yale University and Harvard University to large state universities such as the University of Michigan and the University of California campuses. The diversity in the names also includes technical institutes like MIT and specialized universities like Rice University.

The second column provides the location of these universities, including the city and state. In some instances, the country (USA) is also included, while in others, it is omitted. This column shows a geographical spread across different states such as California, Pennsylvania, New York, and Texas, among others. The cities mentioned range from large metropolitan areas like New York City and Los Angeles to smaller college towns like Ithaca and Ann Arbor.

### Summary of Output Column Data:

The output data is a standardized format of the university locations from the second column of the input data. Each entry in the output data includes the city, state abbreviation, and the country (USA), ensuring a consistent format across all entries. This standardization addresses the inconsistency in the input data where some locations did not include the country. The output data maintains the geographical diversity seen in the input, covering a wide range of locations across the United States.

### Relationship Between Input and Output:

The relationship between the input and output data lies in the transformation of the university locations from a potentially inconsistent format to a standardized one. The output directly derives from the second column of the input data, focusing solely on the geographical information and ensuring uniformity in how this information is presented. This process highlights the importance of consistency in data presentation, especially when dealing with qualitative data that may originally come in various formats. The transformation does not alter the geographical information but rather enhances its clarity and usability by adhering to a consistent format of "City, State, USA". This standardization facilitates easier comparison and analysis of the data across different entries., and input as ['University of Pennsylvania', 'Phialdelphia, PA, USA'] output is Phialdelphia, PA, USA, input as ['UCLA', 'Los Angeles, CA'] output is Los Angeles, CA, USA, input as ['Cornell University', 'Ithaca, New York, USA'] output is Ithaca, New York, USA, input as ['Penn', 'Philadelphia, PA, USA'] output is Philadelphia, PA, USA, input as ['University of Maryland College Park', 'College Park, MD'] output is College Park, MD, USA, input as ['University of Michigan', 'Ann Arbor, MI, USA'] output is Ann Arbor, MI, USA, input as ['UC Berkeley', 'Berkeley, CA'] output is Berkeley, CA, USA, input as ['MIT', 'Cambridge, MA'] output is Cambridge, MA, USA, input as ['Rice University', 'Houston, TX'] output is Houston, TX, USA, input as ['Yale University', 'New Haven, CT, USA'] output is New Haven, CT, USA, input as ['Columbia University', 'New York, NY, USA'] output is New York, NY, USA, input as ['NYU', 'New York, New York, USA'] output is New York, New York, USA, input as ['UC Berkeley', 'Berkeley, CA'] output is Berkeley, CA, USA, input as ['UIUC', 'Urbana, IL'] output is Urbana, IL, USA, input as ['Temple University', 'Philadelphia, PA'] output is Philadelphia, PA, USA, input as ['Harvard University', 'Cambridge, MA, USA'] output is Cambridge, MA, USA, input as ['University of Connecticut', 'Storrs, CT, USA'] output is Storrs, CT, USA, input as ['Drexel University', 'Philadelphia, PA'] output is Philadelphia, PA, USA, input as ['New Haven University', 'New Haven, CT, USA'] output is New Haven, CT, USA, input as ['University of California, Santa Barbara', 'Santa Barbara, CA, USA'] output is Santa Barbara, CA, USA, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
