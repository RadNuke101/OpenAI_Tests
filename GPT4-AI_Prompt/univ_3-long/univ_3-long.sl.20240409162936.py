Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Summary of Input Column Data:

The input data consists of two primary columns. The first column contains the names of various higher education institutions, including a mix of universities and colleges from across the United States. These institutions range from large, well-known universities such as the University of Pennsylvania, UCLA, and Harvard University, to more specialized or less nationally recognized institutions like Rice University and New Haven University. The names of the institutions are sometimes presented in their full formal titles (e.g., "University of Michigan"), and other times in abbreviated or colloquial forms (e.g., "MIT" for Massachusetts Institute of Technology, "UC Berkeley" for University of California, Berkeley, and "NYU" for New York University).

The second column provides the geographical locations of these institutions, including the city and state. In some cases, the country ("USA") is also explicitly mentioned, while in others, it is omitted, presumably because the context of the United States is assumed. The format of the geographical information varies, with some entries providing a more detailed address (including the city, state, and country) and others offering a more concise version (just the city and state).

### Summary of Output Column Data:

The output data standardizes the geographical information provided in the second column of the input data. Regardless of how the location was initially presented, the output ensures consistency by always including the city, state abbreviation, and "USA" to denote the country. This standardization process addresses the variability in the input data, where some entries omitted the country or used varying levels of detail in presenting the location. The output effectively normalizes the location data, making it uniformly formatted across all entries.

### Relationship Between Input and Output:

The transformation from input to output demonstrates a process of standardization and normalization of geographical information associated with various higher education institutions in the United States. The primary goal of this process is to ensure that the location data is presented in a consistent and easily understandable format. This involves adding "USA" to entries that lacked a country specification and ensuring that all entries follow the same "City, State, USA" format. The relationship between the input and output highlights the importance of data consistency, especially when dealing with qualitative information that may originally be presented in various formats. This standardization facilitates easier comparison, analysis, and understanding of the geographical distribution of higher education institutions across the United States., and input as ['University of Pennsylvania', 'Phialdelphia, PA, USA'] output is Phialdelphia, PA, USA, input as ['UCLA', 'Los Angeles, CA'] output is Los Angeles, CA, USA, input as ['Cornell University', 'Ithaca, New York, USA'] output is Ithaca, New York, USA, input as ['Penn', 'Philadelphia, PA, USA'] output is Philadelphia, PA, USA, input as ['University of Maryland College Park', 'College Park, MD'] output is College Park, MD, USA, input as ['University of Michigan', 'Ann Arbor, MI, USA'] output is Ann Arbor, MI, USA, input as ['UC Berkeley', 'Berkeley, CA'] output is Berkeley, CA, USA, input as ['MIT', 'Cambridge, MA'] output is Cambridge, MA, USA, input as ['Rice University', 'Houston, TX'] output is Houston, TX, USA, input as ['Yale University', 'New Haven, CT, USA'] output is New Haven, CT, USA, input as ['Columbia University', 'New York, NY, USA'] output is New York, NY, USA, input as ['NYU', 'New York, New York, USA'] output is New York, New York, USA, input as ['UC Berkeley', 'Berkeley, CA'] output is Berkeley, CA, USA, input as ['UIUC', 'Urbana, IL'] output is Urbana, IL, USA, input as ['Temple University', 'Philadelphia, PA'] output is Philadelphia, PA, USA, input as ['Harvard University', 'Cambridge, MA, USA'] output is Cambridge, MA, USA, input as ['University of Connecticut', 'Storrs, CT, USA'] output is Storrs, CT, USA, input as ['Drexel University', 'Philadelphia, PA'] output is Philadelphia, PA, USA, input as ['New Haven University', 'New Haven, CT, USA'] output is New Haven, CT, USA, input as ['University of California, Santa Barbara', 'Santa Barbara, CA, USA'] output is Santa Barbara, CA, USA, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
