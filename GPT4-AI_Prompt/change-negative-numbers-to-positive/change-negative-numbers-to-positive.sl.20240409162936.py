Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Input Column Summary:

The input data exhibits a variety of formats, including numeric values, percentages, and potentially negative values. The presence of special characters such as "-" and "%" at the beginning of the strings indicates a specific formatting rule applied to the data. The numeric values can be whole numbers (e.g., '500') or decimal numbers (e.g., '5.125'). The use of a leading "-%" suggests a unique format intended to represent negative percentages, although the concept of a negative percentage is not standard in all contexts. The data is qualitative in nature, as the focus is on the format and type of data rather than the numerical value itself. The variety in data presentation suggests that the input could be coming from a system that encodes information in specific ways, possibly for different types of transactions or data points.

### Output Column Summary:

The output data retains the numeric and percentage values from the input but removes any leading negative signs, indicating a transformation rule applied to the data. The output consistently preserves the original format of the numbers (e.g., whole numbers, decimal numbers) and the presence of the percentage symbol when applicable. This suggests that the transformation process is designed to normalize or correct the data by removing certain indicators (like the negative sign) while keeping the essential format and information intact. The output treats the data as qualitative, focusing on maintaining the integrity of the format and type of information rather than altering the numerical values themselves.

### Relationship Between Input and Output:

The transformation from input to output demonstrates a clear relationship focused on data normalization or correction. The primary operation involves removing any leading negative signs, which could be interpreted as correcting data entry errors or standardizing the data for further processing. The preservation of the percentage symbol and the numeric format (whole or decimal) in the output indicates that the transformation process respects the original data's qualitative aspects. This process could be particularly useful in scenarios where the presence of a negative sign is not meaningful or is considered an error, and where maintaining the type of data (numeric or percentage) is crucial for downstream analysis or reporting.

The relationship also suggests that the system or process handling this data is designed to work with a wide range of input formats, potentially coming from diverse sources or representing different types of information. The consistent treatment of the data, as seen in the transformation rules applied, points to an effort to standardize or clean the data for uniformity, making it easier to handle, analyze, or display in subsequent stages of the data processing pipeline., and input as ['-%134'] output is %134, input as ['500'] output is 500, input as ['5.125'] output is 5.125, input as ['-%43.00'] output is %43.00, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
