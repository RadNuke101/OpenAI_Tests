Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Input Column Summary:

The input data appears to be a mix of numeric and symbolic characters, with a focus on representing numbers in various formats. The data can include:

1. **Plain Numbers:** Represented in both integer (e.g., '500') and decimal formats (e.g., '5.125'), indicating a straightforward numeric value without any additional symbols except for the decimal point in some cases.

2. **Percentage Indicators:** Some inputs are prefixed with a percentage symbol ('%') and a negative sign ('-'), such as '-%134' and '-%43.00'. This suggests a specific format where the input is meant to denote a negative percentage value, although the exact interpretation in the context of the data is not entirely clear from the examples provided.

3. **Formatting Variations:** The inputs show variations in formatting, such as the presence or absence of decimal points, the inclusion of a negative sign, and the use of a percentage symbol. This indicates a diversity in the representation of what could be considered as numerical or quantitative data, but treated qualitatively due to these variations.

### Output Column Summary:

The output data retains the numeric and symbolic essence of the input but with specific transformations applied:

1. **Removal of Negative Signs:** Negative signs ('-') present in the input are removed in the output, suggesting a transformation rule that discards the sign of the input value.

2. **Retention of Symbols and Numbers:** The percentage symbol ('%') and numeric values (both integer and decimal) are retained in the output. This indicates that the transformation process does not alter the numeric value or the presence of specific symbols like the percentage sign.

3. **Consistency in Format:** The output maintains the original format of the numbers (integer or decimal) and the inclusion of symbols from the input, suggesting a rule-based transformation that selectively removes or ignores certain characters (like the negative sign) while keeping others.

### Relationship Summary:

The transformation from input to output demonstrates a qualitative treatment of the data, focusing on format and symbolic representation rather than the quantitative value of the numbers. The key relationship observed is the systematic removal of negative signs from the input to produce the output, while retaining all other aspects of the input's format and symbolic representation. This process suggests a rule or set of rules designed to normalize or standardize the input data by removing specific characters (e.g., the negative sign) without altering the essential qualitative characteristics of the data, such as its numeric value, decimal presence, or the inclusion of percentage symbols., and input as ['-%134'] output is %134, input as ['500'] output is 500, input as ['5.125'] output is 5.125, input as ['-%43.00'] output is %43.00, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.

    This function takes an input string that may contain numeric and symbolic characters,
