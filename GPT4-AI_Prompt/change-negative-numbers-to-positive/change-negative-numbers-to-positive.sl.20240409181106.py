Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Input Column Summary:

The input data exhibits a variety of formats, including numbers with and without decimal points, and some entries are prefixed with a special character combination "-%". The data appears to be a mix of purely numerical values and values that might represent some form of percentage change or special notation due to the "-%" prefix. The presence of decimal points in some entries indicates that the data can represent both integer and floating-point numbers. The input data is treated as qualitative, indicating that each entry is considered for its unique format and content rather than its numerical value.

### Output Column Summary:

The output data retains the numerical and decimal structure of the input data but with notable modifications to the format. Specifically, the "-%" prefix present in some input entries is replaced with a single "%" symbol in the output, and this symbol is moved to the beginning of the number. This transformation suggests a standardization process where specific input patterns (i.e., "-%") are converted into a more uniform format ("%") in the output. The output maintains the numerical integrity of the input data, including the preservation of decimal points where applicable, indicating a consistent rule of format transformation without altering the numerical value.

### Relationship Summary:

The transformation from the input to the output column data demonstrates a systematic approach to data standardization, particularly in handling special notations and formats. The process appears to focus on:

1. **Special Notation Handling:** The "-%" prefix in the input is specifically targeted for conversion. This suggests that the transformation process is designed to identify and modify certain patterns, possibly to denote a specific meaning or classification (e.g., converting a negative percentage notation into a more standardized positive percentage notation).

2. **Format Standardization:** By removing the "-" sign and correctly positioning the "%" symbol at the beginning, the process standardizes the representation of what might be interpreted as percentage values. This standardization could be important for subsequent data processing or analysis, ensuring consistency across data points.

3. **Numerical Integrity:** The transformation rules preserve the numerical value and structure (integers and decimals) of the input data in the output. This indicates that the process aims to modify the format or notation without altering the underlying numerical information.

In summary, the relationship between the input and output data highlights a focused effort on format normalization and special notation handling, ensuring that the data is consistently represented while maintaining the integrity of the numerical values. This transformation could be crucial for facilitating more straightforward analysis or interpretation of the data in subsequent processes., and input as ['-%134'] output is %134, input as ['500'] output is 500, input as ['5.125'] output is 5.125, input as ['-%43.00'] output is %43.00, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
