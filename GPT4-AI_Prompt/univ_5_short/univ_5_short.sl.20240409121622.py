Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Summary for Input Column Data:

The input data consists of two main components for each entry: the name of an educational institution (typically a university) and its associated location. The names of the institutions vary from well-known abbreviations (e.g., "UCLA" for the University of California, Los Angeles) to full names (e.g., "University of Pennsylvania"). These institutions are located across various parts of the United States, indicating a wide geographical spread. The location information provided with each institution name is not consistently formatted; it ranges from full addresses including the state abbreviation and country (e.g., "Philadelphia, PA, USA") to more abbreviated forms that might omit the country or use a full state name instead of an abbreviation (e.g., "Los Angeles, CA" or "Ithaca, New York, USA").

### Summary for Output Column Data:

The output data standardizes the location information associated with each educational institution from the input data. It ensures a consistent format across all entries, which includes the city, state abbreviation, and the country ("USA") when not originally provided. This standardization process involves correcting spelling errors (e.g., "Phialdelphia" to "Philadelphia"), abbreviating full state names to their respective two-letter codes (e.g., "New York" to "NY"), and adding missing country information for locations within the United States. The output effectively normalizes the location data, making it more uniform and easier to understand or process further.

### Relationship Between Input and Output:

The relationship between the input and output data highlights a process of standardization and correction of location information associated with various universities across the United States. The transformation from input to output focuses on achieving consistency in the presentation of location data, addressing variations in formatting, spelling errors, and missing elements. This process is crucial for applications that require uniform data formats for analysis, display, or mapping purposes. The output data serves as a refined version of the input, where the essential geographical information is preserved while enhancing readability and uniformity., and input as ['University of Pennsylvania', 'Phialdelphia, PA, USA'] output is Phialdelphia, PA, USA, input as ['UCLA', 'Los Angeles, CA'] output is Los Angeles, CA, USA, input as ['Cornell University', 'Ithaca, New York, USA'] output is Ithaca, NY, USA, input as ['Penn', 'Philadelphia, PA, USA'] output is Philadelphia, PA, USA, input as ['University of Maryland College Park', 'College Park, MD'] output is College Park, MD, USA, input as ['University of Michigan', 'Ann Arbor, MI, USA'] output is Ann Arbor, MI, USA, input as ['Columbia University', 'New York, NY, USA'] output is New York, NY, USA, input as ['NYU', 'New York, New York, USA'] output is New York, NY, USA, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
