Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Summary of Input Column Data

The input data consists of two columns, with each row representing a specific university or college and its corresponding location. The first column includes the names of various higher education institutions, which range from well-known universities such as the University of Pennsylvania, UCLA (University of California, Los Angeles), Cornell University, and Columbia University, to more colloquially referred names like "Penn" for the University of Pennsylvania and "NYU" for New York University. This diversity in naming conventions indicates a mix of formal university names and their popular abbreviations or nicknames.

The second column provides the geographical locations of these institutions, presented in a format that includes the city, state abbreviation (except for 'New York, New York' which is fully spelled out in one instance), and, in most cases, the country (USA). However, the state abbreviation is not consistent across entries, with some locations fully spelling out the state name (e.g., 'New York' instead of 'NY') and others omitting the country altogether.

### Summary of Output Column Data

The output data standardizes the format of the geographical locations associated with each institution mentioned in the input. It consistently presents the city, followed by the state abbreviation, and concludes with "USA" to denote the country. This output corrects any inconsistencies found in the input, such as fully spelled-out state names being abbreviated (e.g., 'New York' becomes 'NY') and ensures the inclusion of "USA" in every entry, even if it was missing from the original input. The output also corrects a spelling error from "Phialdelphia" to "Philadelphia."

### Relationship Between Input and Output

The transformation from input to output demonstrates a process of standardization and correction of geographical location formats associated with various universities and colleges in the United States. The output ensures a uniform presentation of location data, making it easier to read and understand at a glance. This process involves abbreviating state names, adding the country designation where it was omitted, and correcting any spelling errors. The relationship between the input and output underscores the importance of consistency in data presentation, especially when dealing with qualitative data that includes geographical information. This standardization facilitates easier comparison and reference across different entries., and input as ['University of Pennsylvania', 'Phialdelphia, PA, USA'] output is Phialdelphia, PA, USA, input as ['UCLA', 'Los Angeles, CA'] output is Los Angeles, CA, USA, input as ['Cornell University', 'Ithaca, New York, USA'] output is Ithaca, NY, USA, input as ['Penn', 'Philadelphia, PA, USA'] output is Philadelphia, PA, USA, input as ['University of Maryland College Park', 'College Park, MD'] output is College Park, MD, USA, input as ['University of Michigan', 'Ann Arbor, MI, USA'] output is Ann Arbor, MI, USA, input as ['Columbia University', 'New York, NY, USA'] output is New York, NY, USA, input as ['NYU', 'New York, New York, USA'] output is New York, NY, USA, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
