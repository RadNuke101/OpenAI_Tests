Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Summary of Input Column Data:

The input data consists of strings that represent file paths. Each string is structured to include a directory path that leads to a specific Excel file. The directory path typically starts with a drive letter (e.g., "c:"), followed by a series of folders (e.g., "/users/dave/"), and ends with the file name, which includes the file extension ".xls". The file names vary across the inputs, indicating different Excel documents such as "shotcut.xls", "formulas.xls", and "pivot table.xls". The paths suggest that all files are stored within the same user directory ("/users/dave/"), indicating a commonality in the location of these files. The input data is qualitative, focusing on the textual representation of file paths.

### Summary of Output Column Data:

The output data extracts and isolates the file name (including the extension) from the given file paths in the input data. The output is purely the names of Excel files, such as "shotcut.xls", "formulas.xls", and "pivot table.xls", without any directory paths. This data is qualitative, representing the names of files as textual information. The file names include spaces for files with multi-word names (e.g., "pivot table.xls"), and all files share the same file extension ".xls", indicating that they are Excel documents.

### Relationship Summary Between Input and Output:

The relationship between the input and output data is a process of extraction and simplification. The input data provides full file paths that locate specific Excel files within a directory structure on a computer. The output data, on the other hand, simplifies this information by extracting and presenting only the file names (and their extensions) from these paths. This process removes the directory information, focusing solely on the identity of the files themselves. The transformation from input to output effectively distills the essential information about the files (their names) from the broader context of their storage locations. This relationship highlights a filtering or reduction operation, where the specific, more detailed information (file names) is isolated from a larger set of data (full file paths)., and input as ['c=/users/dave/shotcut.xls'] output is shotcut.xls, input as ['c=/users/dave/formulas.xls'] output is formulas.xls, input as ['c=/users/dave/pivot table.xls'] output is pivot table.xls, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
