Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Summary of Input Column Data:

The input data consists of a single column containing strings that represent file paths. Each entry in this column is a path to an Excel file located within a directory structure. The paths are absolute, starting with a drive letter ('c'), followed by a series of directories ('/users/dave/'), and ending with the file name, which includes the file extension ('.xls'). The file names vary across the entries, indicating different Excel documents such as 'shotcut.xls', 'formulas.xls', and 'pivot table.xls'. The structure of the paths suggests they all belong to the same user ('dave') and are stored in the same directory. The input data is qualitative, representing textual information about the location and names of files.

### Summary of Output Column Data:

The output data consists of a single column that extracts and presents the file names (including the extension '.xls') from the input paths. The output is purely textual and qualitative, focusing on the specific Excel documents without their directory paths. The file names extracted include 'shotcut.xls', 'formulas.xls', and 'pivot table.xls', reflecting a variety of Excel files that might be used for different purposes such as shortcuts, formula sheets, or pivot tables. The output simplifies the input by removing the directory path and focusing solely on the file names.

### Relationship Between Input and Output:

The relationship between the input and output data is a transformation process where the input, a full file path, is processed to extract and output only the file name (including the file extension). This transformation discards the directory path, focusing on the identity of the file itself. The process suggests a filtering or parsing operation where the significant part of the input (the file name) is isolated from the less relevant context (the file path) for the purposes at hand. This relationship indicates a common task in data processing where specific information is extracted from a larger dataset, highlighting the importance of the file names over their locations in the filesystem for the given context., and input as ['c=/users/dave/shotcut.xls'] output is shotcut.xls, input as ['c=/users/dave/formulas.xls'] output is formulas.xls, input as ['c=/users/dave/pivot table.xls'] output is pivot table.xls, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
