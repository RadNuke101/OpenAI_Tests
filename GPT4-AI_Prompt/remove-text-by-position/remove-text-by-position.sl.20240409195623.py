Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Summary of Input Column Data:

The input data consists of a single column containing strings that represent file paths. Each entry in the column follows a similar format, starting with a drive letter (e.g., 'c='), followed by a directory path ('/users/dave/'), and ending with a file name that includes an extension ('.xls'). The directory path remains constant across all entries, indicating that all files are located in the same folder on the user's computer. The file names vary, suggesting a focus on different Excel files such as 'shotcut.xls', 'formulas.xls', and 'pivot table.xls'. The file names imply a variety of content, potentially related to different aspects of Excel usage or functionalities, like shortcuts, formulas, and pivot tables. The '.xls' extension indicates that these files are in an older Excel format, which is still widely used for spreadsheet documents.

### Summary of Output Column Data:

The output data is a simplification of the input data, focusing solely on the file names with their extensions (e.g., 'shotcut.xls', 'formulas.xls', 'pivot table.xls'). This output discards the preceding directory path and drive letter, isolating the most descriptive part of the inputâ€”the file name. The output retains the original file extension ('.xls'), which is crucial for understanding the file type. The variety in file names suggests a range of topics or functionalities within Excel that are being highlighted or worked on.

### Relationship Between Input and Output:

The relationship between the input and output data is a process of extraction and simplification. The input data provides a full path to specific Excel files located in a user's directory, while the output data distills this information to only the file name and extension. This transformation indicates a focus on identifying or listing specific Excel files by name, rather than their location on the computer. The consistent structure of the input data allows for a straightforward extraction process, where the significant variation lies in the file names, reflecting different subjects or utilities within Excel. The process effectively shifts the emphasis from where the files are stored to what the files are, highlighting the content or purpose of the Excel files rather than their location in the user's directory structure., and input as ['c=/users/dave/shotcut.xls'] output is shotcut.xls, input as ['c=/users/dave/formulas.xls'] output is formulas.xls, input as ['c=/users/dave/pivot table.xls'] output is pivot table.xls, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
