Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Summary for Input Column Data:

The input data consists of a single column containing strings that represent file paths. Each entry in this column is a path to a specific Excel file located within a directory structure. The paths are absolute, starting with a drive letter (in this case, 'c'), followed by a series of directories ('/users/dave/'), and ending with the file name, which includes the file extension '.xls'. The file names vary across the entries, indicating different Excel files such as 'shotcut.xls', 'formulas.xls', and 'pivot table.xls'. The directory path before the file name is consistent across all entries, suggesting that all files are located in the same folder on the user's computer. The data is qualitative, representing textual information about the location and names of files.

### Summary for Output Column Data:

The output data is a single column that extracts and presents only the file name (including the '.xls' extension) from each corresponding input path. This column simplifies the information from the input, focusing solely on the names of the Excel files without their directory paths. The output retains the original file names exactly as they appear in the input paths, including spaces in names such as 'pivot table.xls'. This transformation from the input to the output strips away the directory information, leaving only the essential identifier for each file. The data remains qualitative, capturing the textual names of the files.

### Relationship Between Input and Output:

The relationship between the input and output columns is a process of extraction and simplification. The input provides detailed, absolute paths to specific Excel files, containing both the directory structure and the file names. The output, on the other hand, distills this information down to just the file names, removing the directory path. This process highlights the most distinctive part of each input entry—the file name—while discarding the common directory path that does not vary across the entries. The transformation from input to output can be seen as a form of data reduction, where only the most relevant piece of information (the file name) is retained for the user's convenience. This relationship underscores a focus on identifying and isolating the unique identifiers of files within a larger, uniform directory structure., and input as ['c=/users/dave/shotcut.xls'] output is shotcut.xls, input as ['c=/users/dave/formulas.xls'] output is formulas.xls, input as ['c=/users/dave/pivot table.xls'] output is pivot table.xls, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
