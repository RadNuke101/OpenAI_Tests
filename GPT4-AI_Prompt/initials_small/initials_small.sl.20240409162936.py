Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Summary of Input Column Data:

The input data consists of full names of individuals, each entry containing a first name followed by a last name. These names are diverse, suggesting a variety of cultural or ethnic backgrounds. Each name is structured in a conventional Western format, where the first name precedes the last name, separated by a space. The names vary in length and complexity, reflecting a broad spectrum of naming conventions. The data is qualitative, representing personal identifiers without implying any hierarchical or quantitative relationship between the entries.

### Summary of Output Column Data:

The output data comprises initials derived from the corresponding full names in the input data. Each entry in the output is formatted as two capital letters separated by a period, representing the first letter of the first name and the first letter of the last name from the input. This transformation reduces the detailed personal identifiers to a minimal, standardized format. The output retains no information about the length, complexity, or cultural background suggested by the full names, focusing solely on the initial letters.

### Relationship Between Input and Output:

The relationship between the input and output data is a process of reduction and abstraction. The output is generated by extracting the first letter of each component (first and last name) of the full names provided in the input, then formatting these letters as initials. This process simplifies the diverse and complex information contained in the full names to a uniform, concise representation. The transformation from full names to initials serves to anonymize and standardize the data, making it less personally identifiable and more uniformly structured. This method of summarization is consistent across all entries, regardless of the original name's length or cultural background, highlighting a systematic approach to data abstraction., and input as ['Nancy FreeHafer'] output is N.F., input as ['Andrew Cencici'] output is A.C., input as ['Jan Kotas'] output is J.K., input as ['Mariya Sergienko'] output is M.S., , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
