Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Summary of Input Column Data

The input data consists of strings that represent phone numbers in a specific format. Each string begins with a country code prefixed with a plus sign ('+'), followed by a space, and then the phone number itself. The phone number is divided into three groups separated by hyphens ('-'). The first group appears to represent an area code or an initial segment of the phone number, which varies in length across the dataset. The second group seems to be a middle segment of the phone number, and the third group is the final segment. The length of these segments, including the country code, varies, indicating a diversity in the formatting and numbering conventions of different regions or countries. The input data, therefore, represents a structured format that combines international dialing codes with a segmented representation of phone numbers.

### Summary of Output Column Data

The output data consists of integers extracted from the input strings. Specifically, these integers are the last segment of the phone numbers provided in the input. The output values range from three to four digits, directly correlating with the final group of numbers in each input string. This suggests that the output is a specific extraction from the input, focusing solely on the last part of the phone number.

### Relationship Between Input and Output

The relationship between the input and output data is straightforward: the output is derived from the input by extracting the last segment of the phone number. This segment is always after the second hyphen in the input string, indicating a consistent pattern in how the data is structured and how the output is generated. The process of deriving the output from the input does not involve any manipulation of the numbers themselves but rather a selection of a specific portion of the input string. This relationship highlights a pattern recognition task where the goal is to identify and extract the final part of a structured string, ignoring the rest of the information, including the country code and the initial segments of the phone number., and input as ['+106 769-858-438'] output is 438, input as ['+83 973-757-831'] output is 831, input as ['+62 647-787-775'] output is 775, input as ['+172 027-507-632'] output is 632, input as ['+72 001-050-856'] output is 856, input as ['+95 310-537-401'] output is 401, input as ['+6 775-969-238'] output is 238, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
