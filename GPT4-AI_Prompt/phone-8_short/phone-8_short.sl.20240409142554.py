Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: To generate a summary for the input and output columns based on the provided data, we need to analyze the structure of the inputs and the corresponding outputs. The input data consists of phone numbers in a specific format, and the output data is a part of these phone numbers. Let's break down the input format and the relationship with the output.

### Input Column Summary:

- **Format**: The input data follows a consistent format represented as `+[Country Code] [First Segment]-[Second Segment]-[Third Segment]`. Each segment of the phone number is separated by a hyphen (-), and the country code is prefixed with a plus (+) sign.
- **Variability**: 
  - The **Country Code** varies in length, indicating that the dataset includes international numbers from countries with different code lengths.
  - The **First Segment** after the country code also varies in length and numbers, suggesting no fixed pattern for area codes or network codes within the dataset.
  - The **Second and Third Segments** are consistent in their format, each segment containing three digits separated by hyphens. This consistency might be part of a standardized phone number format within the dataset's context.

### Output Column Summary:

- The output data consistently extracts the **Third Segment** of the input phone numbers, which is always a three-digit number. This segment appears to be the focus of the output, suggesting its significance or the specific information it represents in the context of the dataset.

### Relationship Summary:

- The relationship between the input and output data is straightforward: the output consistently represents the **Third Segment** of the input phone numbers, regardless of the country code or the first two segments of the numbers.
- This relationship indicates that the third segment holds particular importance or relevance in the context of the data's use or analysis. It could represent a specific part of the phone number that is of interest, such as a unique identifier within a larger system, or perhaps it's used for categorization, verification, or other purposes that require isolating this part of the phone number.

In summary, the dataset appears to focus on extracting a specific part of international phone numbers, highlighting the third segment as a point of interest or importance. This extraction could serve various purposes, including analysis, categorization, or as part of a larger data processing task that requires this specific piece of information from each phone number., and input as ['+106 769-858-438'] output is 438, input as ['+83 973-757-831'] output is 831, input as ['+62 647-787-775'] output is 775, input as ['+172 027-507-632'] output is 632, input as ['+72 001-050-856'] output is 856, input as ['+95 310-537-401'] output is 401, input as ['+6 775-969-238'] output is 238, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
