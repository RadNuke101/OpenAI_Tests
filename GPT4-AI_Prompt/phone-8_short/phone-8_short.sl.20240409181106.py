Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: To summarize the relationship between the input and output data provided, we observe the following patterns:

### Input Data Summary:
- The input data consists of strings that represent phone numbers in a specific format.
- Each string begins with a '+' sign, followed by a country code (which varies in length), and then a space.
- After the country code, the phone number is divided into three segments separated by hyphens ('-'). These segments represent an area code, a mid-section, and an end-section of the phone number, respectively.
- The length of these segments varies across the examples, but the format '+[Country Code] [Segment1]-[Segment2]-[Segment3]' is consistent.

### Output Data Summary:
- The output data consists of integers extracted from each input string.
- Specifically, the output is always the last segment (Segment3) of the phone number from the input data, after the last hyphen.
- This segment represents the end-section of the phone number.

### Relationship Summary:
- The relationship between the input and output data is straightforward: the output is directly extracted from the input, specifically being the last segment of the phone number provided in the input.
- The process to obtain the output from the input involves identifying the last hyphen in the input string and extracting the numbers that follow it, which form the output.
- This relationship indicates a pattern of extraction where the input's structure dictates the output's value, emphasizing the importance of the input format in determining the output.

In essence, the summary highlights a consistent method of deriving the output from the input, focusing on the structural aspect of the input data to extract specific information (the last segment of the phone number) as the output., and input as ['+106 769-858-438'] output is 438, input as ['+83 973-757-831'] output is 831, input as ['+62 647-787-775'] output is 775, input as ['+172 027-507-632'] output is 632, input as ['+72 001-050-856'] output is 856, input as ['+95 310-537-401'] output is 401, input as ['+6 775-969-238'] output is 238, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
