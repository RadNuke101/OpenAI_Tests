Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Summary of Input Column Data:

The input data consists of strings that appear to follow a structured format, incorporating several distinct elements. Each entry includes a date and time stamp, followed by a dash and a phone number prefixed with a country code (+91 in the provided examples). Following the phone number, there is an equal sign and a text snippet, which seems to be a placeholder for a message or content (e.g., "loren ipsum"). The date and time are formatted as "Dec 2, 2014, 11=23 PM" or similar, with the time being separated by an equal sign instead of the conventional colon. The phone number is presented in a standard international format. The message content varies but does not seem to influence the structure or other elements of the input.

### Summary of Output Column Data:

The output data retains only a portion of the information present in the input data. Specifically, it extracts and presents the date and time information, maintaining the original format but correcting the equal sign to a colon to properly represent the time (e.g., "Dec 2, 2014, 11:23 PM"). The output omits the phone number and the message content, focusing solely on the temporal information from the input.

### Relationship Between Input and Output:

The transformation from input to output involves a selective extraction and minor formatting correction process. The relationship between the input and output data is characterized by a filtration of specific details from the input, where only the date and time are deemed relevant for the output. The correction from an equal sign to a colon in the time representation suggests an error correction or standardization step to ensure the time is properly formatted in the output. The omission of the phone number and message content indicates that these elements are not relevant for the intended use or analysis of the output data, which seems to focus exclusively on the temporal aspects of the input. This process highlights a prioritization of temporal information over other details contained within the input data., and input as ['Dec 2, 2014, 11=23 PM - +91 90000 80000= loren ipsum'] output is Dec 2, 2014, 11=23 PM, input as ['Dec 2, 2014, 11=24 PM - +91 90000 80000= loren'] output is Dec 2, 2014, 11=24 PM, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
