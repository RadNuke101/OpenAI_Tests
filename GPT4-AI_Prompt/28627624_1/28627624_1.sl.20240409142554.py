Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Input Column Summary:

The input data consists of strings that follow a specific format, combining date and time information with a phone number and a text message. Each entry is structured as follows:

1. **Date and Time**: The beginning of each string specifies a date in "Month Day, Year, Time" format, where the time is given in a 12-hour clock format followed by "AM" or "PM". An interesting aspect is the use of an equals sign "=" instead of a colon ":" to separate hours and minutes in the time portion, which is unconventional.
   
2. **Phone Number**: Following the date and time, there is a separator " - ", and then a phone number is provided. The phone number is prefixed with a country code (in this case, "+91" for India), followed by a space, and then the 10-digit phone number.

3. **Text Message**: After the phone number, there is another equals sign "=", which is followed by a text message. The content of the message varies but is represented here by placeholder text (e.g., "loren ipsum" or "loren").

### Output Column Summary:

The output data retains only the date, time, and the unconventional equals sign "=" between the hours and minutes from the input data. It discards the phone number, the text message, and the separators ("- +" and "=") that were used to demarcate these sections in the input. The output format is strictly "Month Day, Year, Time" with the time still showing the unconventional use of "=" instead of ":".

### Relationship Summary:

The transformation from input to output involves extracting and preserving specific components of the input data while discarding others. The key aspects retained in the output are:

1. **Date and Time Information**: This is kept intact, including the unconventional equals sign "=" to separate hours and minutes, which suggests that the time's formatting is a crucial detail or characteristic of interest.

2. **Removal of Phone Number and Text Message**: The process eliminates the phone number and the text message, indicating that these details are not relevant for the desired output or the analysis/application it is intended for.

3. **Preservation of Format**: Despite removing significant portions of the input data, the output maintains the original formatting of the date and time information, including the unconventional equals sign. This suggests an emphasis on consistency in how time is represented.

In summary, the transformation process focuses on isolating and preserving temporal information from a more complex string while discarding contact and textual data. This indicates that the primary interest or utility of the output lies in the temporal aspects of the input data, possibly for applications or analyses where the timing of events is more relevant than the participants or content of the communication., and input as ['Dec 2, 2014, 11=23 PM - +91 90000 80000= loren ipsum'] output is Dec 2, 2014, 11=23 PM, input as ['Dec 2, 2014, 11=24 PM - +91 90000 80000= loren'] output is Dec 2, 2014, 11=24 PM, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
