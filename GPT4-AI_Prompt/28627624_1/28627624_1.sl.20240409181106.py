Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Input Column Summary:

The input data consists of strings that follow a specific format, which includes a timestamp, a phone number, and a text message. Each string begins with a date in the format "Dec 2, 2014," followed by a time stamp that includes hours and minutes (e.g., "11=23 PM"). After the timestamp, there is a separator ("-"), followed by a phone number that starts with a country code (+91) and is followed by a 10-digit number (e.g., "90000 80000"). The phone number is then followed by an equals sign ("=") and a text message (e.g., "loren ipsum"). The text messages vary in content and length but are part of the input string.

### Output Column Summary:

The output data retains only the date and time information from the input data, formatted as "Dec 2, 2014, 11=23 PM" for each respective input. It strips away the phone number and the text message, focusing solely on the timestamp component of the input. The output format is consistent across all entries, maintaining the date, time, and the peculiar equals sign between the hour and minute, which is a carryover from the input format.

### Relationship Summary:

The relationship between the input and output data is a process of extraction and simplification. The output is derived by isolating the timestamp from the beginning of each input string and discarding the rest of the information, including the phone number and the text message. This process highlights a focus on the temporal aspect of the input data, disregarding the sender (phone number) and the content of the message (text message) for the output. The transformation from input to output demonstrates a filtering operation where only the date and time components are deemed relevant for the output, suggesting that the purpose of the output is to catalog or summarize events or messages by their occurrence time without regard to the message content or sender., and input as ['Dec 2, 2014, 11=23 PM - +91 90000 80000= loren ipsum'] output is Dec 2, 2014, 11=23 PM, input as ['Dec 2, 2014, 11=24 PM - +91 90000 80000= loren'] output is Dec 2, 2014, 11=24 PM, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
