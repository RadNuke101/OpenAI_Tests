Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Input Column Summary:

The input column contains data representing phone numbers in various formats. These formats include differences in separators (such as dashes "-", dots ".", and parentheses "<>", "[]"), and the presence or absence of spaces between segments of the numbers. Each entry is a string that represents a unique phone number, where the formatting is the primary variable. The data is qualitative in nature, as it represents different stylistic representations of phone numbers rather than numerical values to be calculated or measured. The diversity in formatting reflects common variations in how phone numbers might be presented in different contexts, such as written communication, digital forms, or visual displays.

### Output Column Summary:

The output column standardizes the format of the phone numbers provided in the input column by removing all non-numeric characters, including spaces, dashes, dots, and parentheses. The result is a uniform sequence of digits that represent the phone number without any formatting. This transformation facilitates a consistent and simplified representation of phone numbers, making them easier to process, compare, or store in databases without the need for considering various formatting differences. The output is qualitative in nature, as it represents a standardized form of the input data, maintaining the essence of the original information (the phone number) while discarding stylistic variations.

### Relationship Summary:

The relationship between the input and output columns is characterized by a process of standardization and simplification. The input data, with its qualitative variations in phone number formatting, undergoes a transformation where all non-essential characters (anything that is not a digit) are removed. This process highlights a focus on the core information—the phone number itself—by stripping away formatting elements that do not alter the phone number's identity but merely affect its presentation. The transformation from a diverse set of formats to a uniform numeric string underscores the importance of consistency and efficiency in data processing, especially in contexts where the actual numerical value of the phone number is of primary importance, such as in telecommunications, data analysis, and digital applications. This relationship demonstrates a practical approach to data normalization, where the goal is to ensure that variations in data presentation do not impede functionality or comparability., and input as ['801-456-8765'] output is 8014568765, input as ['<978> 654-0299'] output is 9786540299, input as ['978.654.0299'] output is 9786540299, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
