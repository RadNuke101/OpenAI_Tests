Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Summary of Input Column Data

The input column data consists of strings representing phone numbers in various formats. These formats include differences in separators (such as dashes "-", dots ".", and parentheses "<>", "[]"), and the presence or absence of spaces. Each string is a unique representation of a phone number, where the primary components (the area code, the middle three digits, and the last four digits) are sometimes surrounded by additional characters that do not contribute to the numeric value of the phone number itself. The diversity in formatting reflects the common variations in how phone numbers are presented in different contexts, such as written text, digital forms, or visual media. Despite these variations, each input string contains enough information to discern a standard 10-digit phone number.

### Summary of Output Column Data

The output column data consists of strings representing phone numbers in a standardized format: a continuous sequence of 10 digits without any separators or additional characters. This format simplifies the phone numbers, stripping away any formatting or decorative elements present in the input data, and leaving only the essential numeric information. The transformation from the input to the output format involves removing non-numeric characters and presenting the phone number as a simple, unambiguous sequence of digits. This standardized format is beneficial for consistency, data processing, and when a uniform representation of phone numbers is required, such as in databases, contact lists, or when used in automated dialing systems.

### Relationship Between Input and Output

The relationship between the input and output data is characterized by a process of normalization, where diverse representations of phone numbers are converted into a uniform format. This process involves identifying and extracting the numeric components of each phone number from the input data, regardless of the original formatting or the presence of non-numeric characters. The output is the distilled essence of the inputâ€”a clean, consistent, and universally recognizable format that represents the same phone numbers but in a way that is more conducive to standardization, comparison, and electronic processing.

This transformation underscores the importance of data normalization in managing and utilizing information, especially in contexts where data from varied sources must be aggregated or analyzed collectively. It also highlights the capability to interpret and process qualitative data (in this case, the varied representations of phone numbers) and convert it into a format that is more quantitative and standardized, facilitating easier manipulation, storage, and application in a wide range of practical scenarios., and input as ['801-456-8765'] output is 8014568765, input as ['<978> 654-0299'] output is 9786540299, input as ['978.654.0299'] output is 9786540299, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
