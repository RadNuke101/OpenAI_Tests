Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Summary for Input Column Data:

The input data consists of phone numbers presented in various formats. These formats include differences in separators (such as dashes "-", dots ".", and angle brackets "<>"), and the presence or absence of spaces. Each entry represents a unique phone number, and the variety in formatting suggests that the data may have been collected from multiple sources or input by different individuals with their preferences for formatting phone numbers. The consistent element across all entries is the sequence of digits that make up a phone number, which typically includes an area code followed by the local number, formatted in groups for readability. The diversity in formatting styles indicates a qualitative nature of the input data, emphasizing the importance of the visual or textual representation of the phone numbers rather than their numerical value.

### Summary for Output Column Data:

The output data standardizes the input phone numbers by removing all formatting characters, including spaces, dashes, dots, and special characters like angle brackets. The result is a uniform sequence of digits for each phone number, presented without any separators. This transformation facilitates a more streamlined and consistent representation of phone numbers, making them easier to process, compare, or store in databases. The output data focuses on the quantitative aspect of the phone numbers, treating them purely as sequences of digits devoid of any formatting nuances. This approach strips away the qualitative differences observed in the input data, aiming for uniformity and simplicity.

### Relationship Between Input and Output:

The transformation from input to output data illustrates a process of standardization and simplification. While the input data captures the qualitative aspects of phone number representation, including various formatting styles that might reflect personal preferences or regional conventions, the output data shifts the focus to a quantitative perspective, emphasizing the raw numerical value of the phone numbers. This process removes any extraneous characters, highlighting the underlying uniformity of the data despite the superficial differences in presentation. The relationship between the input and output underscores the transition from a diverse, format-rich representation to a streamlined, format-agnostic numerical sequence, facilitating easier handling and analysis of the phone numbers. This transformation is crucial for applications that require a consistent data format, such as database storage, data analysis, or automated dialing systems., and input as ['801-456-8765'] output is 8014568765, input as ['<978> 654-0299'] output is 9786540299, input as ['978.654.0299'] output is 9786540299, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
