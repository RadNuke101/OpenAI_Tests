Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Summary for Input Column Data:

The input data consists of two columns, each containing qualitative, nominal data representing first names and last names, respectively. The first column contains first names, such as "susan" and "aaron," indicating individual identifiers without any inherent numerical value or order. The second column includes last names like "chang" and "kim," which similarly serve as categorical identifiers for individuals. These names are culturally diverse, suggesting a dataset that encompasses a variety of ethnic backgrounds. The data in both columns are string types, and when combined, they represent full names of individuals. There is no indication of duplicates, missing values, or inconsistencies within the provided examples, suggesting a clean dataset focused on personal names.

### Summary for Output Column Data:

The output data is a single column that combines the first and last names from the input columns into full names, represented as a single string. For example, the first name "susan" and the last name "chang" from the input columns are concatenated to form "susan chang" in the output. This transformation maintains the integrity of the original data while presenting it in a more conventional format for representing individual names. The output is also qualitative, nominal data, with each entry uniquely identifying an individual. The format of the output suggests its utility in contexts where full names are required, enhancing readability and identification.

### Summary of the Relationship Between Input and Output:

The relationship between the input and output data is a straightforward transformation process where the first and last names from the input columns are concatenated to form full names in the output column. This process preserves the original data's qualitative, nominal nature while reformatting it for applications where full names are preferred or required. The transformation does not alter the inherent characteristics of the data but rather restructures it to enhance its utility and readability. The relationship underscores the importance of maintaining data integrity while adapting its presentation to meet specific needs or standards., and input as ['susan', 'chang'] output is susan chang, input as ['aaron', 'kim'] output is aaron kim, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.

def generated_function(first_name, last_name):
    """
    This function takes two arguments: first_name and last_name.
    It concatenates these two strings with a space in between to form a full name.
    
    Parameters:
    - first_name (str): The first name of an individual.
    - last_name (str): The last name of an individual.
    
    Returns:
    - str: The full name created by concatenating the first name and last name.

# Test cases
full_name1 = generated_function('susan', 'chang')
full_name2 = generated_function('aaron', 'kim')

# The output can be checked with print statements or used in further applications.
print(generated_function("susan", "chang"))  ## Output: susan chang
print(generated_function("aaron", "kim"))  ## Output: aaron kim
