Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Input Column Summary

The input data consists of two columns, each containing qualitative, nominal data. The first column appears to contain first names, while the second column contains last names. These names are presumably of individuals, suggesting a personal identification context. The data in both columns are textual and seem to represent a diverse set of names, indicating a variety of cultural or ethnic backgrounds. The names in each column are independent of each other in terms of data structure, but they are related in the context of identifying individuals.

### Output Column Summary

The output data is a single column that combines the information from the two input columns into a full name format, with the first name followed by the last name. This transformation suggests a process of concatenation with a space character as a delimiter between the first and last names. The output retains the qualitative, nominal nature of the input data but presents it in a more complete form that is commonly used for personal identification or addressing individuals. The output column represents a unified view of the individual's name, making it more practical for contexts where a full name is required.

### Relationship Summary

The relationship between the input and output columns is a straightforward transformation process that combines the separate elements of personal identification (first name and last name) into a single, cohesive element (full name). This process does not alter the intrinsic nature of the data but changes its format to suit different usage scenarios. The transformation is deterministic, meaning the same input will always produce the same output, ensuring consistency in the data handling. This relationship highlights a common data processing task where discrete pieces of information are merged to create a more useful or required format, often seen in data preparation stages of various applications, such as databases, user interfaces, or reporting tools., and input as ['susan', 'chang'] output is susan chang, input as ['aaron', 'kim'] output is aaron kim, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
