Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Input Column Summary:

The input data consists of strings that follow a specific format: a prefix indicating a category (e.g., "R/V", "R/S", "R/B") followed by a set of three numerical values enclosed in angle brackets "<>". These numerical values are separated by commas. The prefix appears to denote a type or category, which is consistent across entries but varies in its specific letters. The numerical values likely represent some form of data specific to each category, possibly parameters or attributes related to the prefix category.

### Output Column Summary:

The output data retains the structure of the input data but with a simplified format. The category prefix is preserved, but the angle brackets and commas are removed, resulting in a cleaner, more readable string. The numerical values are separated by spaces, making it easier to distinguish between the category prefix and the numerical data. The transformation from input to output involves formatting changes but retains the core information intact.

### Relationship Summary:

The transformation from input to output involves a standardization of format while preserving the essential information. The process can be summarized as follows:

1. **Preservation of Category Prefix:** The category prefix (e.g., "R/V", "R/S", "R/B") is kept unchanged, indicating that the category information is crucial and must be retained in the output.

2. **Removal of Enclosing Characters and Delimiters:** The angle brackets ("<", ">") and commas (",") in the input are removed in the output. This simplification suggests that while the numerical values are essential, the specific formatting of the input (i.e., the use of angle brackets and commas) is not necessary for the desired output format.

3. **Standardization of Numerical Value Separation:** In the output, the numerical values are separated by spaces instead of commas, and there are no enclosing characters. This change improves readability and possibly prepares the data for further processing or analysis where the simpler format could be beneficial.

Overall, the relationship between the input and output data involves a formatting transformation that simplifies and standardizes the data presentation without altering the core information (category prefix and numerical values). This process likely aims to make the data more accessible or to conform to a specific output standard for subsequent use., and input as ['R/V<208,0,32>'] output is R/V 208 0 32, input as ['R/S<184,28,16>'] output is R/S 184 28 16, input as ['R/B<255,88,80>'] output is R/B 255 88 80, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
