Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Input Column Summary:

The input data consists of strings that follow a specific format pattern: a prefix indicating a category (e.g., "R/V", "R/S", "R/B"), followed by a less-than symbol "<", a set of three numeric values separated by commas (representing some form of data, possibly RGB color values given their range from 0 to 255), and a greater-than symbol ">". These strings seem to encode both a categorical component (the prefix) and a set of three numerical components enclosed within angle brackets. The prefixes before the angle brackets might represent different categories or types within a broader classification system, while the numerical values could represent specific attributes or measurements related to each category.

### Output Column Summary:

The output data simplifies the format seen in the input data by removing the angle brackets and commas, resulting in a cleaner, more readable string. The output retains the initial category prefix (e.g., "R/V", "R/S", "R/B") and the three numerical values, but presents them in a space-separated format. This transformation suggests a standardization of the input data into a more uniform and possibly more accessible format, while still preserving the essential information: the category/type designation and the associated numerical values.

### Relationship Between Input and Output:

The transformation from input to output involves a formatting change that makes the data more straightforward to read and interpret without altering the underlying information. The process can be summarized as follows:

1. **Preservation of Category Information:** The category prefix (e.g., "R/V", "R/S", "R/B") is retained in the output, indicating that the categorical aspect of the data is crucial and must be preserved for identification or classification purposes.

2. **Removal of Encapsulation Symbols:** The angle brackets ("<", ">") and commas (",") used in the input to encapsulate and separate the numerical values are removed in the output. This step simplifies the format and makes the numerical data more directly accessible.

3. **Format Standardization:** The output standardizes the data into a consistent format (prefix followed by three space-separated numbers), which could facilitate easier parsing, analysis, or further processing of the data.

Overall, the relationship between the input and output data highlights a process aimed at simplifying and standardizing complex or structured data into a more user-friendly format, while ensuring that essential information is preserved and made more accessible. This transformation could be particularly useful in contexts where data readability and ease of use are priorities., and input as ['R/V<208,0,32>'] output is R/V 208 0 32, input as ['R/S<184,28,16>'] output is R/S 184 28 16, input as ['R/B<255,88,80>'] output is R/B 255 88 80, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
