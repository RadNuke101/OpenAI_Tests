Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Input Column Summary:

The input data consists of strings that represent numbers in a textual format, each separated by a "/n" delimiter. These strings are qualitative in nature, encapsulating numerical concepts in a textual form. The input varies in length, with each unique segment of text (separated by "/n") representing an increment in the numerical value that the entire string is meant to convey. The inputs range from simple representations of single numbers (e.g., 'one') to more complex strings that represent multiple numbers concatenated together with a delimiter (e.g., 'one/ntwo/nthree').

### Output Column Summary:

The output data is quantitative, consisting of integer values. Each output value directly corresponds to the count of numerical concepts represented in the input string. The output values are derived by counting the number of segments in the input string, separated by the "/n" delimiter. The range of output values in the provided examples starts from 1 and increases with the complexity of the input string, indicating a direct relationship between the length/complexity of the input and the numerical value of the output.

### Relationship Summary:

The relationship between the input and output columns is a direct mapping of the complexity of the input string to a numerical value in the output. Specifically, the output value is determined by counting the number of numerical concepts (represented as words) in the input, with each concept separated by a "/n" delimiter. This relationship is deterministic and can be summarized as follows:

- Each segment in the input string, separated by "/n", represents a unique numerical concept.
- The output value is a count of these segments, translating the qualitative representation of numbers in the input into a quantitative value in the output.
- The process transforms a qualitative description of quantity (in textual form) into a quantitative representation (as an integer).

This relationship highlights a method of quantifying qualitative data, where the textual representation of numbers is converted into actual numeric values based on the count of distinct numerical concepts present in the input data., and input as ['one'] output is 1, input as ['one/ntwo'] output is 2, input as ['one/ntwo/nthree'] output is 3, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
