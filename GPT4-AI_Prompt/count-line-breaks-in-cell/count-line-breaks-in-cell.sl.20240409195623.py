Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Input Column Summary:

The input data consists of strings that represent numbers in a textual format, each separated by a unique delimiter `/n`. The strings are essentially lists of numbers spelled out in English, ranging from "one" to potentially higher numbers, although the examples provided only go up to "three". Each string within the input column can contain one or more of these textual numbers, with the count of numbers within a string varying. The delimiter `/n` is used to separate different numbers within the same string. The input data is qualitative, representing a textual enumeration of numbers rather than numerical values.

### Output Column Summary:

The output data is numerical, representing the count of textual numbers present in each input string. The output is a single integer for each input string, summarizing the quantity of textual numbers identified within that string. The range of the output in the provided examples is from 1 to 3, directly correlating to the number of textual numbers present in the input string. The output data is quantitative, providing a straightforward numerical summary of the complexity or length of each input string in terms of the count of numbers it contains.

### Relationship Summary:

The relationship between the input and output data is a direct mapping of the count of textual numbers within each input string to a numerical value in the output. The output serves as a summary statistic for the input, quantifying how many distinct textual numbers are present. This relationship is deterministic, where the output can be precisely predicted given the input string by counting the occurrences of the delimiter `/n` plus one (as the first number won't be preceded by a delimiter). The process of transforming the input to the output involves parsing the input string, identifying and counting the textual numbers separated by the delimiter, and then representing this count as a numerical output. This transformation highlights a method of converting qualitative data (textual descriptions of numbers) into quantitative data (a numerical count of those descriptions)., and input as ['one'] output is 1, input as ['one/ntwo'] output is 2, input as ['one/ntwo/nthree'] output is 3, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
