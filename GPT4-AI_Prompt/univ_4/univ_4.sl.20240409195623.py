Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Summary of Input Column Data

The input data consists of two columns, each containing specific information about various universities in the United States. The first column lists the names of the universities, which include a mix of full university names (e.g., "University of Pennsylvania") and abbreviations or informal names (e.g., "UCLA" for University of California, Los Angeles). This variety indicates a recognition of institutions by both their formal titles and their commonly used names or acronyms.

The second column provides the location of these universities, including the city and state. In some instances, the country ("USA") is also included, while in others, it is omitted. This suggests an assumption of a primarily American context for the data, with the explicit mention of "USA" serving to clarify or emphasize the location's country when deemed necessary. The state names are sometimes fully spelled out (e.g., "New York") and other times abbreviated (e.g., "NY"), indicating a lack of consistency in the format used for locations.

### Summary of Output Column Data

The output data standardizes the format of the university locations provided in the second input column. It consistently includes the city, state abbreviation, and the country ("USA"), regardless of how the original input was formatted. This standardization process involves correcting spelling errors (e.g., "Phialdelphia" to "Philadelphia"), abbreviating state names when they were originally spelled out, and adding "USA" to all entries to ensure uniformity and clarity regarding the country. The output thus represents a cleaned and standardized version of the university locations, making the data more concise and easier to understand at a glance.

### Relationship Between Input and Output

The transformation from input to output demonstrates a process of data standardization and cleaning. The relationship between the input and output columns is one of refinement, where the original location information provided with each university is streamlined into a consistent format. This process involves correcting typographical errors, standardizing state names to their abbreviations, and ensuring the country is explicitly mentioned for all entries. The goal of this transformation is to enhance the clarity, uniformity, and usability of the location data associated with each university, making it more accessible and easier to interpret for any subsequent analysis or presentation., and input as ['University of Pennsylvania', 'Phialdelphia, PA, USA'] output is Phialdelphia, PA, USA, input as ['UCLA', 'Los Angeles, CA'] output is Los Angeles, CA, USA, input as ['Cornell University', 'Ithaca, New York, USA'] output is Ithaca, NY, USA, input as ['Penn', 'Philadelphia, PA, USA'] output is Philadelphia, PA, USA, input as ['University of Maryland College Park', 'College Park, MD'] output is College Park, MD, USA, input as ['University of Michigan', 'Ann Arbor, MI, USA'] output is Ann Arbor, MI, USA, input as ['Columbia University', 'New York, NY, USA'] output is New York, NY, USA, input as ['NYU', 'New York, New York, USA'] output is New York, NY, USA, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
