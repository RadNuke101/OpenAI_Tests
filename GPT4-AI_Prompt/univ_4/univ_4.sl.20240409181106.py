Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Summary for Input Column Data:

The input data consists of two primary columns, with each row representing a specific university or college and its associated location. The first column includes the full names of universities or abbreviations, such as "University of Pennsylvania," "UCLA," and "Cornell University," as well as more informal names like "Penn" and "NYU." This variety indicates a mix of formal institutional names and commonly used abbreviations or nicknames.

The second column provides the geographical locations of these institutions. These locations are presented with varying levels of detail, from city and state combinations like "Los Angeles, CA" to more complete addresses that include the country, as seen in "Philadelphia, PA, USA." Some entries use the full state name, such as "New York," while others use the state abbreviation, like "NY." This inconsistency in detail level suggests a flexible approach to specifying locations, accommodating both abbreviated and full forms.

### Summary for Output Column Data:

The output data standardizes the format of the geographical locations associated with each university or college mentioned in the input data. Each output entry is structured as "City, State Abbreviation, USA," ensuring a consistent presentation of location information across all entries. This standardization process includes correcting spelling errors (e.g., "Phialdelphia" to "Philadelphia"), abbreviating state names to their two-letter codes (e.g., "New York" to "NY"), and appending ", USA" to entries lacking the country designation. The output effectively homogenizes the location data, making it uniformly accessible and easier to interpret at a glance.

### Relationship Between Input and Output:

The transformation from input to output data demonstrates a process of standardization and correction. The primary goal is to achieve a uniform format for representing the locations of various universities and colleges, facilitating easier comparison and reference. This process involves correcting typographical errors, standardizing state names to their abbreviations, and ensuring the presence of the country designation ("USA") in every entry. The relationship between the input and output underscores the importance of consistency in data presentation, especially when dealing with geographical information that may originally be provided in various formats. This standardization aids in clarity and usability of the data for any further analysis or reference purposes., and input as ['University of Pennsylvania', 'Phialdelphia, PA, USA'] output is Phialdelphia, PA, USA, input as ['UCLA', 'Los Angeles, CA'] output is Los Angeles, CA, USA, input as ['Cornell University', 'Ithaca, New York, USA'] output is Ithaca, NY, USA, input as ['Penn', 'Philadelphia, PA, USA'] output is Philadelphia, PA, USA, input as ['University of Maryland College Park', 'College Park, MD'] output is College Park, MD, USA, input as ['University of Michigan', 'Ann Arbor, MI, USA'] output is Ann Arbor, MI, USA, input as ['Columbia University', 'New York, NY, USA'] output is New York, NY, USA, input as ['NYU', 'New York, New York, USA'] output is New York, NY, USA, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
