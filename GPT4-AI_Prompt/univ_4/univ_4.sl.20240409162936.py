Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Summary of Input Column Data:

The input data consists of two columns, with each row representing a specific university or college and its corresponding location. The first column includes the names of various prestigious universities and colleges, some referred to by their full names (e.g., "University of Pennsylvania," "Cornell University") and others by their commonly used abbreviations or nicknames (e.g., "UCLA" for University of California, Los Angeles, "Penn" for the University of Pennsylvania). This variety indicates a mix of formal and informal naming conventions used to identify institutions of higher education.

The second column provides the geographical locations of these institutions, including the city and state within the United States. Some entries also include the country ("USA"), while others omit it, suggesting an assumption that the context is primarily within the United States. The state names are sometimes fully spelled out (e.g., "New York") and other times abbreviated (e.g., "NY"), indicating a lack of consistency in the representation of geographical information.

### Summary of Output Column Data:

The output data standardizes the format of the geographical locations associated with each university or college mentioned in the input. It consistently presents the city, state abbreviation, and the country ("USA") for each institution, regardless of how the location was originally provided in the input. This standardization simplifies the geographical information, making it more uniform and easier to understand at a glance. The output corrects any misspellings (e.g., "Phialdelphia" to "Philadelphia") and ensures state names are consistently abbreviated, enhancing the clarity and accuracy of the location data.

### Relationship Between Input and Output:

The relationship between the input and output data demonstrates a process of standardization and correction of geographical information associated with various universities and colleges. The output takes the diverse formats and representations of locations from the input—ranging from fully spelled-out state names to missing country identifiers—and converts them into a uniform format that includes the city, state abbreviation, and the country "USA" for each institution. This process not only corrects any inaccuracies (such as misspellings) but also fills in missing information (such as adding "USA" where it was omitted) to ensure a consistent and clear presentation of location data for each educational institution listed., and input as ['University of Pennsylvania', 'Phialdelphia, PA, USA'] output is Phialdelphia, PA, USA, input as ['UCLA', 'Los Angeles, CA'] output is Los Angeles, CA, USA, input as ['Cornell University', 'Ithaca, New York, USA'] output is Ithaca, NY, USA, input as ['Penn', 'Philadelphia, PA, USA'] output is Philadelphia, PA, USA, input as ['University of Maryland College Park', 'College Park, MD'] output is College Park, MD, USA, input as ['University of Michigan', 'Ann Arbor, MI, USA'] output is Ann Arbor, MI, USA, input as ['Columbia University', 'New York, NY, USA'] output is New York, NY, USA, input as ['NYU', 'New York, New York, USA'] output is New York, NY, USA, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
