Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Summary for Input Column Data:

The input data comprises two main elements for each entry: the name of an educational institution and its corresponding location. These institutions range from universities with full names (e.g., "University of Pennsylvania") to abbreviations or informal names (e.g., "UCLA" for University of California, Los Angeles, and "Penn" for the University of Pennsylvania). The locations provided alongside these institutions vary in their level of detail, from city and state (e.g., "Los Angeles, CA") to more comprehensive formats that include the country (e.g., "Philadelphia, PA, USA"). The geographical scope of the input data is confined to the United States, covering a variety of states such as Pennsylvania, California, New York, Maryland, and Michigan. The cities mentioned are home to these prestigious institutions, indicating a diverse representation of American higher education across different states.

### Summary for Output Column Data:

The output data standardizes the format of the location information provided in the input. It ensures consistency in the presentation of city, state abbreviation, and country ("USA"), even when the original input may have omitted certain details (e.g., converting "Los Angeles, CA" to "Los Angeles, CA, USA" and standardizing "New York, New York, USA" to "New York, NY, USA"). This process of standardization includes correcting misspellings (e.g., "Phialdelphia" to "Philadelphia") and ensuring state abbreviations are used consistently (e.g., "New York" to "NY"). The output uniformly appends ", USA" to all entries, assuming all locations are within the United States, thereby making the geographical context explicit even when it was implied or absent in the input.

### Relationship Between Input and Output:

The transformation from input to output demonstrates a process of standardization and correction of location data associated with various educational institutions. The relationship between the input and output columns highlights an effort to present location information in a uniform, concise, and accurate format. This process involves correcting typographical errors, standardizing state abbreviations, and ensuring the inclusion of the country ("USA") for clarity and completeness. The output serves to make the data more accessible and understandable, particularly for audiences that may require a consistent format for location information, such as in databases, directories, or analytical reports. This standardization facilitates easier comparison, sorting, and integration of the data into broader datasets or systems that require uniformity in geographical information presentation., and input as ['University of Pennsylvania', 'Phialdelphia, PA, USA'] output is Phialdelphia, PA, USA, input as ['UCLA', 'Los Angeles, CA'] output is Los Angeles, CA, USA, input as ['Cornell University', 'Ithaca, New York, USA'] output is Ithaca, NY, USA, input as ['Penn', 'Philadelphia, PA, USA'] output is Philadelphia, PA, USA, input as ['University of Maryland College Park', 'College Park, MD'] output is College Park, MD, USA, input as ['University of Michigan', 'Ann Arbor, MI, USA'] output is Ann Arbor, MI, USA, input as ['Columbia University', 'New York, NY, USA'] output is New York, NY, USA, input as ['NYU', 'New York, New York, USA'] output is New York, NY, USA, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
