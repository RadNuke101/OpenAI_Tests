Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Input Column Summary:

The input data consists of two columns. The first column contains names in a "LastName,FirstName" format, representing individuals' names with their last names followed by a comma and then their first names. This format suggests a structured approach to capturing names, emphasizing the distinction between last and first names by separating them with a comma. The names appear to be of a personal nature, likely representing individuals rather than entities or organizations.

The second column contains numerical values '1' or '2', which are qualitative indicators rather than quantitative data. These numbers do not represent counts, measures, or quantities but are instead categorical labels or codes that signify different aspects or categories to be extracted from the first column. The presence of only two categories ('1' and '2') suggests a binary classification or selection process applied to the data in the first column.

### Output Column Summary:

The output data is a single column that contains either the first name or the last name of the individuals from the first input column. The determination of whether the output is a first name or a last name is governed by the numerical value in the second input column. Specifically, when the second column's value is '1', the output is the individual's first name. Conversely, when the value is '2', the output is the individual's last name. This output column reflects a selective extraction of information based on the categorical indicator provided in the second input column.

### Relationship Between Input and Output:

The relationship between the input and output columns is defined by a rule-based extraction process, where the second input column acts as a key to select specific parts of the data presented in the first input column. The numerical value in the second column ('1' or '2') directly determines which part of the name (first or last) is extracted and presented in the output column. This process illustrates a conditional selection mechanism where:

- A value of '1' in the second input column signifies that the first name (the part of the string following the comma) should be extracted and presented as the output.
- A value of '2' in the second input column signifies that the last name (the part of the string before the comma) should be extracted and presented as the output.

This structured relationship highlights a clear, rule-based linkage between the input data and the resulting output, showcasing a straightforward method for categorically parsing and extracting specific elements from a composite data point based on a given criterion., and input as ['Chang,Amy', '1'] output is Amy, input as ['Chang,Amy', '2'] output is Chang, input as ['smith,bobby', '2'] output is smith, input as ['smith,bobby', '1'] output is bobby, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
