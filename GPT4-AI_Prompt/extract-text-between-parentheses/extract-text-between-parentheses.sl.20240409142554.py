Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Summary for Input Column Data

The input data consists of strings formatted in a specific pattern where each entry includes a name followed by a space and a number enclosed in angle brackets. The name part of the string appears to be consistent across the examples provided, specifically "Jones", suggesting that the input data may pertain to a single entity or category identified by this name. The number within the angle brackets varies across the entries, indicating a variable attribute or measurement associated with the name. The format of the input data suggests a structured way of representing information where the qualitative component (the name "Jones") is constant, and the quantitative component (the number within angle brackets) changes. This pattern implies a relationship where each entry associates a specific value with the entity "Jones", potentially representing measurements, scores, or some other form of quantitative assessment.

### Summary for Output Column Data

The output data consists of numerical values extracted from the input data. Each output value corresponds directly to the number enclosed in angle brackets in the input data, with the output being the numerical representation of that value. The output data is purely quantitative, stripped of the qualitative context (the name "Jones" and the angle brackets) present in the input data. This transformation from the input to the output suggests a process of extracting specific numerical information from a structured textual representation.

### Relationship Summary Between Input and Output

The relationship between the input and output data is characterized by a process of extraction and simplification, where a specific piece of quantitative information (the number within angle brackets) is isolated from a more complex string that also contains qualitative information (the name "Jones"). This process effectively separates the numerical value from its textual context, converting a mixed-format entry into a purely numerical output. The consistent format of the input data suggests that this extraction process can be systematically applied to each entry, indicating a clear, predictable relationship between the input and output. The transformation highlights the importance of the numerical value within each input entry, suggesting that the primary interest or focus of this data processing task is on these quantitative measurements associated with the name "Jones"., and input as ['Jones <60>'] output is 60, input as ['Jones <57>'] output is 57, input as ['Jones <55>'] output is 55, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
