Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Summary of Input Column Data

The input data consists of strings formatted in a specific way, where each entry contains a name followed by a space and a number enclosed in angle brackets. The name appears to be consistent across the examples provided, "Jones," suggesting that the data might pertain to a single entity or a category labeled with this name. The numbers within the angle brackets vary across the entries, indicating some form of measurement or value associated with "Jones." The format is consistent, suggesting a structured data collection method where the key identifier (in this case, "Jones") is followed by a quantifiable attribute or value of interest enclosed in angle brackets.

### Summary of Output Column Data

The output data extracts and presents the numerical values enclosed within the angle brackets from the input data. These values are presented as integers, stripped of any additional context or formatting present in the input. The output directly correlates to the specific attribute or measurement associated with "Jones" in the input, providing a clear, numerical representation of that attribute without any additional textual information.

### Relationship Between Input and Output

The relationship between the input and output data is a direct extraction and transformation process, where the output is derived by isolating and converting the numerical value enclosed in angle brackets from the input string into an integer. This process effectively distills the input data, removing textual context to focus solely on the quantitative aspect of the data represented by the numbers. The consistent format of the input data facilitates this extraction, indicating a structured approach to data representation where the qualitative descriptor ("Jones") is paired with a quantitative measurement or value, and the output focuses exclusively on this quantitative element. This relationship highlights a methodical data processing technique aimed at simplifying and extracting specific numerical values from a more complex data structure for further analysis or use., and input as ['Jones <60>'] output is 60, input as ['Jones <57>'] output is 57, input as ['Jones <55>'] output is 55, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
