Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Summary for Input Column Data:

The input data consists of strings that follow a specific format: a name (in this case, "Jones") followed by a space and a number enclosed in angle brackets. The name remains constant across all examples, while the number within the angle brackets varies. This format suggests a structured way of representing information where the name could represent a category, identifier, or label, and the number within the brackets represents a value associated with that label. The input data is qualitative in nature, as it represents a specific format of textual information rather than purely numerical data. However, the number within the brackets can be extracted and treated as quantitative data for further analysis or operations.

### Summary for Output Column:

The output data consists of numerical values that have been extracted from the input strings. Specifically, these numbers represent the values enclosed within the angle brackets in the input data. The output is purely quantitative, providing a clear, numeric representation of a part of the input data. This transformation from a structured string format to a numeric format allows for easier analysis and manipulation of the data values, facilitating operations such as comparison, aggregation, or statistical analysis.

### Relationship Between Input and Output:

The relationship between the input and output data is a process of extraction and transformation. The input data, which combines both textual and numerical information in a specific format, is processed to isolate and extract the numerical portion of the data. This process involves identifying the pattern in the input data (the number enclosed in angle brackets), extracting this portion, and converting it into a numeric format for the output. The transformation from qualitative to quantitative data enables a more straightforward analysis of the values associated with the label ("Jones" in this case) in the input data. This relationship highlights a common data processing task where specific pieces of information are extracted from a structured text format for further quantitative analysis., and input as ['Jones <60>'] output is 60, input as ['Jones <57>'] output is 57, input as ['Jones <55>'] output is 55, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
