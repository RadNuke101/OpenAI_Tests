Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Summary for Input Column Data:

The input data consists of two primary columns, each representing distinct but related pieces of information about various prestigious universities in the United States. The first column lists the names of the universities, which include a range of well-known institutions such as the University of Pennsylvania, Cornell University, University of Maryland College Park, University of Michigan, Yale University, and Columbia University. These names indicate a focus on higher education institutions that are recognized for their academic excellence and historical significance.

The second column provides specific geographical details associated with each university, including the city, state, and in most cases, the country (USA) where the university is located. Locations vary from urban settings like New York, NY, and Philadelphia, PA, to more suburban or college town environments such as Ithaca, New York, and Ann Arbor, MI. This geographical information not only situates each university within a physical context but also hints at the diverse settings in which top-tier American higher education institutions are found.

### Summary for Output Column Data:

The output data combines the information from the two input columns into a single, cohesive format: "University Name, City, State, Country." This format standardizes the presentation of each university's name alongside its geographical location, creating a clear and concise reference for each institution. The output effectively merges the distinct pieces of information (university name and location) from the input columns, providing a comprehensive identifier for each university that includes both its academic and geographical context.

### Relationship Summary:

The relationship between the input and output data is a transformation process that integrates two separate pieces of information (university name and geographical location) into a unified format. This process enhances the clarity and utility of the data by creating a standardized reference for each university that is both informative and easy to understand. The transformation from separate input columns to a combined output column demonstrates an effective method of data consolidation, making it easier for users to grasp the essential details (name and location) of each university at a glance. This approach is particularly useful for applications where quick identification and geographical context of the universities are necessary, such as in academic research, educational directories, or geographic analyses of higher education institutions., and input as ['University of Pennsylvania', 'Phialdelphia, PA, USA'] output is University of Pennsylvania, Phialdelphia, PA, USA, input as ['Cornell University', 'Ithaca, New York, USA'] output is Cornell University, Ithaca, New York, USA, input as ['University of Maryland College Park', 'College Park, MD'] output is University of Maryland College Park, College Park, MD, input as ['University of Michigan', 'Ann Arbor, MI, USA'] output is University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA, input as ['Yale University', 'New Haven, CT, USA'] output is Yale University, New Haven, CT, USA, input as ['Columbia University', 'New York, NY, USA'] output is Columbia University, New York, NY, USA, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.

def generated_function(university_name, location):
    """
    This function takes two strings as input: the name of a university and its geographical location.
    It then combines these two pieces of information into a single string in the format:
    "University Name, City, State, Country."
    
    Parameters:
    university_name (str): The name of the university.
    location (str): The geographical location of the university, including city, state, and country.
    
    Returns:
    str: A string combining the university name and its location in a standardized format.
