Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Summary for Input Column Data:

The input data consists of two distinct columns, each representing specific information about various universities in the United States. The first column contains the names of prestigious universities, indicating a focus on higher education institutions renowned for their academic excellence. These universities include the University of Pennsylvania, Cornell University, University of Maryland College Park, University of Michigan, Yale University, and Columbia University, showcasing a diverse geographical representation across the United States.

The second column provides the geographical location of each university, including the city, state, and in most cases, the country (USA). This column emphasizes the physical presence and regional context of each institution, highlighting cities such as Philadelphia, Ithaca, College Park, Ann Arbor, New Haven, and New York. The inclusion of the state and, frequently, the country, underscores the national scope of these institutions within the United States.

### Summary for Output Column Data:

The output data combines the information from the two input columns into a single, cohesive format. Each entry in the output column presents the name of the university followed by its geographical location, seamlessly integrating the institution's identity with its physical setting. This format enhances the readability and accessibility of the information, making it straightforward for users to associate each university with its respective location. The output data maintains a consistent structure across all entries, facilitating a clear and immediate understanding of the relationship between each university and its geographical context.

### Relationship Summary:

The relationship between the input and output data is characterized by a transformation process that merges two distinct pieces of information into a unified format. The input data, divided into two columns, separately lists the names of universities and their locations. The output data, however, combines these two elements, presenting a comprehensive view that links each university directly with its location. This transformation enhances the utility of the information, making it more accessible and informative for users seeking to understand the geographical context of these prestigious institutions. The process underscores the importance of clear and effective data presentation, demonstrating how the organization of information can significantly impact its comprehension and use., and input as ['University of Pennsylvania', 'Phialdelphia, PA, USA'] output is University of Pennsylvania, Phialdelphia, PA, USA, input as ['Cornell University', 'Ithaca, New York, USA'] output is Cornell University, Ithaca, New York, USA, input as ['University of Maryland College Park', 'College Park, MD'] output is University of Maryland College Park, College Park, MD, input as ['University of Michigan', 'Ann Arbor, MI, USA'] output is University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA, input as ['Yale University', 'New Haven, CT, USA'] output is Yale University, New Haven, CT, USA, input as ['Columbia University', 'New York, NY, USA'] output is Columbia University, New York, NY, USA, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
