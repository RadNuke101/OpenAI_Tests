Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Summary for Input Column Data:

The input data consists of two columns, each containing specific information about various universities in the United States. The first column lists the names of prestigious universities, indicating a focus on higher education institutions renowned for their academic excellence. These institutions include the University of Pennsylvania, Cornell University, University of Maryland College Park, University of Michigan, Yale University, and Columbia University. The second column provides the geographical locations of these universities, detailing the city and state they are situated in, with some entries also including the country (USA). This column highlights the diverse geographical distribution of top-tier universities across the United States, from the Northeast in New York and Pennsylvania, to the Midwest in Michigan, and even including the capital region with Maryland.

### Summary for Output Column Data:

The output data combines the information from the two input columns into a single, cohesive format for each university. It presents a structured representation where each university's name is immediately followed by its geographical location, including city, state, and, in most cases, the country (USA). This format provides a clear and concise way to identify both the institution and its location, facilitating an easy understanding of where these prestigious universities are located. The output data serves as a streamlined reference for anyone looking to quickly grasp the basic identifying information of these institutions.

### Relationship Summary between Input and Output:

The relationship between the input and output data is a transformation from a segmented to an integrated format. Initially, the university names and their locations are presented in separate columns, requiring a reader to look across columns to gather complete information about each institution. The output data, however, merges these two pieces of information into a single, coherent statement for each university, enhancing readability and immediate comprehension. This transformation underscores the importance of presenting data in a user-friendly manner, especially when dealing with qualitative information such as names and locations. The process effectively bridges the gap between separate pieces of data, creating a more accessible and informative summary for each listed university., and input as ['University of Pennsylvania', 'Phialdelphia, PA, USA'] output is University of Pennsylvania, Phialdelphia, PA, USA, input as ['Cornell University', 'Ithaca, New York, USA'] output is Cornell University, Ithaca, New York, USA, input as ['University of Maryland College Park', 'College Park, MD'] output is University of Maryland College Park, College Park, MD, input as ['University of Michigan', 'Ann Arbor, MI, USA'] output is University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA, input as ['Yale University', 'New Haven, CT, USA'] output is Yale University, New Haven, CT, USA, input as ['Columbia University', 'New York, NY, USA'] output is Columbia University, New York, NY, USA, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
