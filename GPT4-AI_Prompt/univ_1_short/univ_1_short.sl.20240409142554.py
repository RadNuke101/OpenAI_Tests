Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Summary for Input Column Data:

The input data consists of two primary columns, each representing distinct but related pieces of information about various prestigious universities located in the United States. The first column provides the names of these universities, which include a mix of private and public institutions known for their academic excellence and historical significance. These institutions are geographically diverse, spanning from the East Coast to the Midwest. The universities mentioned are the University of Pennsylvania, Cornell University, University of Maryland College Park, University of Michigan, Yale University, and Columbia University.

The second column specifies the geographical locations of these universities, including the city, state, and in most cases, the country (USA). The locations cover a range of settings from urban environments like New York, NY, and Philadelphia, PA, to more suburban or college town settings such as Ithaca, New York, and Ann Arbor, MI. This column highlights the regional diversity of top-tier universities in the United States, indicating that prestigious institutions are not confined to a single geographic area but are spread across the country.

### Summary for Output Column Data:

The output data combines the information provided in the two input columns into a single, cohesive format. Each entry in the output column presents the name of the university followed by its geographical location, including the city, state, and, when applicable, the country (USA). This format provides a clear and concise way to identify each institution and its location, making it easier to understand the relationship between the university and its geographical context. The output data serves as a streamlined reference for anyone looking to quickly grasp where these prestigious universities are located within the United States.

### Relationship Summary:

The relationship between the input and output data is a transformation from a segmented to an integrated format. Initially, the information is divided into two separate columns, with one focusing on the names of the universities and the other on their geographical locations. The output then merges these two pieces of information into a single, comprehensive statement for each university. This transformation enhances the readability and utility of the data by providing all relevant details in a unified format. It reflects a common practice in data processing where related pieces of information are combined to improve clarity and accessibility for the end-user., and input as ['University of Pennsylvania', 'Phialdelphia, PA, USA'] output is University of Pennsylvania, Phialdelphia, PA, USA, input as ['Cornell University', 'Ithaca, New York, USA'] output is Cornell University, Ithaca, New York, USA, input as ['University of Maryland College Park', 'College Park, MD'] output is University of Maryland College Park, College Park, MD, input as ['University of Michigan', 'Ann Arbor, MI, USA'] output is University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA, input as ['Yale University', 'New Haven, CT, USA'] output is Yale University, New Haven, CT, USA, input as ['Columbia University', 'New York, NY, USA'] output is Columbia University, New York, NY, USA, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
