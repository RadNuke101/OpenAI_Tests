Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Input Column Summary:

The input data consists of names, each entry comprising two parts that are likely to represent a first name and a last name, although the order in which they appear can vary. The names are of East Asian origin, specifically suggesting Korean names based on the surnames provided (e.g., "Park," "Lee," "Kim"). Each entry in the input column is structured as a single string within an array, indicating that each row contains a single data point representing a full name. The variability in the order of the names within each entry suggests that the dataset does not follow a strict format for how names are presented.

### Output Column Summary:

The output data consistently presents what appears to be the last name of each input name, regardless of its position in the input. This indicates that the process or algorithm used to generate the output is designed to identify and extract the surname from a given full name. The output is uniform in its structure, providing a single name without an array or additional formatting, focusing solely on what is identified as the surname from the input data.

### Relationship Summary:

The relationship between the input and output data is characterized by the extraction of a specific component of the input data - the surname. This process does not depend on the position of the surname within the input (whether it appears first or last), suggesting an understanding or rule set that identifies common Korean surnames and extracts them. The transformation from input to output demonstrates a filtering or reduction operation where only the part of the input data deemed relevant (the surname) is retained in the output. This indicates that the system or algorithm is designed with a specific focus on surnames, possibly for applications where the surname is of primary interest or relevance, such as sorting, categorization, or identification purposes within a context where the uniqueness or importance of the surname is recognized., and input as ['Park Kim'] output is Kim, input as ['Lee Kim'] output is Kim, input as ['Kim Lee'] output is Lee, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
