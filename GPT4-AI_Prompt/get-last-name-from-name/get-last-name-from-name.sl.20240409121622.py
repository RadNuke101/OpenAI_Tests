Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Input Column Summary:

The input data consists of names, each entry formatted as a pair of names separated by a space. These names appear to be of East Asian origin, commonly found in cultures where family names precede given names, such as in Korean and Chinese naming conventions. Each entry combines two distinct names, which could either represent a combination of a family name and a given name or two given names. The dataset does not specify the cultural or naming convention context explicitly, leaving the interpretation of which part of the name is the family name and which is the given name to be inferred from the output.

### Output Column Summary:

The output data consistently presents a single name for each input entry, suggesting a selection process that extracts one of the two names from the input. Given the examples provided, the output appears to favor the second name listed in the input for the first two examples ('Park Kim' → 'Kim', 'Lee Kim' → 'Kim') and the first name in the third example ('Kim Lee' → 'Lee'). This indicates that the selection process does not strictly follow a position-based rule (i.e., always choosing the first or second name) but rather might be influenced by other factors not explicitly detailed in the data provided.

### Relationship Summary:

The relationship between the input and output data suggests a selective extraction process based on a criterion or set of criteria not entirely discernible from the examples given. The process does not adhere strictly to positional selection (i.e., always choosing the first or last name in the input) but seems to extract a name based on other factors, which could include cultural naming conventions, the recognition of common family names versus given names, or possibly the context within which the names are used. Without additional context or rules governing the selection process, it's challenging to ascertain a definitive pattern or rule that explains the output consistently. However, it's clear that the output is derived by selecting one of the names from the input, indicating a filtering or decision-making process based on characteristics of the names themselves or their arrangement., and input as ['Park Kim'] output is Kim, input as ['Lee Kim'] output is Kim, input as ['Kim Lee'] output is Lee, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
