Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Summary of Input Data

The input data consists of two columns, with each row containing a pair of values. The first column contains the string 'Hannah', which remains constant across all rows. The second column contains a single character, which varies across rows and includes both lowercase and uppercase letters ('n', 'x', 'N', 'a', 'h').

1. **First Column (Name):** The name 'Hannah' is a fixed value for all entries, indicating that the analysis or operation to be performed is specific to this name. This column does not vary and thus does not contribute to the variability in the output.

2. **Second Column (Character):** This column contains a mix of lowercase and uppercase characters, including 'n', 'x', 'N', 'a', and 'h'. This variability in characters is crucial as it directly influences the output based on the presence and frequency of these characters in the first column's string ('Hannah').

### Summary of Output Data

The output data is a single column that represents the count of occurrences of the character specified in the second input column within the string specified in the first input column. The output values observed are 2, 0, and 1, corresponding to different characters.

1. **Character Count:** The output values range from 0 to 2, indicating the number of times a character from the second input column appears in the 'Hannah' string. The count is case-sensitive, as demonstrated by the difference in output for 'n' and 'N'.

### Relationship Between Input and Output

The relationship between the input columns and the output column is a function of character occurrence within a specified string. The output is determined by counting how many times the character specified in the second input column appears in the string 'Hannah', which is specified in the first input column. This relationship highlights a few key points:

1. **Case Sensitivity:** The operation is case-sensitive, as shown by the difference in counts for 'n' and 'N', where 'n' appears twice in 'Hannah', resulting in an output of 2, while 'N' does not appear at all, resulting in an output of 0.

2. **Character Specificity:** The count is specific to the character in question, with some characters ('n', 'a') appearing more than once, some appearing once ('h'), and others not appearing at all ('x', 'N') in 'Hannah'.

3. **Consistency Across Inputs:** The first column being constant means the variability in output is solely due to the second column's character and its presence in the 'Hannah' string.

This summary elucidates the direct relationship between the character specified in the input and its frequency in the 'Hannah' string, with the operation being sensitive to character case and specificity., and input as ['Hannah', 'n'] output is 2, input as ['Hannah', 'x'] output is 0, input as ['Hannah', 'N'] output is 0, input as ['Hannah', 'a'] output is 2, input as ['Hannah', 'h'] output is 1, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
