Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Input Column Summary:

The input data consists of two columns, with each row representing a pair of a string and a character. The first column contains strings, all instances of the name "Hannah" in this dataset. The second column consists of single characters, which include 'n', 'x', 'N', 'a', and 'h'. These characters are being searched for within the strings of the first column. The characters vary in being either part of the string "Hannah" or not, and in their case sensitivity.

### Output Column Summary:

The output data is a single column that represents the count of occurrences of the specified character (from the second input column) within the string (from the first input column). The output values observed in the dataset are 2, 0, and 1. These values correspond to the number of times the specified character appears in the string "Hannah".

### Relationship Summary:

The relationship between the input and output columns can be summarized as follows:

1. **Case Sensitivity:** The search for characters within the string "Hannah" is case-sensitive. This is evident from the input ['Hannah', 'n'] producing an output of 2, while ['Hannah', 'N'] results in an output of 0. Despite 'n' and 'N' being the same letter, their case difference leads to different counts.

2. **Character Presence:** The output is directly related to whether the specified character is present in the string "Hannah" and how many times it appears. For characters that are part of the string "Hannah" ('n', 'a', 'h'), the output is a positive integer reflecting their count. For characters not present in the string ('x', 'N'), the output is 0.

3. **Specificity to "Hannah":** The dataset specifically examines the occurrences of characters within the string "Hannah". This means the analysis is highly specific and not generalized to other strings or contexts.

4. **Quantitative Output for Qualitative Input:** The relationship translates a qualitative input (character presence and case) into a quantitative output (count). This demonstrates how qualitative attributes can be quantified under specific conditions.

In summary, the dataset illustrates how the occurrence count of a character within a specific string is influenced by the character's presence, its frequency within the string, and case sensitivity. This relationship between the input columns and the output column showcases a straightforward, case-sensitive search operation within a fixed string., and input as ['Hannah', 'n'] output is 2, input as ['Hannah', 'x'] output is 0, input as ['Hannah', 'N'] output is 0, input as ['Hannah', 'a'] output is 2, input as ['Hannah', 'h'] output is 1, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
