Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Input Column Summary:

The input column consists of full names of individuals, which are presented in a variety of formats. These names are composed of first names, middle initials or names, and last names. The structure of the names varies, including differences in cultural naming conventions (e.g., Western-style names like "Susan Ann Chang" and Eastern-style names like "Ayako Tanaka"). Some entries may also include middle initials (e.g., "Bobby T. Smth"), indicating a diversity in the format and composition of the names provided. The input data is qualitative, representing personal identifiers that are unique to each individual.

### Output Column Summary:

The output column extracts and presents the first name from each full name provided in the input column. This process simplifies the complex and varied input data into a more uniform set of data, focusing solely on the first names of the individuals. The output is qualitative, capturing the essential component of personal identity as represented by the first name, disregarding middle names, initials, and last names.

### Relationship Summary:

The relationship between the input and output columns is characterized by a transformation process that extracts the first name from a full name. This process involves analyzing the input data, identifying the first name component of each full name, and then isolating and presenting this component as the output. The transformation demonstrates a focus on simplification and the extraction of a specific, consistent piece of information (the first name) from a more complex and varied dataset (the full names). This relationship highlights the ability to distill essential information from a detailed and diverse set of qualitative data, providing a uniform output that retains a key aspect of personal identity., and input as ['Susan Ann Chang'] output is Susan, input as ['Ayako Tanaka'] output is Ayako, input as ['Bobby T. smth'] output is Bobby, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
