Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Input Column Summary:

The input column consists of full names of individuals, which are structured in a variety of formats. These names appear to include first names, middle initials, and last names, with some names possibly including middle names or double-barreled surnames. The names are diverse, indicating a mix of cultural backgrounds. The structure of the names varies, with some entries including middle initials (e.g., "Bobby T. smth") and others presenting what seem to be full middle names or culturally specific naming conventions (e.g., "Susan Ann Chang", "Ayako Tanaka"). This diversity in naming conventions suggests the dataset might be inclusive of individuals from various ethnicities and cultures, reflecting a wide range of naming traditions.

### Output Column Summary:

The output column consists of what appears to be the first names extracted from the full names provided in the input column. These first names are standalone and do not include middle initials, middle names, last names, or any other identifiers that were present in the input. The output simplifies the input by isolating the first element of the given names, which suggests a process of extracting the most commonly used personal identifier from a full name - the first name. This process disregards any additional information that might be encoded in the middle or last names, focusing solely on the primary identifier individuals are most frequently addressed by.

### Relationship Between Input and Output:

The relationship between the input and output columns is characterized by a process of simplification and extraction. The input provides a detailed and culturally rich set of full names, while the output distills this information down to the first names only. This transformation indicates a systematic approach to identifying individuals by their most basic and universally recognized personal identifier, their first name. The process ignores the complexity and cultural significance of middle and last names, focusing instead on the element of the name that is most commonly used in informal and some formal contexts to address or refer to an individual. This approach suggests an underlying assumption that the first name is the most relevant piece of information for the purposes at hand, which could be anything from simplifying records for ease of reference to focusing on personal identification in contexts where the full name's complexity is unnecessary. The relationship thus highlights a prioritization of simplicity and accessibility in personal identification over the preservation of full cultural or familial identity as represented in the complete names., and input as ['Susan Ann Chang'] output is Susan, input as ['Ayako Tanaka'] output is Ayako, input as ['Bobby T. smth'] output is Bobby, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
