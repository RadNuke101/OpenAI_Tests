Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Input Column Summary:

The input column consists of full names of individuals, which are strings containing first names, middle initials or names, and last names. These names are diverse, representing various cultural backgrounds as indicated by the variety of name structures and origins, such as Western, Asian, and potentially others. The names may include middle initials or names, which are sometimes abbreviated, and the last names can be single or compound. The structure of the names suggests a formal or official naming convention, likely used in professional or formal contexts.

### Output Column Summary:

The output column contains the first names extracted from the full names provided in the input column. These first names are strings that represent the given name of each individual without including middle initials, middle names, or last names. The extraction of the first name simplifies the identity of the individual to a less formal representation, focusing on the most commonly used part of their name in casual or personal interactions.

### Relationship Between Input and Output:

The relationship between the input and output columns is a process of simplification and extraction. The output is derived by identifying and isolating the first name from the full name provided in the input. This process involves parsing the full name string, recognizing the first name component, and discarding the middle and last names. The transformation from input to output reflects a shift from a formal or complete identification of an individual to a more casual or personal identification, focusing solely on the given name. This could be useful in contexts where the familiarity or personalization of communication is preferred over formal recognition. The method assumes a consistent naming convention where the first name precedes any middle or last names, which holds true across various cultures represented in the input data, though exceptions and variations in naming conventions could pose challenges to this process., and input as ['Susan Ann Chang'] output is Susan, input as ['Ayako Tanaka'] output is Ayako, input as ['Bobby T. smth'] output is Bobby, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
