Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Input Column Summary:

The input data consists of a series of internet domain names. These domain names are qualitative in nature and represent addresses on the internet used to access various websites. Each entry in the input column is a string that typically includes a combination of subdomains (like 'www'), the main domain name (such as 'domain', 'mail', 'amazon'), and a top-level domain (TLD) or country code top-level domain (ccTLD) such as 'com', 'net', 'co.uk'. The structure of these domain names follows a common pattern where the components are separated by dots ('.'). The variety in the input data primarily comes from the different main domain names and the TLDs/ccTLDs, which indicate either the type of organization the domain is associated with ('.com' for commercial, '.net' for network) or the country the domain is registered in ('.uk' for the United Kingdom).

### Output Column Summary:

The output data extracts and isolates the top-level domain (TLD) or the country code top-level domain (ccTLD) from each internet domain name provided in the input column. The output is qualitative and consists of short strings such as 'com', 'net', 'uk', which represent the highest level of the domain name system (DNS) hierarchy directly following the last dot in a domain name. These TLDs and ccTLDs are crucial for identifying the nature or geographical association of the domain. The output data, therefore, categorizes the input domain names into broader groups based on their TLD/ccTLD, which can be indicative of the domain's intended use or its country of registration.

### Relationship Summary:

The relationship between the input and output data is a direct extraction process where the output is derived by isolating the last segment of the input domain names, specifically the top-level domain (TLD) or country code top-level domain (ccTLD). This process highlights the categorization of internet domains based on their highest hierarchical level in the domain name system (DNS). The transformation from input to output simplifies the domain names into a classification based on their TLD/ccTLD, which can be used to understand the type of entity that registered the domain (commercial, network, etc.) or the geographical location it is associated with. This relationship underscores the structured nature of domain names and how their components can be dissected to reveal specific, categorically significant information., and input as ['www.domain.com'] output is com, input as ['mail.net'] output is net, input as ['www.amaon.co.uk'] output is uk, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
