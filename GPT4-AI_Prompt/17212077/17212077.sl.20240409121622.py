Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Summary of Input Column Data

The input data consists of strings representing dates in the format "MM/DD/YYYY", where:
- "MM" stands for a two-digit month,
- "DD" stands for a two-digit day, and
- "YYYY" stands for a four-digit year.

Each entry in the input column represents a specific date, including the month, day, and year components. The data is qualitative, focusing on the representation of specific calendar dates. The input data does not inherently convey a numerical value for analysis but rather serves as categorical information specifying points in time.

### Summary of Output Column Data

The output data transforms the input dates into a simplified string format "MM/YYYY", where:
- "MM" is the two-digit month, and
- "YYYY" is the four-digit year.

This transformation results in a qualitative representation that retains the month and year of the original dates but omits the day component. The output data provides a less granular view of time, focusing on the month and year only. Like the input, the output is qualitative, categorizing dates by month and year without implying a numerical value for computation.

### Relationship Between Input and Output

The relationship between the input and output data is a process of simplification and abstraction of time representation. The transformation from the input to the output involves:
- Retaining the month ("MM") and year ("YYYY") components from the input dates,
- Omitting the day ("DD") component,
- Resulting in a more generalized representation of time that focuses on the month and year only.

This process reduces the specificity of the dates, moving from a precise day within a month and year to a broader categorization that only considers the month and year. The transformation highlights a shift from detailed to more general temporal categorization, suitable for contexts where the specific day is less relevant than the month and year. The relationship underscores a method of data simplification, where less critical information (the day) is removed to focus on more significant components (month and year) for the purpose at hand., and input as ['01/15/2013'] output is 01/2013, input as ['03/07/2011'] output is 03/2011, input as ['05/09/2009'] output is 05/2009, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
