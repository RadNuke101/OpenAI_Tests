Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Summary of Input Column Data:

The input data consists of strings representing dates in the format "MM/DD/YYYY", where:
- "MM" stands for the two-digit month,
- "DD" stands for the two-digit day, and
- "YYYY" stands for the four-digit year.

Each entry in the input column represents a specific date, including the month, day, and year components. The data is qualitative in nature, as it represents categorical information about specific dates rather than numerical values for computation. The input data is consistent in its format across all entries, allowing for a structured approach to processing and analysis.

### Summary of Output Column Data:

The output data transforms the input dates into a simplified format "MM/YYYY", where:
- "MM" represents the two-digit month, and
- "YYYY" represents the four-digit year.

This transformation results in a qualitative representation of time that focuses on the month and year components, omitting the day. The output data retains the categorical nature of the input but simplifies it by removing the day component, thus providing a more generalized view of the time period represented by each entry. The format is consistent across all output entries, facilitating a uniform understanding of the time periods without the granularity of specific days.

### Relationship Between Input and Output:

The relationship between the input and output data columns is characterized by a transformation process that simplifies the representation of time from specific dates to more generalized time periods. This process involves:
- Retaining the month ("MM") and year ("YYYY") components from the input,
- Omitting the day ("DD") component,
- Maintaining the qualitative nature of the data by focusing on the categorical representation of time rather than numerical values.

The transformation highlights a method of data abstraction where details (the day component) are removed to focus on broader time periods (months and years). This abstraction serves to simplify the data for purposes where the specific day is not critical, making the data more manageable or relevant for analyses that require a less granular time scale. The consistent format in both input and output ensures that the relationship is systematic and can be applied uniformly across different entries., and input as ['01/15/2013'] output is 01/2013, input as ['03/07/2011'] output is 03/2011, input as ['05/09/2009'] output is 05/2009, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
