Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Input Column Summary

The input data consists of a series of text strings, each containing one or more words. These strings appear to be phrases or sentences that include repetitions of a specific target word or its plural form. The target word varies across different strings but is consistent within each string. The context provided by the surrounding words in each string does not seem to alter the focus on counting occurrences of the target word or its variations. The input data is qualitative, emphasizing the linguistic composition and the occurrence of specific words within natural language constructs.

### Output Column Summary

The output data is a series of integers. Each integer corresponds to a count of occurrences of a specified target word (including its plural form) within each input string. The output is directly related to the content of the input data, serving as a quantitative measure of a specific qualitative feature (the frequency of a target word or its variations) within each input string.

### Relationship Summary

The relationship between the input and output data is characterized by a text analysis process, where the task is to identify and count occurrences of a specific target word (and its plural form) within a given string. The output integer for each input string represents the total count of the target word, reflecting both its singular and plural occurrences. This process highlights a direct mapping from a qualitative analysis of text (identifying specific words within a context) to a quantitative outcome (the count of those words).

The data suggests a focused interest in understanding how often certain words are used within given phrases or sentences, possibly for applications in text analysis, language learning, or content filtering. The transformation from qualitative input to quantitative output encapsulates a fundamental aspect of data analysis: extracting measurable insights from unstructured data., and input as ['apple apples', 'apple'] output is 2, input as ['an orange among the oranges is a spoiled orange', 'orange'] output is 3, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
