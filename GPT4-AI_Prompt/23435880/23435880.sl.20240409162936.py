Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Input Column Summary:

The input data consists of a series of text strings, each containing one or more words. These strings appear to be phrases or sentences that include a specific target word repeated one or more times. The target word is also provided separately, indicating that the focus is on identifying or quantifying the occurrence of this particular word within the given text. The examples provided include phrases with varying repetitions of the target word, suggesting that the complexity of the input can vary in terms of the target word's frequency and the overall length or structure of the text.

### Output Column Summary:

The output data is numerical, representing a count of the occurrences of the specified target word within each corresponding input text string. The numbers are integers, directly correlating to the frequency of the target word in the input data. This suggests a straightforward, quantifiable relationship between the input text and the output numbers, where the output is a direct measure of a specific characteristic (the frequency of a word) of the input.

### Relationship Summary:

The relationship between the input and output data is a direct mapping of text analysis, specifically focusing on word frequency within given text strings. The input provides a context in which a target word is embedded within a phrase or sentence, and the output quantifies how many times that target word appears in the given context. This process highlights a fundamental task in text analysis and natural language processing (NLP) - counting specific word occurrences in text data.

The purpose of this relationship is likely to demonstrate or apply basic principles of text analysis, such as word frequency analysis, which can serve as a foundation for more complex NLP tasks like sentiment analysis, topic modeling, or text classification. The simplicity of the task allows for a clear understanding of how basic data processing and analysis techniques can be applied to textual data to extract meaningful information, such as the frequency of specific words, which can be a stepping stone to more nuanced and sophisticated text analysis methods., and input as ['apple apples', 'apple'] output is 2, input as ['an orange among the oranges is a spoiled orange', 'orange'] output is 3, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
