Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Input Column Summary:

The input data consists of a series of text strings, each containing one or more words. These strings seem to focus on the occurrence of specific keywords within varied contexts. The keywords are repeated in different forms, either in singular or plural, and are sometimes surrounded by other words that do not alter the essence of the keyword's presence. The examples provided, such as 'apple apples' and 'an orange among the oranges is a spoiled orange', indicate a pattern where the focus is on counting the occurrences of a particular keyword within each string, regardless of its form or the context it appears in.

### Output Column Summary:

The output data is numerical, representing counts associated with each input string. These counts reflect the number of times a specified keyword (or its variations) appears within the corresponding input text. For instance, the output '2' for the input 'apple apples' indicates that the keyword 'apple' (regardless of being in singular or plural form) has been counted twice in the input string. Similarly, the output '3' for 'an orange among the oranges is a spoiled orange' signifies that the keyword 'orange' has been identified three times within the string.

### Relationship Summary:

The relationship between the input and output columns is a direct mapping of the occurrence frequency of specified keywords within the input texts to numerical values in the output. The process involves identifying a target keyword within each input string and counting how many times that keyword, in any of its forms (singular, plural, or within compound words), appears. This count is then represented as a numerical value in the output column. The essence of this relationship is the quantification of qualitative data, where the qualitative aspect is the presence of specific keywords within texts, and the quantitative aspect is the numerical count of these occurrences. This mapping allows for a structured analysis of the keyword frequency within textual data, providing insights into the prevalence or significance of certain words within given contexts., and input as ['apple apples', 'apple'] output is 2, input as ['an orange among the oranges is a spoiled orange', 'orange'] output is 3, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
