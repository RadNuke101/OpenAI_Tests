Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Input Column Data Summary:

The input data consists of two columns, each containing a list of names. The first column appears to contain given names (commonly referred to as first names), such as "Launa," "Lakenya," "Brendan," "Bradford," "Rudolf," and "Lara." These names vary in terms of cultural or linguistic origin, indicating a diverse set of individuals. The second column contains what are likely surnames (commonly referred to as last names), including "Withers," "Edison," "Hage," "Lango," "Akiyama," and "Constable." Like the first names, these surnames also reflect a variety of cultural backgrounds. The data in these two columns is qualitative, focusing on personal identifiers without implying any numerical or hierarchical information.

### Output Column Data Summary:

The output data is a single column that combines the names from the two input columns but in reversed order, placing the surname before the given name. For example, "Launa Withers" becomes "Withers Launa," and "Lakenya Edison" becomes "Edison Lakenya." This transformation maintains the integrity of the individual names while altering the format in which they are presented. The output data continues to be qualitative, representing a restructured version of personal identifiers without adding or subtracting information from the original input.

### Relationship Between Input and Output:

The relationship between the input and output data is characterized by a simple transformation rule: the position of the given name and surname is swapped. This process does not alter the names themselves but changes their order of presentation. The transformation suggests a focus on reorganizing the data for purposes that might require such a format, possibly for sorting, filing, or cultural preferences in name presentation. The consistent application of this rule across all data points indicates a systematic approach to reformatting personal names, maintaining the qualitative nature of the data while adjusting its structure., and input as ['Launa', 'Withers'] output is Withers Launa, input as ['Lakenya', 'Edison'] output is Edison Lakenya, input as ['Brendan', 'Hage'] output is Hage Brendan, input as ['Bradford', 'Lango'] output is Lango Bradford, input as ['Rudolf', 'Akiyama'] output is Akiyama Rudolf, input as ['Lara', 'Constable'] output is Constable Lara, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
