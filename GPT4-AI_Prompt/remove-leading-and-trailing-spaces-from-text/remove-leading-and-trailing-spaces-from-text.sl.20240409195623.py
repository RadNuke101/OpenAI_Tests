Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Input Column Summary:

The input column consists of strings that represent movie titles. These strings are characterized by irregular spacing, either at the beginning, end, or between the words of the titles. The presence of extra spaces does not follow a consistent pattern and varies from one entry to another. The titles themselves are recognizable and refer to well-known movies, but the formatting issues in the form of additional spaces make them appear unclean or improperly formatted. The input data, therefore, requires cleaning to standardize the format and improve readability.

### Output Column Summary:

The output column contains the cleaned versions of the movie titles found in the input column. In this column, the titles have been standardized by removing unnecessary spaces, whether they were leading, trailing, or extra spaces between words. The output retains the original words of the movie titles without altering their order or content, focusing solely on improving the presentation by standardizing the spacing. The result is a set of cleanly formatted movie titles that are immediately recognizable and presented in a consistent manner.

### Relationship Between Input and Output:

The transformation from the input to the output column represents a cleaning process focused on formatting, specifically the standardization of spacing within strings that denote movie titles. The relationship between the two columns is a direct mapping where each input string is processed to remove extraneous spaces, resulting in a cleaner, more presentable version of the same title in the output column. This process does not alter the essential content of the titles (i.e., the words themselves and their order) but significantly improves readability and consistency across the dataset. The transformation is purely cosmetic and does not involve any interpretation or modification of the titles beyond spacing adjustments. This cleaning step is crucial for data preprocessing, especially in contexts where textual data needs to be standardized for further analysis, display, or storage in databases where consistency is key., and input as ['  The shawshank'] output is The shawshank, input as ['The    godfather'] output is The godfather, input as ['    pulp   fiction'] output is pulp fiction, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
