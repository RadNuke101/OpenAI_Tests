Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Summary for Input Column Data:

The input data consists of strings that are titles of well-known movies. These strings are characterized by irregular spacing, either at the beginning, in the middle, or at the end of the titles. The irregularities in spacing do not follow a consistent pattern across the inputs. The titles themselves are correctly spelled and recognizable, but the formatting issues with spacing make them appear unstandardized. The input data reflects a common issue in text data processing where user input or data extraction processes result in inconsistent formatting that needs to be cleaned or standardized.

### Summary for Output Column Data:

The output data represents the cleaned and standardized versions of the movie titles provided in the input data. All leading, trailing, and excessive middle spaces have been removed to present each movie title in a consistent and readable format. The output data demonstrates the result of a text cleaning process, where the focus has been on removing unnecessary spaces while keeping the integrity and recognizability of the original movie titles intact. The output titles are now in a form that is more suitable for further processing, analysis, or display in a user interface.

### Relationship Between Input and Output:

The relationship between the input and output data is characterized by a cleaning or standardization process aimed at improving the format and readability of movie titles. The transformation from input to output involves removing unnecessary spaces without altering the actual names of the movies. This process is crucial in data preprocessing, especially in tasks involving text data, where consistent formatting is necessary for accurate analysis, comparison, or display. The transformation does not change the semantic meaning of the titles but significantly enhances their presentation and usability. This relationship highlights the importance of text cleaning as a foundational step in data preparation and analysis., and input as ['  The shawshank'] output is The shawshank, input as ['The    godfather'] output is The godfather, input as ['    pulp   fiction'] output is pulp fiction, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
