Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Summary of Input Column Data

The input column data consists of strings that represent movie titles. These titles are characterized by varying amounts of leading, trailing, and intra-word whitespace. The whitespace inconsistency within and around the movie titles suggests a lack of standardization in how the titles were inputted or collected. The titles themselves are recognizable and popular, indicating that the dataset might be focused on well-known or culturally significant movies. The presence of whitespace irregularities could be attributed to manual data entry errors, variations in data sourcing, or a deliberate inclusion for the purpose of data cleaning exercises.

### Summary of Output Column Data

The output column data presents the same movie titles found in the input column but with standardized formatting regarding whitespace. Leading and trailing whitespaces are removed, and intra-word whitespaces are normalized to a single space between words. This transformation indicates a cleaning and standardization process applied to the original titles, making them more uniform and easier to read or process for further analysis. The output data reflects a cleaned version of the input, maintaining the integrity and recognizability of the original movie titles while improving their presentation and consistency.

### Relationship Between Input and Output

The relationship between the input and output columns is defined by a data cleaning process focused on whitespace normalization. The input data, with its irregular whitespace patterns, undergoes a transformation to produce the output data, where these irregularities are corrected. This process involves trimming leading and trailing spaces and reducing any multiple intra-word spaces to a single space. The essence of the movie titles—i.e., the text itself—remains unchanged, indicating that the purpose of the transformation is to enhance readability and standardization without altering the content. This relationship highlights the importance of data preprocessing in data analysis and machine learning tasks, where clean and standardized data can significantly impact the performance of algorithms and the clarity of data presentation., and input as ['  The shawshank'] output is The shawshank, input as ['The    godfather'] output is The godfather, input as ['    pulp   fiction'] output is pulp fiction, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
