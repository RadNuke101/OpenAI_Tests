Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Input Column Summary:

The input column consists of strings that represent movie titles. These titles are characterized by irregular spacing, either at the beginning, within, or at the end of the titles. The spacing issues present in the input data suggest a need for data cleaning or preprocessing to standardize the format of the movie titles. The titles themselves are recognizable and popular, indicating that the data might be related to a collection of well-known films. The irregular spacing could be the result of data entry errors, inconsistent data collection methods, or a deliberate choice for this exercise.

### Output Column Summary:

The output column contains the cleaned versions of the movie titles found in the input column. The transformation process involves removing unnecessary spaces, whether they are leading, trailing, or extra spaces between words. The output retains the essential content of the input—namely, the movie titles—but presents it in a more standardized and readable format. This transformation makes the data more suitable for further analysis, storage, or display purposes. The output demonstrates the effectiveness of data cleaning techniques in enhancing the quality of qualitative data.

### Relationship Summary:

The relationship between the input and output columns is defined by a data cleaning process that aims to standardize the format of movie titles by removing extraneous spaces. The input data, characterized by its irregular spacing, undergoes a transformation to produce a cleaner, more uniform output. This process does not alter the fundamental content of the data (the movie titles themselves) but rather improves its presentation and usability. The transformation highlights the importance of preprocessing steps in data management and analysis, especially when dealing with qualitative data that may have been subject to inconsistent formatting or entry errors. The end goal of this relationship is to enhance the clarity and accessibility of the data, making it more useful for any subsequent operations or analyses., and input as ['  The shawshank'] output is The shawshank, input as ['The    godfather'] output is The godfather, input as ['    pulp   fiction'] output is pulp fiction, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
