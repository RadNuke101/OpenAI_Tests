Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Summary of Input Column Data:

The input data consists of strings that appear to represent advertising or campaign identifiers, each structured in a specific format that includes various abbreviations and codes. These strings are composed of multiple parts, each separated by underscores, indicating different attributes of the advertising campaigns. The components include:

1. **Campaign Identifier**: A prefix that seems to indicate the campaign type or the entity running the campaign (e.g., "Adf_ROCLeader", "MMC_ContextualLarRec", "Adf_ROC_DLBD").
2. **Ad Format and Size**: Information about the advertisement's format and size is embedded within the string (e.g., "BAN_728x90", "BAN_336x280"), suggesting the type of banner and its dimensions.
3. **Pricing Model**: A segment indicating the pricing model, such as "CPM" (Cost Per Mille, or cost per thousand impressions), followed by "STD", possibly denoting a standard rate or version.
4. **Campaign Objectives or Features**: Abbreviations that seem to denote the campaign's objectives or special features (e.g., "BRD", "LDS", "DRS"), which are not immediately clear without context but imply specific goals or targeting strategies.
5. **Targeting and Delivery Information**: The final segments provide information on targeting and delivery mechanisms (e.g., "NRT", "DCK"), which might refer to targeting criteria and the platform or network for ad delivery.

### Summary of Output Column Data:

The output data retains the structure of the input data but with key differences in the clarity and specificity of certain abbreviations. The transformation from input to output involves:

1. **Clarification of Abbreviations**: Abbreviations within the campaign objectives or features are expanded to more descriptive terms, enhancing understanding. For example, "BRD" becomes "Branding", "LDS" becomes "Leads", and "DRS" becomes "Direct Response".
2. **Consistency in Formatting**: The output data maintains the same structural integrity as the input, with each attribute of the campaign separated by underscores and retaining the order of information.
3. **Preservation of Identifiers and Formats**: Identifiers, ad formats, sizes, pricing models, and other codes remain unchanged, ensuring that the core information about each campaign is preserved.

### Relationship Between Input and Output:

The transformation from input to output data primarily involves the clarification of certain abbreviations to make the campaign objectives or features more understandable. This process does not alter the fundamental structure or the other attributes of the campaign identifiers, ensuring that the essential information about the advertisement's type, size, pricing model, and delivery mechanisms is retained. The relationship between the input and output data underscores a refinement process aimed at enhancing readability and comprehension without compromising the detailed specifications of each advertising campaign. This transformation likely serves to make the data more accessible to individuals who may not be familiar with the original abbreviations, facilitating clearer communication and analysis of campaign attributes., and input as ['Adf_ROCLeader_BAN_728x90_CPM_STD _BRD _NRT_DCK'] output is Adf_ROCLeader_BAN_728x90_CPM_STD _Branding _NRT_DCK, input as ['MMC_ContextualLarRec_BAN_336x280_CPM_STD _LDS _RTG_DCK'] output is MMC_ContextualLarRec_BAN_336x280_CPM_STD _Leads _RTG_DCK, input as ['Adf_ROC_DLBD_728x90_CPM_STD_DRS_NRT_NOR_DCK'] output is Adf_ROC_DLBD_728x90_CPM_STD_Direct Response_NRT_NOR_DCK, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
