Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Summary of Input Column Data:

The input data consists of strings that appear to represent advertising or campaign identifiers, each structured in a specific format that includes multiple components separated by underscores. These components seem to denote various attributes of the campaigns, such as:

- A prefix that likely identifies the campaign type or the entity running the campaign (e.g., "Adf_ROCLeader", "MMC_ContextualLarRec").
- A format or placement identifier (e.g., "BAN_728x90", "BAN_336x280"), which could indicate the banner size or type.
- A pricing model (e.g., "CPM_STD"), suggesting the cost per thousand impressions standard rate.
- A campaign objective or strategy (e.g., "BRD", "LDS", "DRS"), which is abbreviated and not immediately clear without context.
- Targeting or execution strategy (e.g., "NRT", "RTG"), indicating how the campaign is targeted or the type of retargeting used.
- A final component that seems to be a constant across all inputs ("DCK"), possibly denoting the platform or the environment where the campaign is run.

### Summary of Output Column Data:

The output data retains the structure of the input data but with modifications to certain components, making them more understandable or expanding abbreviations to their full form. Key transformations include:

- Expanding abbreviations related to campaign objectives or strategies into more descriptive terms (e.g., "BRD" becomes "Branding", "LDS" becomes "Leads", "DRS" becomes "Direct Response").
- Retaining other components of the input data without change, including the prefix, format/placement identifier, pricing model, and the final component ("DCK").
- The output data thus clarifies the purpose or strategy behind each campaign identifier, making it easier to understand at a glance.

### Relationship Between Input and Output:

The transformation from input to output data involves clarifying and expanding specific abbreviations within the campaign identifiers. This process retains the structural integrity and informational components of the original input while making the purpose or strategy of the campaign more explicit. The relationship between the input and output data is a direct mapping where specific abbreviated terms in the input are replaced with their full, descriptive counterparts in the output. This transformation aids in enhancing the readability and understanding of the campaign identifiers without altering the fundamental information conveyed by each string. The consistent format across both input and output suggests a systematic approach to naming and describing advertising campaigns, where the output serves as a more user-friendly version of the input data., and input as ['Adf_ROCLeader_BAN_728x90_CPM_STD _BRD _NRT_DCK'] output is Adf_ROCLeader_BAN_728x90_CPM_STD _Branding _NRT_DCK, input as ['MMC_ContextualLarRec_BAN_336x280_CPM_STD _LDS _RTG_DCK'] output is MMC_ContextualLarRec_BAN_336x280_CPM_STD _Leads _RTG_DCK, input as ['Adf_ROC_DLBD_728x90_CPM_STD_DRS_NRT_NOR_DCK'] output is Adf_ROC_DLBD_728x90_CPM_STD_Direct Response_NRT_NOR_DCK, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
