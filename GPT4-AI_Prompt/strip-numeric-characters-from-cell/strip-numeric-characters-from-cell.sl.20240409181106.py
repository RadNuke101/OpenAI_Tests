Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Summary for Input Column Data:

The input column data consists of strings that appear to be a mix of numerical values and text. These strings can be categorized into three main types based on the provided examples:

1. **Combination of Numbers and Names**: An example of this category is '34653 jim mcdonald', where the string starts with a numerical value followed by what appears to be a person's name.
2. **Price Information**: The string 'price is 500' falls into this category, indicating a statement about the price of an item or service, combining text with numerical value.
3. **Quantity Information**: The example '100 apples' represents this category, showing a numerical quantity followed by the name of an item.

The input data seems to represent a variety of information types, including personal names, pricing information, and quantities of items, all of which are prefixed by numerical values.

### Summary for Output Column Data:

The output column data retains only the text part of the input strings, excluding any leading numerical values. Based on the examples:

- From '34653 jim mcdonald', the output is 'jim mcdonald', indicating that the numerical prefix has been removed, leaving only the name.
- From 'price is 500', the output is 'price is', showing that the numerical value indicating the price has been excluded, leaving the context of the statement.
- From '100 apples', the output is 'apples', where the numerical quantity has been removed, leaving only the item's name.

The output data consistently focuses on the qualitative aspect of the input, removing any quantitative numerical values to leave behind text that provides context or names without specifying quantities or values.

### Relationship Between Input and Output:

The transformation from input to output data involves the systematic removal of numerical values from the beginning of the strings, focusing on retaining the qualitative, descriptive part of the input. This process suggests a relationship where the output is derived by filtering out quantitative data (numerical values) to highlight the qualitative data (text) within each input string. The purpose of this transformation could be to focus on the narrative or descriptive elements of the data, disregarding the numerical aspects to concentrate on names, descriptions, or contexts that are not directly tied to specific quantities or values. This relationship indicates a clear method of data simplification and abstraction, aiming to extract and emphasize the non-numerical information contained within a mixed data set., and input as ['34653 jim mcdonald'] output is  jim mcdonald, input as ['price is 500'] output is  price is , input as ['100 apples'] output is  apples, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.

# Expected outputs:
# output1 should be 'jim mcdonald'
# output2 should be 'price is'
# output3 should be 'apples'
print(generated_function("34653 jim mcdonald"))  ## Output:  jim mcdonald
