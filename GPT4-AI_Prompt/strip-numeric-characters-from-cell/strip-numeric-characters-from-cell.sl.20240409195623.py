Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Summary for Input Column Data:

The input column data appears to consist of strings that are a mix of alphanumeric characters. These strings can be categorized into three primary types based on the provided examples:

1. **Strings with Numbers and Names**: These strings start with a sequence of digits followed by personal names (e.g., '34653 jim mcdonald'). The numbers could represent identifiers, codes, or quantities, while the subsequent text represents personal names or entities.

2. **Strings with Numbers and Descriptive Text**: These strings contain numbers followed by descriptive phrases that do not include personal names (e.g., 'price is 500'). The descriptive text provides context to the numerical value, indicating a relationship or attribute, such as pricing information.

3. **Strings with Numbers and Objects**: These strings are composed of a numerical value followed by a noun or nouns that denote objects or items (e.g., '100 apples'). The numbers likely represent quantities, and the nouns specify the type of items being quantified.

### Summary for Output Column Data:

The output column data retains only the textual component from the input data, excluding any numerical values. The output can be categorized based on the nature of the retained text:

1. **Names**: When the input includes a number followed by a name, the output retains only the name (e.g., 'jim mcdonald').

2. **Descriptive Text**: For inputs that combine numbers with descriptive phrases, the output keeps the descriptive text while omitting the numerical value (e.g., 'price is').

3. **Objects**: In cases where the input consists of a number followed by objects, the output includes only the object names, removing the numerical values (e.g., 'apples').

### Relationship Between Input and Output:

The transformation from input to output involves the systematic removal of numerical values from the input strings, retaining only the textual components. This process suggests a filtering mechanism that extracts qualitative information from a mix of quantitative and qualitative data. The relationship between the input and output columns can be summarized as follows:

- The input data represents a combination of quantitative (numerical) and qualitative (textual) elements.
- The output data is derived by isolating and retaining only the qualitative elements from the input, effectively stripping away the quantitative context.
- This transformation highlights the focus on the qualitative aspects of the data, such as names, descriptions, and objects, while disregarding the quantitative information like identifiers, prices, and quantities.

The process underscores the importance of qualitative data in certain contexts, where the textual information carries more relevance than the numerical values., and input as ['34653 jim mcdonald'] output is  jim mcdonald, input as ['price is 500'] output is  price is , input as ['100 apples'] output is  apples, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
