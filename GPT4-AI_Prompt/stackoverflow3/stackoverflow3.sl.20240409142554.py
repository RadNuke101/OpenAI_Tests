Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Input Column Summary:

The input data consists of strings that follow a specific format, which includes a prefix 'geb.', a date (composed of a day, month abbreviation, and year), and in some cases, a location name. The prefix 'geb.' seems to be a constant across all entries, suggesting it might denote a specific category or type of event, possibly an abbreviation for a term in a language other than English (e.g., 'geboren' in Dutch or German, meaning 'born'). The dates vary across the entries, indicating different events or occurrences. The location, when present, follows the date and is denoted by a name, which could be a church or a specific place, as indicated by examples like 'Westerkerk HRL'. Not all entries contain a location name, suggesting that the presence of a location is optional or only applicable to certain records.

### Output Column Summary:

The output data extracts and presents only the location names from the input data, if available. In cases where the input does not include a location name, the output is left blank. This indicates that the output is specifically interested in the location aspect of the input data, disregarding other elements such as the prefix or the date. The output consistently captures the location names without any alterations, maintaining the original format and spelling as provided in the input.

### Relationship Summary:

The relationship between the input and output data is centered around the extraction of location information from a structured text format. The input data serves as a record that combines a fixed prefix, a date, and optionally, a location name. The process involves identifying and isolating the location name component from the rest of the input data. This extraction process disregards the 'geb.' prefix and the date, focusing solely on the location name, if present. The absence of a location name in the input directly results in an empty output, highlighting the selective nature of the extraction process. The output's sole focus on location names suggests that the purpose of this data transformation is to compile or analyze location-specific information, possibly for a study or database where the occurrence or event location is of primary interest., and input as ['geb. 14 oct 1956 Westerkerk HRL'] output is Westerkerk HRL, input as ['geb. 14 oct 1956 '] output is , input as ['geb. 15 feb 1987 Westerkerk HRL'] output is Westerkerk HRL, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
