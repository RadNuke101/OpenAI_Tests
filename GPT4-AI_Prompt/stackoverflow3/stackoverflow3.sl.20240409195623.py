Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Input Column Summary:

The input data consists of strings that follow a specific pattern, which includes a prefix ('geb.'), a date (composed of a day, month abbreviation, and year), and in some cases, a location name. The prefix 'geb.' is consistent across all entries, suggesting it is a fixed marker, possibly denoting an event or status, such as a birthdate given the context of dates following it. The dates provided are in a day-month-year format, with the month abbreviated to three letters and the year fully written out. The years mentioned span from at least 1956 to 1987, indicating the data might pertain to individuals or events from these years. The location, when present, follows the date and is denoted by a name, which in the provided examples is 'Westerkerk HRL'. This suggests that the location is an optional part of the data, possibly indicating the place associated with the event marked by 'geb.'. The absence of a location in some entries indicates that the location is not a mandatory element of the input data.

### Output Column Summary:

The output data extracts and presents only the location names from the input data, when available. In cases where the input data does not include a location name, the output is an empty string. This suggests that the output is specifically interested in the location aspect of the input data, disregarding the 'geb.' prefix and the date information entirely. The consistency of 'Westerkerk HRL' in the output, whenever it is present in the input, indicates a direct extraction process without alteration of the location data.

### Relationship Summary:

The relationship between the input and output data is a filtration process focused on extracting location information from a structured string. The input data, which combines a marker ('geb.'), a date, and optionally a location name, is processed to isolate and output only the location name, if present. This process ignores the 'geb.' prefix and the date entirely, indicating that the primary interest or relevance of the output is the location associated with the event or status denoted by 'geb.'. The absence of a location in the input directly results in an empty string in the output, further emphasizing that the output's sole focus is on the location data. This relationship showcases a selective extraction where only a specific part of the input data is deemed relevant for the output, aligning with a potential use case where the location is the key piece of information needed from a broader dataset., and input as ['geb. 14 oct 1956 Westerkerk HRL'] output is Westerkerk HRL, input as ['geb. 14 oct 1956 '] output is , input as ['geb. 15 feb 1987 Westerkerk HRL'] output is Westerkerk HRL, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
