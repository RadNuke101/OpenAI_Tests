Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Input Column Summary:

The input data consists of strings that are sequences of uppercase letters separated by slashes ("/"). These strings appear to represent a structured format where different segments of the string are divided by slashes. Each segment contains a sequence of letters with no apparent limit on the number of characters. The segments themselves vary in length and do not follow a specific pattern in terms of the number of letters they contain. The input data is qualitative, representing potentially categorical or hierarchical information encoded in the sequences of letters. The structure suggests that the data could be representing paths, codes, or some form of categorized information where each segment has a specific meaning or role.

### Output Column Summary:

The output data consists of strings that are sequences of uppercase letters. These outputs are extracted from the input strings, indicating a selection process based on a certain criterion. The output strings do not contain slashes, suggesting that they represent a singular segment extracted from the input. The criterion for selection is consistent across the examples, focusing on a specific segment of the input string. The output strings vary in length, reflecting the variability in the segment lengths within the input data. This output data is qualitative and appears to represent a specific category or element of interest extracted from the more complex structure of the input.

### Relationship Summary:

The relationship between the input and output data is characterized by a selection or extraction process. Specifically, the output is derived from the input by selecting a particular segment from the structured input string. The criterion for selection is based on the position of the segment within the input string's structure. In the provided examples, the output is the last segment of the input string, following the final slash. This indicates a rule-based extraction where the position of the segment within the input's hierarchical or structured format determines its selection as the output.

This relationship suggests that the input data's structure is significant and that the output's purpose is to isolate a specific piece of information from within that structure. The process effectively simplifies the complex input into a singular, focused piece of information, likely for further analysis or use in a broader context where only that specific segment is relevant. The extraction rule (selecting the last segment) implies that the position of the segment within the input has meaning, potentially indicating a hierarchy or a progression where the final segment holds particular importance or relevance., and input as ['ABCDE/FGHI/JKL/MNOPQR'] output is MNOPQR, input as ['A/ABCDE/FGHI/JKL'] output is JKL, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
