Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Input Column Summary:

The input data consists of a single string per entry, formatted as a sequence of uppercase alphabetic characters divided into segments by forward slashes (/). Each segment represents a distinct group of characters, and the number of segments within each string varies across entries. The characters within each segment are contiguous sequences from the English alphabet, and there is no repetition of segments within a single entry. The segments themselves do not follow a consistent pattern in terms of length or alphabetical sequence across different entries. The input data is qualitative, representing categorizations or groupings that do not inherently carry numerical value or order beyond the basic alphabetical order within each segment.

### Output Column Summary:

The output data for each entry is a single segment extracted from the input string. Specifically, the output is the last segment from the input string, following the last forward slash (/) in the sequence. This segment is also a sequence of uppercase alphabetic characters, maintaining the qualitative nature of the data. The output represents a specific selection from the input data, focusing on the final part of the input's structured sequence.

### Relationship Summary:

The relationship between the input and output data is a direct extraction process based on the position of segments within the input string. The output is consistently derived by identifying and selecting the last segment of the input string. This process highlights a positional relationship where the significance is placed on the final segment of the input, regardless of the total number of segments or the specific characters contained within them. The transformation from input to output does not alter the content of the selected segment but rather isolates it from the broader context of the input string. This indicates a filtering or reduction operation where the complexity or breadth of the input data is narrowed down to a specific, positionally defined element for the output., and input as ['ABCDE/FGHI/JKL/MNOPQR'] output is MNOPQR, input as ['A/ABCDE/FGHI/JKL'] output is JKL, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
