Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Input Column Summary:

The input data consists of strings that are sequences of uppercase letters separated by slashes ("/"). Each string can be viewed as a collection of segments, where each segment is a sequence of contiguous uppercase letters. The number of segments within each string varies, as does the length of each segment. The segments themselves do not follow a discernible pattern in terms of alphabetical order or length. The input data is qualitative, representing potentially categorical information, identifiers, or codes that are structured in a hierarchical or segmented manner.

### Output Column Summary:

The output data consists of strings that are also sequences of uppercase letters. Each output is a single segment extracted from the corresponding input string. The output segments vary in length and do not follow a specific alphabetical sequence, suggesting that the selection criteria for these segments are not based on the content of the segments themselves (i.e., the specific letters they contain) but rather on their position or another attribute related to the structure of the input data.

### Relationship Summary:

The relationship between the input and output data appears to be based on the selection of specific segments from within the input strings. The criteria for selecting a segment to produce the output are consistent across the examples provided, indicating a rule-based extraction rather than a random selection. Given the examples:

- For input 'ABCDE/FGHI/JKL/MNOPQR', the output is 'MNOPQR'.
- For input 'A/ABCDE/FGHI/JKL', the output is 'JKL'.

It can be inferred that the rule for extracting the output segment from the input string involves selecting the last segment after the final slash ("/"). This suggests that the position of the segment within the overall structure of the input string is the key factor determining its selection as the output. The relationship, therefore, is one where the output is systematically derived from the input based on the structural position of segments within each input string, highlighting a structured approach to extracting specific pieces of information from a larger dataset., and input as ['ABCDE/FGHI/JKL/MNOPQR'] output is MNOPQR, input as ['A/ABCDE/FGHI/JKL'] output is JKL, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
