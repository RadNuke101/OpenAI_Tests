Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Input Column Summary:

The input column consists of full names of individuals, each entry formatted as a string containing a first name followed by a last name. These names are typical personal identifiers used in various contexts, from formal documentation to casual identification. Each entry in the column represents a unique individual, with the first name and last name separated by a space. The names span a range of commonality and cultural backgrounds, indicating a diverse dataset. The input data is qualitative, focusing on the textual representation of names rather than any numerical value.

### Output Column Summary:

The output column simplifies the input names into a more concise format. Each output entry transforms the original full name from the input column into a format where only the first initial of the first name is retained, followed by the full last name. The transformation results in a string where the first initial and the last name are separated by a space. This output format reduces the verbosity of the input data while maintaining a level of uniqueness and personal identification. The output data retains its qualitative nature, focusing on the textual representation of the simplified names.

### Relationship Summary:

The transformation from the input to the output column represents a systematic reduction of the personal names from a full representation to a more compact form. This process involves retaining the first initial of the first name and keeping the last name unchanged. The relationship between the input and output data is characterized by a consistent rule of abbreviation applied across all entries, which simplifies the names for potentially easier reference or privacy reasons. This transformation could be useful in contexts where full names are unnecessary, or space is limited, and it highlights a method of maintaining identifiable uniqueness while reducing text length. The process underscores a common practice in data management where detailed information is condensed into a more manageable form without losing its essential identifying characteristics., and input as ['John Doe'] output is J Doe, input as ['Mayur Naik'] output is M Naik, input as ['Nimit Singh'] output is N Singh, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
