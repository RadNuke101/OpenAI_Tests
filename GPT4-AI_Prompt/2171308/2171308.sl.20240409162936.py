Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Summary of Input Column Data

The input column consists of full names of individuals, each entry formatted as a combination of a given name followed by a surname. These names are structured in a way that they typically represent a first name followed by a last name, without any middle names or initials included. The data appears to be personal names, likely representing a diverse set of individuals. Each name is a string that provides a clear identification of a person, with the first part being the given name and the second part being the family name or surname. The names span various cultures, indicated by the diversity in the structure and phonetics of the names provided. This qualitative data is representative of how individuals might be formally identified in a social or professional context.

### Summary of Output Column Data

The output column simplifies the input names into a more concise format, where each entry consists of the initial of the given name followed by the full surname. This transformation retains the surname in its entirety while reducing the given name to its initial, followed by a period. The output format standardizes the way names are presented, making it more compact and possibly easier to manage in contexts where space or clarity is a concern. This abbreviated format of names might be particularly useful in formal listings, documentation, or databases where consistency and brevity are valued. The output retains enough information to identify individuals uniquely but in a more streamlined form.

### Relationship Between Input and Output

The transformation from the input to the output column represents a systematic reduction of the qualitative data from a more detailed to a more summarized form. This process involves retaining the surname while abbreviating the given name to its initial, which suggests a prioritization of space-saving and perhaps an emphasis on the importance or uniqueness of surnames in identifying individuals. The relationship between the input and output data underscores a common practice in data management where detailed personal information is condensed to essential elements for ease of use, readability, or privacy reasons. This method of abbreviation could be particularly relevant in environments where quick identification is needed without the necessity of full names, such as in professional directories, academic listings, or administrative records. The consistent format across all entries in the output column also highlights a standardization effort, making the data uniformly accessible and interpretable., and input as ['John Doe'] output is J Doe, input as ['Mayur Naik'] output is M Naik, input as ['Nimit Singh'] output is N Singh, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
