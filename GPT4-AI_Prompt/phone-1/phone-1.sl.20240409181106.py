Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Based on the provided data, the input consists of strings formatted as three groups of three digits each, separated by hyphens (e.g., 'XXX-YYY-ZZZ'). The output is always the middle group of three digits from the input string. This relationship between the input and output is consistent across all examples provided. 

**Input Column Summary:**
- The input data is structured in a consistent format: a string of nine digits divided into three groups by hyphens.
- Each group contains three digits.
- The input data varies across examples, with no apparent pattern in the selection of numbers for each of the three groups.

**Output Column Summary:**
- The output data consistently extracts and presents the middle group of three digits from the input string.
- This extraction process indicates a direct relationship between the input and output, where the output is always determined by the specific position of the digits within the input string, irrespective of the actual numerical value of those digits.

**Relationship Summary:**
- The relationship between the input and output is defined by the position of the digits within the structured input format. Specifically, the output is always the second group of three digits from the input string.
- This relationship is positional and deterministic, meaning that for any input string formatted according to the described structure, the output can be directly determined without any need for further calculation or consideration of the digits' numerical values.
- The process treats the input data qualitatively, focusing on the structure and position of the digits rather than their quantitative value., and input as ['938-242-504'] output is 242, input as ['308-916-545'] output is 916, input as ['623-599-749'] output is 599, input as ['981-424-843'] output is 424, input as ['118-980-214'] output is 980, input as ['244-655-094'] output is 655, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
