Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Based on the provided data, the input consists of strings formatted as three groups of three digits each, separated by hyphens (e.g., 'XXX-YYY-ZZZ'). The output is a single group of three digits extracted from each input string. Specifically, the output is always the second group of three digits from the input string.

**Summary for Input Column Data:**
- The input data is structured in a consistent format: three groups of three digits each, separated by hyphens.
- Each group of digits ranges from 000 to 999, but no specific pattern or range limitation is observed across the provided examples.
- The input data does not show any immediate numerical relationship or pattern that determines the output directly from the numeric value of the digits.

**Summary for Output Column Data:**
- The output data consists of a single group of three digits.
- These digits are directly extracted from the input data, specifically being the second group of three digits in the input string.
- There is no transformation or calculation applied to the digits; they are taken as is from the input.

**Relationship Summary:**
- The relationship between the input and output data is positional and structural rather than numerical or based on any calculation.
- The output is always determined by extracting the second set of three digits from the input string, indicating a straightforward extraction process based on the position within the input format.
- This relationship suggests that the key to predicting the output from the input is understanding the structure of the input data rather than analyzing the numerical values of the digits themselves., and input as ['938-242-504'] output is 242, input as ['308-916-545'] output is 916, input as ['623-599-749'] output is 599, input as ['981-424-843'] output is 424, input as ['118-980-214'] output is 980, input as ['244-655-094'] output is 655, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
