Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Given the input and output data, we can observe a specific pattern that defines the relationship between the input and output columns. The input data is structured in a consistent format, where each entry is a string of numbers divided into three segments by hyphens (e.g., 'XXX-YYY-ZZZ'). The output data, on the other hand, is a single segment of numbers extracted from each input entry.

### Summary of Input Column Data:
- **Format:** Each entry in the input column follows a consistent format of 'XXX-YYY-ZZZ', where X, Y, and Z represent digits.
- **Segments:** The input data is divided into three distinct segments, separated by hyphens.
- **Variability:** The digits within each segment vary across the entries, indicating no specific pattern in terms of the numerical values within each segment.

### Summary of Output Column Data:
- **Extraction:** The output for each entry is consistently the middle segment (YYY) of the corresponding input entry.
- **Format:** The output data is a three-digit number, which does not include the hyphens present in the input data.
- **Variability:** Similar to the input data, the numerical values of the output data vary across entries, with no apparent pattern in the numbers themselves.

### Relationship Between Input and Output:
The relationship between the input and output columns is defined by the extraction of the middle segment from the input data. For every input entry, the output is specifically the second segment of numbers, indicating a direct and consistent method of deriving the output from the input. This relationship is qualitative in nature, as it focuses on the position and format of the data rather than the numerical value of the data itself. The process of deriving the output from the input does not involve any mathematical operations but rather a segmentation and selection based on the structure of the input data., and input as ['938-242-504'] output is 242, input as ['308-916-545'] output is 916, input as ['623-599-749'] output is 599, input as ['981-424-843'] output is 424, input as ['118-980-214'] output is 980, input as ['244-655-094'] output is 655, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
