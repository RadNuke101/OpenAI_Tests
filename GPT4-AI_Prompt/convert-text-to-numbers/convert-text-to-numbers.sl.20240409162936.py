Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: To generate a summary for the input column data and the output column data, and to describe the relationship between them, let's first understand the nature of the data and the transformation applied.

### Input Column Summary:
- **Nature of Data**: The input data is provided as a list of strings. Each string represents a sequence of digits (e.g., '101', '1002', '743').
- **Qualitative Aspect**: The input is treated as qualitative data, meaning each string is considered a unique identifier or category rather than a numerical value. This implies that the operations or comparisons based on numerical value are not relevant in the context of the input data.
- **Variability**: The input strings vary in length and composition, indicating a diverse set of categories or identifiers. The digits within each string do not follow a specific pattern or sequence.

### Output Column Summary:
- **Nature of Data**: The output data is a series of integers (e.g., 101, 1002, 743).
- **Transformation Applied**: Each string from the input column is converted into an integer. This process involves interpreting the sequence of digits in the string as a numerical value.
- **Consistency**: The output maintains a direct and consistent relationship with the input. Each input string is faithfully represented as an integer in the output, preserving the sequence of digits without any alteration.

### Relationship Between Input and Output:
- **Direct Mapping**: There is a direct mapping from the input to the output. Each qualitative data entry (string of digits) in the input is converted into a quantitative representation (integer) in the output. This transformation is consistent across all data points.
- **Preservation of Identity**: The identity of each input string is preserved in the output. The sequence of digits is maintained, ensuring that the unique identifier or category represented by each input string is directly recognizable in its numerical form in the output.
- **Qualitative to Quantitative Transformation**: The process effectively transforms qualitative data into quantitative data. While the input treats each string as a unique category without considering its numerical value, the output interprets and presents each string as a numerical value, enabling numerical operations and comparisons.

In summary, the relationship between the input and output columns is characterized by a straightforward and consistent transformation from qualitative identifiers (strings of digits) to their equivalent quantitative representations (integers). This transformation allows for the preservation of the unique identity of each input data point while enabling numerical interpretations and operations on the output data., and input as ['101'] output is 101, input as ['1002'] output is 1002, input as ['743'] output is 743, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
