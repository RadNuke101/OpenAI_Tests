Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Summary for Input Column Data:

The input data consists of a single column containing strings that represent numerical values. Each row in this column is a string that visually appears to be a positive integer (e.g., '101', '1002', '743'). The data is qualitative in nature, as it is represented in a textual format rather than a numerical one. However, the content of these strings suggests a quantitative aspect since they can be directly interpreted as numbers. The range of values, based on the provided examples, varies from three to four digits, indicating a potential variety in the magnitude of the numbers represented as strings. The input data does not contain any special characters, spaces, or leading zeros, suggesting a straightforward, consistent format for these string representations of numbers.

### Summary for Output Column Data:

The output data is a direct numerical translation of the input strings. Each string from the input column is converted into its corresponding integer value. For instance, the string '101' is converted into the integer 101, '1002' into 1002, and '743' into 743. This conversion process transforms the qualitative representation of numbers in the input (as strings) into a quantitative format (as integers) in the output. The output data, therefore, consists of positive integers that directly correlate with the string values provided in the input. The range and variety observed in the input are preserved in the output, maintaining the integrity of the magnitude and value of the numbers during the conversion process.

### Relationship Between Input and Output:

The relationship between the input and output data is a direct, one-to-one mapping where each string in the input column is converted into its numerical equivalent in the output column. This process transforms the data from a qualitative to a quantitative state, enabling numerical operations and analysis that were not applicable to the original string format. The conversion maintains the original value and magnitude of the numbers, ensuring that the output accurately reflects the numerical intention of the input strings. This relationship underscores a fundamental data processing task where textual representations of information are converted into a more analytically useful form, in this case, enabling the transition from qualitative to quantitative analysis., and input as ['101'] output is 101, input as ['1002'] output is 1002, input as ['743'] output is 743, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
