Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Input Column Summary:

The input data consists of a single column containing strings that represent numbers. Each entry in the column is a string that appears to be a positive integer when interpreted numerically. However, since the task treats these inputs as qualitative data, each string should be considered as a unique categorical label rather than a numerical value. The strings vary in length and composition but are made up entirely of digit characters ('0'-'9').

### Output Column Summary:

The output data is directly related to the input column but is represented in a different format. Specifically, each string from the input column is converted into an actual numerical value in the output. This transformation suggests a one-to-one mapping from the input strings to their corresponding numerical representations. The output values are positive integers, and their range and distribution directly mirror the qualitative characteristics of the input strings, albeit in a quantitative format.

### Relationship Summary:

The relationship between the input and output columns is a straightforward transformation from a qualitative representation of numbers (as strings) to their quantitative equivalents (as integers). This process involves interpreting each string from the input column as a number and converting it into an integer for the output column. The key aspect of this relationship is the preservation of the value represented by the string during the conversion process, ensuring that each unique string in the input column corresponds to a unique integer in the output column.

This transformation allows for a direct comparison and analysis of the data in numerical terms, which might not be as straightforward when the numbers are represented as strings. However, it's crucial to note that despite the initial treatment of the input data as qualitative, the inherent nature of the data (representing positive integers) and the conversion process underline a quantitative relationship between the input and output. The process does not alter the inherent value represented by each string; rather, it changes the format in which this value is presented., and input as ['101'] output is 101, input as ['1002'] output is 1002, input as ['743'] output is 743, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
