Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Input Column Summary

The input data consists of two elements: a string and a character. The string is a fixed sequence, 'zx66448', across all examples, while the character varies among 'z', 'x', '6', '4', and '8'. This character represents the target for a specific operation applied to the string. The variety in the character input suggests that the operation's effect is directly influenced by the character's presence and position within the string.

### Output Column Summary

The output data is a series of strings that result from applying a specific operation to the initial string 'zx66448', based on the character provided in the second element of the input. The operation modifies the original string by altering the occurrences or positions of the character specified. The outputs are as follows, corresponding to the input characters 'z', 'x', '6', '4', and '8', respectively: 'x66448', 'z66448', 'zx448', 'zx668', and 'zx6644'. Each output reflects the removal or reduction of the specified character in the string, indicating a direct relationship between the character specified in the input and the change observed in the output.

### Relationship Summary

The relationship between the input and output data is characterized by a modification operation applied to the initial string based on the character specified in the input. This operation appears to selectively target and remove or reduce the occurrences of the specified character in the string, leading to a modified output string. The nature of the modification—whether it involves removing all instances of the character, the first instance, or reducing the number of occurrences—is not explicitly detailed but can be inferred to be consistent across examples based on the character specified.

The operation's effect is deterministic, with the specific input character directly dictating the change in the output string. This suggests a rule-based transformation where the input character acts as a key to the type of modification applied to the initial string, resulting in a predictable and systematic alteration reflected in the output data., and input as ['zx66448', 'z'] output is x66448, input as ['zx66448', 'x'] output is z66448, input as ['zx66448', '6'] output is zx448, input as ['zx66448', '4'] output is zx668, input as ['zx66448', '8'] output is zx6644, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
