Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Summary for Input Column Data:

#### Last Name Column:
The first input column consists of last names. These are personal surnames that vary in length and alphabetic composition. The examples given include "brown", "thomas", and "ward". This column represents a diverse set of surnames without any apparent pattern in terms of length or initial letters. The surnames are typical and could belong to individuals from various cultural or ethnic backgrounds.

#### First Name Column:
The second input column contains first names. The examples provided are "traci", "linda", and "jack". Similar to the last names, these first names vary in length and alphabetic composition. They represent a mix of genders and do not follow any specific pattern regarding the starting letter or the number of syllables. These names are common and widely recognizable across different cultures.

### Summary for Output Column Data:

The output column data follows a specific pattern where the email addresses are generated by combining elements from both input columns and appending a fixed domain name. The pattern for generating email addresses is as follows:

1. The first letter of the first name (from the second input column) is taken.
2. The entire last name (from the first input column) is added next.
3. This combination is then followed by "_acme.com".

For example, given the input ['brown', 'traci'], the output is "tbrown_acme.com". This pattern is consistent across all examples, indicating a systematic approach to generating email addresses based on the given names.

### Relationship Summary:

The relationship between the input columns and the output column is a structured transformation process that generates a unique identifier (email address) for each individual. This process involves:

1. Extracting the initial from the first name.
2. Concatenating it with the full last name.
3. Appending a fixed domain name ("_acme.com") to create a standardized email format.

This method ensures that each individual's email address is somewhat unique while maintaining a consistent format across the organization or dataset. The use of both first and last names in the email address generation process helps in personalizing the email addresses, making them easier to associate with specific individuals., and input as ['brown', 'traci'] output is tbrown_acme.com, input as ['thomas', 'linda'] output is lthomas_acme.com, input as ['ward', 'jack'] output is jward_acme.com, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
