Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Summary of Input Column Data:

The input data consists of two primary columns, each containing specific information related to various universities across the United States. The first column lists the names of the universities, which include a mix of full university names (e.g., "University of Pennsylvania"), abbreviations (e.g., "UCLA" for University of California, Los Angeles), and informal names (e.g., "Penn" for the University of Pennsylvania). This variety indicates a broad representation of institutions, from Ivy League universities to public state universities and specialized institutions.

The second column provides the geographical location of each university, including the city and state. In some instances, the country ("USA") is also specified, while in others, it is omitted. The state names are sometimes abbreviated (e.g., "CA" for California), and other times they are spelled out fully (e.g., "New York"). This column underscores the diverse geographic distribution of these institutions across various states in the U.S., from the East Coast (e.g., New York, Pennsylvania) to the West Coast (e.g., California), and includes both large cities and smaller towns.

### Summary of Output Column Data:

The output data standardizes the format of the geographical locations associated with each university mentioned in the input. It consistently presents the city, state abbreviation, and the country ("USA") for each institution, regardless of how the original input was formatted. This standardization process includes correcting misspellings (e.g., "Phialdelphia" to "Philadelphia"), abbreviating state names when they were originally spelled out, and adding "USA" where it was previously omitted. The output ensures uniformity and clarity in representing the locations, making it easier to understand and compare the geographical settings of these diverse institutions.

### Relationship Summary:

The transformation from the input to the output data demonstrates a process of standardization and correction of geographical information associated with various universities in the United States. The relationship between the input and output underscores an effort to create a consistent and error-free representation of university locations, enhancing readability and comparability. This process respects the original names and locations provided but applies a uniform format and corrects inaccuracies, ensuring that the output is both accurate and uniformly presented. This standardization is crucial for any analytical or comparative tasks that might follow, as it ensures that all data points are represented in a consistent manner, facilitating easier analysis and understanding of the geographical distribution of these institutions., and input as ['University of Pennsylvania', 'Phialdelphia, PA, USA'] output is Phialdelphia, PA, USA, input as ['UCLA', 'Los Angeles, CA'] output is Los Angeles, CA, USA, input as ['Cornell University', 'Ithaca, New York, USA'] output is Ithaca, NY, USA, input as ['Penn', 'Philadelphia, PA, USA'] output is Philadelphia, PA, USA, input as ['University of Maryland College Park', 'College Park, MD'] output is College Park, MD, USA, input as ['University of Michigan', 'Ann Arbor, MI, USA'] output is Ann Arbor, MI, USA, input as ['UC Berkeley', 'Berkeley, CA'] output is Berkeley, CA, USA, input as ['MIT', 'Cambridge, MA'] output is Cambridge, MA, USA, input as ['Rice University', 'Houston, TX'] output is Houston, TX, USA, input as ['Yale University', 'New Haven, CT, USA'] output is New Haven, CT, USA, input as ['Columbia University', 'New York, NY, USA'] output is New York, NY, USA, input as ['NYU', 'New York, New York, USA'] output is New York, NY, USA, input as ['UC Berkeley', 'Berkeley, CA'] output is Berkeley, CA, USA, input as ['UIUC', 'Urbana, IL'] output is Urbana, IL, USA, input as ['Temple University', 'Philadelphia, PA'] output is Philadelphia, PA, USA, input as ['Harvard University', 'Cambridge, MA, USA'] output is Cambridge, MA, USA, input as ['University of Connecticut', 'Storrs, CT, USA'] output is Storrs, CT, USA, input as ['Drexel University', 'Philadelphia, PA'] output is Philadelphia, PA, USA, input as ['New Haven University', 'New Haven, CT, USA'] output is New Haven, CT, USA, input as ['University of California, Santa Barbara', 'Santa Barbara, CA, USA'] output is Santa Barbara, CA, USA, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
