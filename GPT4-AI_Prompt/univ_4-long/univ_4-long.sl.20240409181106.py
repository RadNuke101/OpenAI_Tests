Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Summary for Input Column Data:

The input data consists of two primary columns, each containing information related to various universities and colleges across the United States. The first column specifies the name of the institution, which includes a mix of full university names (e.g., "University of Pennsylvania"), abbreviations (e.g., "UCLA" for University of California, Los Angeles), and informal names (e.g., "Penn" for the University of Pennsylvania). This variety indicates a broad representation of how institutions are colloquially and formally recognized.

The second column provides the location of each institution, including the city and state. In some instances, the country ("USA") is also included, while in others, it is omitted. This column shows a geographical diversity across the United States, covering both coasts, the Midwest, and southern regions. The cities and states mentioned range from large, well-known urban areas (e.g., "New York, NY") to smaller, college-town settings (e.g., "Urbana, IL"). The variation in the inclusion of the country designation ("USA") suggests an assumption of context or an inconsistency in how location data is presented.

### Summary for Output Column Data:

The output data standardizes the location information provided in the second input column. Each entry in the output column follows a consistent format: city, state abbreviation, and the country ("USA"), ensuring uniformity across all entries. This standardization addresses the inconsistencies found in the input data by always including the state abbreviation (even when the full state name was originally provided) and consistently appending ", USA" to each location, regardless of whether it was initially included. The output effectively normalizes the location data, making it more concise and easier to understand at a glance.

### Relationship Between Input and Output:

The transformation from input to output demonstrates a process of standardization and normalization of university location data. The relationship between the input and output columns highlights an effort to create a uniform presentation of location information across a diverse set of institutions. This process involves:

1. Condensing full state names to their respective abbreviations for consistency.
2. Correcting any misspellings in city names (e.g., "Phialdelphia" to "Philadelphia").
3. Adding the country designation ("USA") to all entries to provide a complete geographical context, assuming the target audience may benefit from the specification of the country.
4. Maintaining the city names as the primary geographical identifier, ensuring that the specific location of each institution is clear.

This summary underscores the importance of consistent data presentation, especially when dealing with qualitative information such as university names and locations. By standardizing the output, the data becomes more accessible and easier to compare across different entries, facilitating a clearer understanding of the geographical distribution of these institutions., and input as ['University of Pennsylvania', 'Phialdelphia, PA, USA'] output is Phialdelphia, PA, USA, input as ['UCLA', 'Los Angeles, CA'] output is Los Angeles, CA, USA, input as ['Cornell University', 'Ithaca, New York, USA'] output is Ithaca, NY, USA, input as ['Penn', 'Philadelphia, PA, USA'] output is Philadelphia, PA, USA, input as ['University of Maryland College Park', 'College Park, MD'] output is College Park, MD, USA, input as ['University of Michigan', 'Ann Arbor, MI, USA'] output is Ann Arbor, MI, USA, input as ['UC Berkeley', 'Berkeley, CA'] output is Berkeley, CA, USA, input as ['MIT', 'Cambridge, MA'] output is Cambridge, MA, USA, input as ['Rice University', 'Houston, TX'] output is Houston, TX, USA, input as ['Yale University', 'New Haven, CT, USA'] output is New Haven, CT, USA, input as ['Columbia University', 'New York, NY, USA'] output is New York, NY, USA, input as ['NYU', 'New York, New York, USA'] output is New York, NY, USA, input as ['UC Berkeley', 'Berkeley, CA'] output is Berkeley, CA, USA, input as ['UIUC', 'Urbana, IL'] output is Urbana, IL, USA, input as ['Temple University', 'Philadelphia, PA'] output is Philadelphia, PA, USA, input as ['Harvard University', 'Cambridge, MA, USA'] output is Cambridge, MA, USA, input as ['University of Connecticut', 'Storrs, CT, USA'] output is Storrs, CT, USA, input as ['Drexel University', 'Philadelphia, PA'] output is Philadelphia, PA, USA, input as ['New Haven University', 'New Haven, CT, USA'] output is New Haven, CT, USA, input as ['University of California, Santa Barbara', 'Santa Barbara, CA, USA'] output is Santa Barbara, CA, USA, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
