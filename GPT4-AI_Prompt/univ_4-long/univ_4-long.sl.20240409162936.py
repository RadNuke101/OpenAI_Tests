Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Summary of Input Column Data:

The input data consists of two primary columns, each containing information related to various universities and colleges across the United States. The first column specifies the name of the institution, which includes a mix of full university names (e.g., "University of Pennsylvania"), abbreviations (e.g., "UCLA" for University of California, Los Angeles), and informal names (e.g., "Penn" for the University of Pennsylvania). This variety indicates a broad representation of how institutions are referred to in both formal and colloquial contexts.

The second column provides the location of each institution, including the city and state. In some cases, the country ("USA") is also included, while in others, it is omitted. This column shows a geographical diversity of higher education institutions across different states such as California, New York, Pennsylvania, and more. The format of the location data varies, with some entries using abbreviations for states (e.g., "CA" for California) and others spelling them out fully (e.g., "New York"). Additionally, there is inconsistency in the presentation of the country, with it being included explicitly in some entries and implied in others.

### Summary of Output Column Data:

The output data standardizes the location information provided in the second input column. It consistently formats the location as "City, State Abbreviation, USA," ensuring uniformity across all entries. This standardization process includes correcting spelling errors (e.g., "Phialdelphia" to "Philadelphia"), abbreviating state names consistently, and appending ", USA" to all entries to explicitly indicate the country. The output demonstrates a systematic approach to presenting location data, making it easier to understand and compare across different institutions.

### Relationship Between Input and Output:

The transformation from input to output data highlights a process of standardization and correction of location information associated with various higher education institutions in the United States. The output retains all critical geographical identifiers from the input while ensuring that they are presented in a consistent and error-free format. This process involves correcting typographical errors, standardizing state abbreviations, and explicitly including the country when it is missing from the input. The relationship between the input and output underscores the importance of data consistency, especially when dealing with qualitative information that can vary widely in its presentation. The output makes the data more accessible and comparable, which could be particularly useful for applications requiring uniform geographical identifiers, such as mapping, statistical analysis, or compiling directories of institutions., and input as ['University of Pennsylvania', 'Phialdelphia, PA, USA'] output is Phialdelphia, PA, USA, input as ['UCLA', 'Los Angeles, CA'] output is Los Angeles, CA, USA, input as ['Cornell University', 'Ithaca, New York, USA'] output is Ithaca, NY, USA, input as ['Penn', 'Philadelphia, PA, USA'] output is Philadelphia, PA, USA, input as ['University of Maryland College Park', 'College Park, MD'] output is College Park, MD, USA, input as ['University of Michigan', 'Ann Arbor, MI, USA'] output is Ann Arbor, MI, USA, input as ['UC Berkeley', 'Berkeley, CA'] output is Berkeley, CA, USA, input as ['MIT', 'Cambridge, MA'] output is Cambridge, MA, USA, input as ['Rice University', 'Houston, TX'] output is Houston, TX, USA, input as ['Yale University', 'New Haven, CT, USA'] output is New Haven, CT, USA, input as ['Columbia University', 'New York, NY, USA'] output is New York, NY, USA, input as ['NYU', 'New York, New York, USA'] output is New York, NY, USA, input as ['UC Berkeley', 'Berkeley, CA'] output is Berkeley, CA, USA, input as ['UIUC', 'Urbana, IL'] output is Urbana, IL, USA, input as ['Temple University', 'Philadelphia, PA'] output is Philadelphia, PA, USA, input as ['Harvard University', 'Cambridge, MA, USA'] output is Cambridge, MA, USA, input as ['University of Connecticut', 'Storrs, CT, USA'] output is Storrs, CT, USA, input as ['Drexel University', 'Philadelphia, PA'] output is Philadelphia, PA, USA, input as ['New Haven University', 'New Haven, CT, USA'] output is New Haven, CT, USA, input as ['University of California, Santa Barbara', 'Santa Barbara, CA, USA'] output is Santa Barbara, CA, USA, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
