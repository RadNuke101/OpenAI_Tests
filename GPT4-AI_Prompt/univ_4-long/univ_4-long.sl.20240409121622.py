Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Summary of Input Column Data:

The input data consists of two primary elements for each entry: the name of a university and its corresponding location. These universities span across a wide range of prestigious institutions, both public and private, located within the United States. The names of the universities vary from full formal names (e.g., "University of Pennsylvania") to more colloquial abbreviations or short forms (e.g., "UCLA" for the University of California, Los Angeles). The locations provided alongside these university names are formatted with varying degrees of detail. Some entries include just the city and state abbreviation (e.g., "Los Angeles, CA"), while others provide a more comprehensive location that includes the city, state abbreviation, and the country (e.g., "Philadelphia, PA, USA"). Additionally, there are instances where the state's name is fully spelled out, and others where only the abbreviation is used. This variation in naming conventions and location detail reflects the diverse ways in which institutions and their locations can be represented in data.

### Summary of Output Column Data:

The output data standardizes the location information associated with each university. Regardless of the initial format provided in the input data, the output consistently presents the location as the city, followed by the state abbreviation, and concludes with "USA" to denote the country. This standardization process addresses inconsistencies in the input data, such as varying levels of detail and the presence or absence of the country designation. The output also corrects minor spelling errors (e.g., "Phialdelphia" to "Philadelphia") and standardizes the representation of state names to their abbreviations (e.g., "New York" to "NY"). This ensures a uniform format across all entries, making the data more cohesive and easier to interpret at a glance.

### Relationship Between Input and Output:

The transformation from input to output data illustrates a process of standardization and correction. The primary goal is to achieve a consistent format for representing the locations of various universities across the United States. This involves correcting spelling errors, standardizing state names to their abbreviations, and ensuring the inclusion of the country designation ("USA") in every entry. The relationship between the input and output data underscores the importance of data consistency, especially when dealing with qualitative information that can be represented in multiple ways. By standardizing the location information, the output data becomes more accessible and useful for analysis, comparison, and reference., and input as ['University of Pennsylvania', 'Phialdelphia, PA, USA'] output is Phialdelphia, PA, USA, input as ['UCLA', 'Los Angeles, CA'] output is Los Angeles, CA, USA, input as ['Cornell University', 'Ithaca, New York, USA'] output is Ithaca, NY, USA, input as ['Penn', 'Philadelphia, PA, USA'] output is Philadelphia, PA, USA, input as ['University of Maryland College Park', 'College Park, MD'] output is College Park, MD, USA, input as ['University of Michigan', 'Ann Arbor, MI, USA'] output is Ann Arbor, MI, USA, input as ['UC Berkeley', 'Berkeley, CA'] output is Berkeley, CA, USA, input as ['MIT', 'Cambridge, MA'] output is Cambridge, MA, USA, input as ['Rice University', 'Houston, TX'] output is Houston, TX, USA, input as ['Yale University', 'New Haven, CT, USA'] output is New Haven, CT, USA, input as ['Columbia University', 'New York, NY, USA'] output is New York, NY, USA, input as ['NYU', 'New York, New York, USA'] output is New York, NY, USA, input as ['UC Berkeley', 'Berkeley, CA'] output is Berkeley, CA, USA, input as ['UIUC', 'Urbana, IL'] output is Urbana, IL, USA, input as ['Temple University', 'Philadelphia, PA'] output is Philadelphia, PA, USA, input as ['Harvard University', 'Cambridge, MA, USA'] output is Cambridge, MA, USA, input as ['University of Connecticut', 'Storrs, CT, USA'] output is Storrs, CT, USA, input as ['Drexel University', 'Philadelphia, PA'] output is Philadelphia, PA, USA, input as ['New Haven University', 'New Haven, CT, USA'] output is New Haven, CT, USA, input as ['University of California, Santa Barbara', 'Santa Barbara, CA, USA'] output is Santa Barbara, CA, USA, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
