Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Summary of Input Column Data:

The input data consists of strings representing phone numbers in a specific format. Each string is a sequence of digits grouped into three distinct blocks separated by spaces. The first block contains three digits, the second block also contains three digits, and the third block contains four digits. This format follows the common North American Numbering Plan (NANP) convention but uses spaces as separators instead of dashes or parentheses commonly seen in phone number representations. The input data does not include any country codes or special characters other than spaces. Each entry in the input column represents a unique phone number.

### Summary of Output Column Data:

The output data transforms the format of the phone numbers provided in the input column. Each output string maintains the same sequence of digits as its corresponding input but alters the separators between the digit blocks. Specifically, the spaces in the input are replaced with dashes in the output, resulting in a format that is also common in representing phone numbers. The output maintains the three distinct blocks of digits: the first block with three digits, the second block with three digits, and the third block with four digits, now separated by dashes. This transformation standardizes the phone number representation, potentially making it more familiar or readable depending on the context.

### Relationship Between Input and Output:

The transformation from the input to the output column demonstrates a straightforward, consistent process of reformatting phone numbers. The essence of the transformation lies in changing the separators between the digit blocks of the phone numbers from spaces in the input to dashes in the output. The digit sequences themselves remain unchanged, ensuring that the integrity of the phone number is preserved. This process suggests an intention to standardize the format of phone numbers, possibly for aesthetic reasons, to comply with a specific formatting standard, or to ensure consistency in data presentation. The relationship between the input and output underscores a simple yet effective method of data formatting that does not alter the fundamental information but makes it more uniform and possibly easier to interpret or use in various contexts., and input as ['801 456 8756'] output is 801-456-8756, input as ['978 456 8756'] output is 978-456-8756, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
