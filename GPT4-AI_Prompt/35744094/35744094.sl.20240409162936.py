Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Summary of Input Column Data:

The input data consists of URLs from various websites, specifically focusing on major technology companies such as Apple and Microsoft. Each URL is structured to include the protocol (either HTTP or HTTPS), the domain name (e.g., www.apple.com, www.microsoft.com), an optional country code (e.g., /uk/, /en-gb/), and a path that points to a specific page or product category on the website (e.g., /mac, /windows). The structure of these URLs is consistent, starting with the protocol, followed by the domain, and ending with a specific path that denotes a product or a section of the website. The presence of a country code in the URL indicates that the content might be tailored for a specific geographic audience. The URLs are a mix of secure (HTTPS) and potentially non-secure (HTTP) connections, with modern practices favoring HTTPS for enhanced security.

### Summary of Output Column Data:

The output data extracts specific keywords from the input URLs, which represent either a product name (e.g., "mac", "windows") or the company name ("microsoft") in cases where a specific product or section isn't delineated in the URL. These keywords are significant as they directly relate to the main subject or focus of the corresponding webpage. The output simplifies the URL to its most relevant component concerning the content or product being referenced, making it easier to understand the primary focus of the webpage without needing to visit or see the full URL.

### Relationship Summary:

The relationship between the input and output data is a direct mapping of a detailed, structured URL to a simplified keyword that represents the main focus or subject of that URL. This process involves parsing the URL to extract the most relevant part that indicates the content or product focus of the webpage. The output keyword serves as a concise summary or identifier for the content expected at the given URL, effectively distilling the essence of the webpage into a single word or phrase. This relationship highlights the importance of URL structure in conveying information about webpage content and demonstrates a method for simplifying complex URLs to their core components for easier understanding and categorization., and input as ['http=//www.apple.com/uk/mac'] output is mac, input as ['https=//www.microsoft.com/en-gb/windows'] output is windows, input as ['https=//www.microsoft.com/'] output is microsoft, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
