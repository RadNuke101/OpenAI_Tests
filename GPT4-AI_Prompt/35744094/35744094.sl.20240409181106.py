Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Input Column Summary:

The input data consists of URLs from various technology companies' websites. Each URL is structured to include the protocol (either HTTP or HTTPS), followed by the domain name, which typically includes the company name (e.g., apple.com, microsoft.com), and then a path that directs to a specific section or product of the website (e.g., /uk/mac, /en-gb/windows). The URLs are diverse in their structure, indicating different regional versions (as seen with the '/uk/' and '/en-gb/' segments) and different content focuses within the same company's domain. The input data represents a qualitative snapshot of how companies organize and present their products or services online, with each URL pointing to a specific area of interest within the broader corporate website.

### Output Column Summary:

The output data consists of single-word strings that appear to represent the main subject or product focus of the URL provided in the input. These outputs are extracted from the latter part of the URL path, indicating a method of distilling the essence or primary focus of the web page into a single keyword. The keywords include 'mac', 'windows', and 'microsoft', each of which is closely associated with the respective company's product offerings or brand identity. This output data is qualitative, capturing a significant aspect of the content or purpose behind each URL in a concise format.

### Relationship Summary:

The relationship between the input and output data is characterized by a process of extracting key information or focal points from complex URLs. The output appears to be generated by identifying and isolating the most relevant part of the URL path that signifies the main content or product featured on the webpage. This process simplifies the detailed and structured information provided in the input URLs into a single, easily identifiable keyword that represents the essence of the webpage's content. The method of extraction seems to rely on parsing the URL structure to find the last significant segment of the path before any trailing slashes or parameters, which typically denotes the primary subject or product being referenced. This relationship highlights a systematic approach to summarizing web content based on URL analysis, offering a streamlined representation of what users can expect to find on the corresponding web pages., and input as ['http=//www.apple.com/uk/mac'] output is mac, input as ['https=//www.microsoft.com/en-gb/windows'] output is windows, input as ['https=//www.microsoft.com/'] output is microsoft, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
