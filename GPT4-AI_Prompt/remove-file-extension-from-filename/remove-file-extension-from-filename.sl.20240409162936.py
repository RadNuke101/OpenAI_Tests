Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Summary for Input Column Data:

The input data consists of a list of filenames, each with an extension that indicates the file type. These filenames include a variety of purposes and subjects, such as images ('.jpg'), spreadsheets ('.xls'), and data files ('.csv', '.pdf'). The filenames are descriptive of the content or purpose of the file, such as 'happy' for an image, 'pivot table' for a spreadsheet, 'sales data' for a CSV file, and 'invoice3001' for a document. The filenames may contain spaces, indicating separation between words in the description of the file's content or purpose. The extensions indicate the format of the file, which could be an image, a spreadsheet, a data file, or a document. The presence of multiple extensions (e.g., '.xls.pdf') suggests that some files may have been converted from one format to another.

### Summary for Output Column Data:

The output data consists of the descriptive part of the filenames from the input data, with the file extensions removed. This results in a cleaner, more human-readable format that focuses on the content or purpose of the file rather than its technical format. The output retains the spaces and numerical parts of the filenames, preserving the original description's integrity while omitting the technical aspects related to file format. This transformation simplifies the identification and categorization of the files based on their content or purpose.

### Relationship Between Input and Output:

The relationship between the input and output data is characterized by a process of extraction and simplification, where the descriptive part of the filename is separated from its technical file format extension. This process involves identifying the file extension (e.g., '.jpg', '.xls', '.csv', '.pdf') and removing it to focus solely on the descriptive name of the file. The transformation retains the essence of the file's identity—its content or purpose—while discarding the technical details related to its format. This simplification makes it easier to understand and communicate the nature of the files without needing to consider their technical specifications. The process demonstrates a clear mapping from a more complex, format-specific naming convention to a simplified, content-focused description, facilitating easier categorization and recognition of the files based on their intended use or content., and input as ['happy.jpg'] output is happy, input as ['pivot table.xls'] output is pivot table, input as ['sales data.csv'] output is sales data, input as ['invoice3001.xls.pdf'] output is invoice3001, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
