Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Summary of Input Column Data:

The input data consists of a series of filenames, each with a specific format that includes a name followed by a file extension. These filenames are indicative of various types of documents or images, as suggested by their extensions (e.g., .jpg, .xls, .csv, .pdf). The names of the files themselves are descriptive and seem to represent the content or purpose of the file, such as 'happy' for an image, 'pivot table' for an Excel spreadsheet, 'sales data' for a CSV file, and 'invoice3001' for a PDF document. The file extensions suggest a variety of uses, from image storage and data analysis to financial documentation. The filenames contain spaces, numbers, and sometimes a combination of more than one file extension, indicating a file conversion or a layered file format.

### Summary of Output Column Data:

The output data extracts and presents the descriptive name of each file, omitting the file extension(s). This process distills the essence or primary identifier of each file, stripping away the technical aspect of how the file is formatted or what software might be needed to open it. The output retains any spaces, numbers, or special characters that were part of the original filename, minus the extension, thus preserving the original intent or descriptive quality of the filename. This simplification allows for a focus on the content or purpose of the file rather than its format.

### Relationship Between Input and Output:

The relationship between the input and output data is a process of simplification and focus. The transformation from input to output involves removing the file extension(s), which categorize the file type, to highlight the descriptive name of the file. This process suggests that the essence or primary importance of each file lies in its content or purpose, as indicated by its name, rather than the specific format it takes. The operation assumes that the audience or users of the output data are more concerned with what the file represents (e.g., a photo named 'happy', a spreadsheet for 'pivot table', etc.) than with the technical details of how to access or use the file. This transformation facilitates easier identification and discussion of the files based on their content or purpose, streamlining communication and potentially organization of the files., and input as ['happy.jpg'] output is happy, input as ['pivot table.xls'] output is pivot table, input as ['sales data.csv'] output is sales data, input as ['invoice3001.xls.pdf'] output is invoice3001, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
