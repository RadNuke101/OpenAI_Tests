Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Summary of Input Column Data:

The input column consists of a list of filenames, each with a specific format that includes both a name and a file extension. These filenames represent a variety of document types, as indicated by their extensions, such as `.jpg` for image files, `.xls` for Excel spreadsheets, `.csv` for comma-separated values files, and `.xls.pdf`, indicating a file that may have been converted from an Excel document to a PDF. The names of the files themselves are descriptive, indicating the content or purpose of the file, such as 'happy' for an image, 'pivot table' and 'sales data' for spreadsheet documents, and 'invoice3001' for a document that likely pertains to billing or transactions. The variety in the file names and types suggests a broad range of uses and contents, from visual data and photographs to financial and tabular data.

### Summary of Output Column Data:

The output column data consists of the names of the files from the input column with the file extension removed. This process of removing the file extension simplifies the data, focusing solely on the descriptive or identifying part of the filename. The output retains the essence of the input data—its descriptive or functional identity—while discarding the technical detail of the file format. This simplification could serve various purposes, such as categorizing, labeling, or identifying the content without concern for the file type.

### Relationship Between Input and Output:

The relationship between the input and output data is characterized by a transformation process that extracts the descriptive or identifying part of a filename by removing the file extension. This process highlights the content or purpose of the file, independent of its format, suggesting that the essence or utility of the file is not inherently tied to its specific format. The transformation from input to output demonstrates a focus on the qualitative aspects of the data—what the file represents or is used for—rather than the quantitative or technical specifications (e.g., file type). This approach could be particularly useful in contexts where understanding or organizing information based on content or function is more important than the technical details of how that information is stored or presented., and input as ['happy.jpg'] output is happy, input as ['pivot table.xls'] output is pivot table, input as ['sales data.csv'] output is sales data, input as ['invoice3001.xls.pdf'] output is invoice3001, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
