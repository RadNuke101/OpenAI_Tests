Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Input Column Summary:

The input column consists of a list of filenames, each with a specific format that includes a name followed by a file extension. These filenames are indicative of various types of documents or images, as suggested by their extensions (e.g., .jpg, .xls, .csv, .pdf). The names of the files are descriptive of their content or purpose, such as 'happy' for an image, 'pivot table' and 'sales data' for spreadsheets, and 'invoice3001' for a document. The file extensions suggest the format or application associated with each file, such as JPEG for images, Excel for spreadsheets (.xls), CSV for comma-separated values files, and PDF for portable document format files. The filenames may contain spaces, numbers, and multiple extensions, indicating a complex naming convention that could include versioning or file conversion history (e.g., 'invoice3001.xls.pdf').

### Output Column Summary:

The output column contains the names extracted from the filenames in the input column, with the file extensions removed. This results in a cleaner, more readable version of each filename that focuses solely on the descriptive or identifying part of the name, without the technical details of the file format. The output retains spaces and numbers present in the original filenames, preserving the essential characteristics of each name while omitting the file extension.

### Relationship Between Input and Output:

The relationship between the input and output columns is a process of extraction and simplification, where the descriptive or identifying part of each filename is separated from its technical file extension. This process involves identifying the file extension (denoted by the period character '.' followed by the extension) and removing it to isolate the name of the file. The transformation retains the original integrity of the filename's descriptive or identifying information while discarding the file format details, which may not be necessary for certain contexts where the content or purpose of the file is more relevant than its format. This simplification can facilitate easier identification, categorization, or discussion of the files based on their content or purpose without the need to consider their technical specifications., and input as ['happy.jpg'] output is happy, input as ['pivot table.xls'] output is pivot table, input as ['sales data.csv'] output is sales data, input as ['invoice3001.xls.pdf'] output is invoice3001, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
