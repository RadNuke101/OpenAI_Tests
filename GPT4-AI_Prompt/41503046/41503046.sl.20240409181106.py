Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Input Column Summary:

The input column consists of a list of scientific names for various plant species. These names follow the binomial nomenclature system, which is a formal system of naming species of living things by giving each a name composed of two parts, both of which use Latin grammatical forms. The first part of the name identifies the genus to which the species belongs, while the second part identifies the species within the genus. Some entries in the input column also include the subspecies designation, following the species name, denoted by "ssp." This indicates a further division within a species that is recognized as a distinct unit.

### Output Column Summary:

The output column simplifies the scientific names provided in the input column by either retaining just the genus name or, in cases where the subspecies designation is included, by combining the genus and species names but omitting the subspecies designation. This simplification process results in a shorter, less specific name that still allows for the identification of the plant to a certain taxonomic level, but with less precision than the full scientific name. The output names are still in Latin, adhering to the binomial or trinomial nomenclature system, depending on whether the subspecies information was initially included.

### Relationship Summary:

The relationship between the input and output columns demonstrates a systematic approach to simplifying plant names from their full scientific designation to a more general identification. This process involves:

1. **For species without subspecies designation:** The output retains only the genus part of the name, dropping the species identifier. This simplification suggests a focus on broader categorization rather than specific identification.

2. **For species with subspecies designation:** The output includes both the genus and species names but omits the subspecies designation. This indicates a middle ground between the specific identification provided by the full scientific name and the broader categorization achieved by using only the genus name.

This systematic approach to simplification helps in categorizing plants into more general groups, which can be useful for various purposes, such as educational materials, general plant guides, or when specific subspecies identification is not necessary. The relationship highlights a method of reducing complexity in plant names while maintaining a level of specificity that is useful for identifying plants within broader categories., and input as ['Polygonum amphibium'] output is Polygonum, input as ['Hippuris vulgaris'] output is Hippuris, input as ['Lysimachia vulgaris'] output is Lysimachia, input as ['Juncus bulbosus ssp. bulbosus'] output is Juncus bulbosus, input as ['Lycopus europaeus ssp. europaeus'] output is Lycopus europaeus, input as ['Nymphaea alba'] output is Nymphaea, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
