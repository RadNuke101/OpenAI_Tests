Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Summary of Input Column Data:

The input data consists of a list of botanical names, each representing a specific species or subspecies of plants. These names are structured in a hierarchical manner, following the binomial nomenclature system (or trinomial for subspecies), which is a formal system of naming species of living things. The names are composed of two or three parts: the first part indicates the genus to which the species belongs, the second part is the specific epithet that distinguishes the species within the genus, and the third part (if present) indicates the subspecies. The examples provided include a mix of species and subspecies from various plant genera, such as Polygonum, Hippuris, Lysimachia, Juncus, Lycopus, and Nymphaea. These plants belong to different families and are likely to have diverse ecological roles and habitats. The input data reflects the diversity within the plant kingdom and highlights the specificity and precision of botanical nomenclature.

### Summary of Output Column Data:

The output data simplifies the botanical names provided in the input by either retaining just the genus name or, in cases where subspecies are mentioned, including both the genus and species names but omitting the subspecies designation. This simplification process reduces the specificity of the names, making them more general and accessible. For species names, the output captures the genus to which each plant belongs, while for subspecies, it maintains a level of specificity slightly higher than just the genus but less detailed than the full trinomial name. This approach balances between general classification and specific identification, making the information potentially more useful for a broader audience or for contexts where subspecies-level distinction is not critical.

### Relationship Summary:

The transformation from the input to the output data represents a systematic simplification of botanical nomenclature, focusing on the level of detail that is most relevant for general identification purposes. By reducing the names to either the genus alone or the genus plus species (excluding subspecies), the output makes the botanical names more accessible and easier to remember, while still retaining enough detail to be informative about the plant's identity. This process reflects an understanding of the hierarchical nature of biological classification and the importance of genus and species levels in conveying meaningful information about plant identity and relationships. The relationship between the input and output data underscores the balance between specificity and generalization in communicating botanical information, catering to different needs and contexts in which such information might be used., and input as ['Polygonum amphibium'] output is Polygonum, input as ['Hippuris vulgaris'] output is Hippuris, input as ['Lysimachia vulgaris'] output is Lysimachia, input as ['Juncus bulbosus ssp. bulbosus'] output is Juncus bulbosus, input as ['Lycopus europaeus ssp. europaeus'] output is Lycopus europaeus, input as ['Nymphaea alba'] output is Nymphaea, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
