Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Summary of Input Column Data:

The input data consists of a list of scientific names for various plant species. These names are structured in a binomial (or trinomial in some cases) format, which is a standard in biological nomenclature. The first part of each name represents the genus to which the plant belongs, and the second part (and third, when present) specifies the species and, if applicable, the subspecies. The dataset includes a variety of genera, such as *Polygonum*, *Hippuris*, *Lysimachia*, *Juncus*, *Lycopus*, and *Nymphaea*, among others. Some entries specify the subspecies level, indicated by the inclusion of "ssp." followed by the subspecies name, which is a further classification within the species.

### Summary of Output Column Data:

The output data simplifies the input scientific names into either just the genus name or a combination of the genus and species names, depending on the specificity required by the context. When the input includes a subspecies designation (indicated by "ssp."), the output retains both the genus and species names but omits the subspecies level, streamlining the information while still providing a specific enough identification for most practical purposes. This approach balances the need for specificity with the goal of simplification, making the information more accessible for general use.

### Relationship Summary:

The transformation from the input to the output data demonstrates a process of simplification and standardization of plant names. This process involves:

1. **Removing Subspecies Information:** When the input specifies a subspecies, the output omits this level of detail, focusing instead on the genus and species, which are generally sufficient for identifying the plant in a broad range of contexts.

2. **Simplifying to Genus or Genus-Species:** The output either simplifies the name to just the genus or retains the genus-species combination. This decision seems to be based on the presence of subspecies information in the input; if subspecies are mentioned, the genus-species is used, otherwise, just the genus.

This relationship indicates an effort to make botanical nomenclature more accessible by reducing the complexity of the names while retaining enough detail to accurately identify the plants. This approach is beneficial for non-specialist audiences or in contexts where the detailed subspecies information is not necessary., and input as ['Polygonum amphibium'] output is Polygonum, input as ['Hippuris vulgaris'] output is Hippuris, input as ['Lysimachia vulgaris'] output is Lysimachia, input as ['Juncus bulbosus ssp. bulbosus'] output is Juncus bulbosus, input as ['Lycopus europaeus ssp. europaeus'] output is Lycopus europaeus, input as ['Nymphaea alba'] output is Nymphaea, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
