Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Input Column Summary:

The input data appears to be a single column consisting of strings that follow a specific pattern. Each string seems to be a composite of different pieces of information, likely related to media (such as movies or events), separated by equal signs and other characters. The initial segment of each string before the first equal sign appears to be a title or name, possibly of a movie, event, or similar entity. This is followed by a series of numbers and values separated by equal signs, which could represent various attributes or metadata related to the initial title or name. The exact meaning of these numbers and values is not specified, but they could potentially represent dates, ratings, durations, or other relevant metrics. The structure is consistent across examples, suggesting a standardized format for encoding multiple pieces of information within a single string.

### Output Column Summary:

The output data is a simplified extraction from the input data, specifically the initial segment of each input string before the first equal sign. This output represents a cleaner, more focused dataset that isolates the title or name from the composite string in the input. By extracting this segment, the output provides a distilled view that highlights the primary subject of each input string, removing the additional, detailed metadata to focus solely on the name or title.

### Relationship Between Input and Output:

The relationship between the input and output data is a process of simplification and extraction. The output is derived directly from the input by isolating and extracting the initial segment of each input string, which is the title or name of the subject being described. This process strips away the complex, detailed metadata encoded in the input strings, leaving only the most essential piece of information for each entry. The transformation from input to output serves to create a more accessible and straightforward dataset, focusing on the core identity of each subject without the additional layers of information present in the input. This simplification could be particularly useful for applications or analyses where the primary interest is in the subjects themselves, rather than the detailed attributes or metrics associated with them., and input as ['valentine day=1915=50==7.1=45'] output is valentine day, input as ['movie blah=2blahblah, The=1914=54==7.9=17'] output is movie blah=2blahblah, The, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
