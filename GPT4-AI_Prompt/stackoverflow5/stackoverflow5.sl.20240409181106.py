Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Input Column Summary:

The input data appears to be a string that contains multiple pieces of information separated by equal signs (`=`) and commas. The structure of the input data suggests a pattern where each entry starts with a title or a name (e.g., "valentine day", "movie blah=2blahblah, The"), followed by a series of values that are likely to represent specific attributes or metrics related to the title. These attributes or metrics are separated by equal signs, and in some cases, additional information is appended after the title, separated by commas. The data seems to mix textual and numerical information, with the titles being more descriptive and the subsequent values possibly representing dates, ratings, counts, or other numerical measures. The presence of multiple equal signs and the variation in the structure indicate a complex encoding of information within each string.

### Output Column Summary:

The output data extracted from the input strings focuses solely on the initial title or name part of each input entry. This suggests that the output is intended to capture the primary identifier or descriptive name from the complex input string, discarding the numerical and possibly less descriptive data that follows. The output retains the textual content up to the first equal sign or comma, which in the context of these examples, represents a name or title. This simplification process extracts what could be considered the most human-readable or recognizable part of the input data, making it easier to understand or categorize at a glance.

### Relationship Between Input and Output:

The relationship between the input and output data is a process of simplification and extraction. The input data's complexity, with its mix of text and numbers along with a structured yet dense encoding, is distilled into a more straightforward and accessible form in the output. This transformation process effectively filters out the detailed attributes or metrics associated with each title, focusing instead on identifying and presenting the core descriptive element. The output serves as a summary or headline of each input entry, providing a quick reference to the subject matter without delving into the specifics of the data encoded in the rest of the input string. This relationship highlights a method for reducing detailed or complex information into its essential components, making it more manageable and easier to comprehend at a glance., and input as ['valentine day=1915=50==7.1=45'] output is valentine day, input as ['movie blah=2blahblah, The=1914=54==7.9=17'] output is movie blah=2blahblah, The, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
