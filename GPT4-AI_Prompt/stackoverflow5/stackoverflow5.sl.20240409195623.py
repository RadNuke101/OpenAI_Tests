Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Input Column Summary:

The input data appears to be a structured string that contains multiple pieces of information separated by specific delimiters, such as '=', ',', and '=='. Each input string begins with a descriptive phrase, which could be a name or title (e.g., "valentine day", "movie blah=2blahblah, The"). Following this initial phrase, there are several other pieces of data, separated by the delimiters mentioned. These pieces of data seem to follow a pattern, potentially including dates (e.g., "1915", "1914"), numerical values (e.g., "50", "54"), and other figures (e.g., "7.1", "7.9"). The structure suggests a standardized format, possibly representing metadata about an item or event, such as a movie or a significant date, with attributes like year, numerical ratings, or identifiers following the title or description.

### Output Column Summary:

The output data consists of the initial descriptive phrase or title from each input string, extracted as a standalone piece of information. This output effectively isolates the name or title from the structured input, removing all subsequent numerical and structured data to leave only the descriptive text. The output serves as a simplified reference or identifier for each input item, stripping away the detailed attributes to focus solely on the name or title component.

### Relationship Between Input and Output:

The relationship between the input and output data is a process of extraction and simplification. The output is derived by isolating and removing the initial descriptive phrase or title from the more complex and structured input string. This process transforms a detailed and multifaceted piece of data into a simplified, easily identifiable descriptor. The transformation suggests a focus on categorization or identification based on the descriptive titles, potentially for purposes such as indexing, summarization, or highlighting key information without the need for detailed analysis of the full structured data. The method of extraction indicates an understanding of the input format and an ability to selectively parse and extract relevant pieces of information based on their position and the delimiters that separate different data segments., and input as ['valentine day=1915=50==7.1=45'] output is valentine day, input as ['movie blah=2blahblah, The=1914=54==7.9=17'] output is movie blah=2blahblah, The, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
