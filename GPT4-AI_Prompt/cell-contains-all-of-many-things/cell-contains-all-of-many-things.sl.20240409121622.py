Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Input Column Summary:

The input data consists of two distinct parts: a primary sentence and a set of keywords. The primary sentence describes a scene or situation, often involving colors and objects or entities. The keywords are specific words that are expected to be found within the primary sentence. These keywords typically include colors and nouns, which are crucial elements within the described scenes. The sentences vary in context, ranging from animals on colored backgrounds to objects situated in environments with specified colors. The keywords are consistent in their role as descriptors or subjects within the sentences, aiming to highlight particular elements of interest.

### Output Column Summary:

The output data is binary, represented as either true or false. This binary output signifies whether the set of keywords provided with each primary sentence are all present within that sentence. A true output indicates that all keywords are found within the sentence, suggesting a direct correlation between the presence of these keywords and the output. Conversely, a false output denotes that at least one of the specified keywords is missing from the sentence, breaking the direct correlation between the specified keywords and their presence in the sentence.

### Relationship Summary:

The relationship between the input and output data hinges on the presence and identification of specific keywords within the primary sentences. When all keywords are found within a sentence, the relationship is affirmed with a true output, indicating a successful match. This suggests that the output serves as an indicator of the completeness of the keyword set within the context of the sentence. The essence of this relationship is the validation of keyword presence, which directly influences the binary outcome. The process essentially evaluates the sentences for the inclusion of specified elements (keywords), with the output serving as a straightforward validation check. This relationship underscores the importance of keyword relevance and presence within textual data, providing a clear, binary assessment of content alignment with specified criteria., and input as ['yellow dog on green grass', 'yellow', 'green', 'dog'] output is true, input as ['Lone dog with a green frisbie on yellow sand', 'yellow', 'green', 'dog'] output is true, input as ['A yellow sun in a green field', 'yellow', 'green', 'dog'] output is false, input as ['yellow neon sign with a green background', 'yellow', 'green', 'dog'] output is false, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
