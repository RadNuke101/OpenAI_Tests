Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Input Column Summary:

The input data consists of a list of full names, each entry containing a first name followed by a last name. These names represent a diverse set of individuals, likely from various cultural and ethnic backgrounds, as indicated by the variety in the structure and phonetics of the last names. Each entry is structured in a consistent format, with the first name followed by the last name, separated by a space. The names appear to be of adults, given the formal structure and the absence of diminutive or informal versions of first names.

### Output Column Summary:

The output data extracts and presents the last name from each full name provided in the input column. This process of extraction indicates a focus on identifying individuals by their family names or surnames, which could be relevant in contexts where the uniqueness or heritage of the last name is of interest. The output retains the diversity and cultural representation seen in the input data, emphasizing the last names without altering their spelling or structure.

### Relationship Summary:

The relationship between the input and output data is a direct extraction process, where the output isolates and presents the second part of each full name from the input. This indicates a systematic method of parsing the full names to retrieve only the last names, suggesting an underlying algorithm or rule-based system capable of identifying and separating the components of a full name based on a predefined structure (first name followed by last name). The purpose behind this extraction could be for applications requiring emphasis on familial or cultural lineage, sorting, or categorization based on last names, or for simplifying records by focusing on the potentially more unique component of a person's name. This process underscores the importance or relevance of last names in the specific context for which the data is being prepared., and input as ['Nancy FreeHafer'] output is FreeHafer, input as ['Andrew Cencici'] output is Cencici, input as ['Jan Kotas'] output is Kotas, input as ['Mariya Sergienko'] output is Sergienko, input as ['Launa Withers'] output is Withers, input as ['Lakenya Edison'] output is Edison, input as ['Brendan Hage'] output is Hage, input as ['Bradford Lango'] output is Lango, input as ['Rudolf Akiyama'] output is Akiyama, input as ['Lara Constable'] output is Constable, input as ['Madelaine Ghoston'] output is Ghoston, input as ['Salley Hornak'] output is Hornak, input as ['Micha Junkin'] output is Junkin, input as ['Teddy Bobo'] output is Bobo, input as ['Coralee Scalia'] output is Scalia, input as ['Jeff Quashie'] output is Quashie, input as ['Vena Babiarz'] output is Babiarz, input as ['Karrie Lain'] output is Lain, input as ['Tobias Dermody'] output is Dermody, input as ['Celsa Hopkins'] output is Hopkins, input as ['Kimberley Halpern'] output is Halpern, input as ['Phillip Rowden'] output is Rowden, input as ['Elias Neil'] output is Neil, input as ['Lashanda Cortes'] output is Cortes, input as ['Mackenzie Spell'] output is Spell, input as ['Kathlyn Eccleston'] output is Eccleston, input as ['Georgina Brescia'] output is Brescia, input as ['Beata Miah'] output is Miah, input as ['Desiree Seamons'] output is Seamons, input as ['Jeanice Soderstrom'] output is Soderstrom, input as ['Mariel Jurgens'] output is Jurgens, input as ['Alida Bogle'] output is Bogle, input as ['Jacqualine Olague'] output is Olague, input as ['Joaquin Clasen'] output is Clasen, input as ['Samuel Richert'] output is Richert, input as ['Malissa Marcus'] output is Marcus, input as ['Alaina Partida'] output is Partida, input as ['Trinidad Mulloy'] output is Mulloy, input as ['Carlene Garrard'] output is Garrard, input as ['Melodi Chism'] output is Chism, input as ['Bess Chilcott'] output is Chilcott, input as ['Chong Aylward'] output is Aylward, input as ['Jani Ramthun'] output is Ramthun, input as ['Jacquiline Heintz'] output is Heintz, input as ['Hayley Marquess'] output is Marquess, input as ['Andria Spagnoli'] output is Spagnoli, input as ['Irwin Covelli'] output is Covelli, input as ['Gertude Montiel'] output is Montiel, input as ['Stefany Reily'] output is Reily, input as ['Rae Mcgaughey'] output is Mcgaughey, input as ['Cruz Latimore'] output is Latimore, input as ['Maryann Casler'] output is Casler, input as ['Annalisa Gregori'] output is Gregori, input as ['Jenee Pannell'] output is Pannell, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
