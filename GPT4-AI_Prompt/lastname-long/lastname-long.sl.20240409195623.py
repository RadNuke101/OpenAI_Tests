Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Input Column Summary:

The input column consists of a list of full names, each entry containing a first name followed by a last name. These names represent a diverse array of backgrounds, indicated by the variety of surnames. The structure of each entry is consistent, with names being separated by a space. The first names vary widely, suggesting no specific pattern or preference towards gender, origin, or ethnicity. The dataset appears to be a collection of individual identities, possibly representing a sample from a larger population or a list from a specific context, such as a membership roster, customer list, or participant directory.

### Output Column Summary:

The output column contains only the last names extracted from the full names provided in the input column. This extraction process has reduced the data to a single identifying component of each individual, focusing on the surname. The diversity in the surnames is preserved, reflecting the variety seen in the input data. This simplification to just last names could serve purposes such as creating lists where unique identification is necessary but full names are not required, or for sorting, categorization, and analysis where the primary interest is in family names or patterns therein.

### Relationship Between Input and Output:

The relationship between the input and output data is a direct extraction process where the last name of each full name in the input column is isolated and presented as the output. This transformation from full names to just surnames simplifies the data while retaining a key piece of identity information. The process suggests a focus on the part of the name that often carries significance in terms of heritage, family lineage, and cultural identity. This method of data processing could be useful in contexts where the specific identity of individuals is less important than the broader categorizations or affiliations that surnames might represent. It also streamlines the dataset for tasks that require less personal detail while still needing to distinguish between individuals., and input as ['Nancy FreeHafer'] output is FreeHafer, input as ['Andrew Cencici'] output is Cencici, input as ['Jan Kotas'] output is Kotas, input as ['Mariya Sergienko'] output is Sergienko, input as ['Launa Withers'] output is Withers, input as ['Lakenya Edison'] output is Edison, input as ['Brendan Hage'] output is Hage, input as ['Bradford Lango'] output is Lango, input as ['Rudolf Akiyama'] output is Akiyama, input as ['Lara Constable'] output is Constable, input as ['Madelaine Ghoston'] output is Ghoston, input as ['Salley Hornak'] output is Hornak, input as ['Micha Junkin'] output is Junkin, input as ['Teddy Bobo'] output is Bobo, input as ['Coralee Scalia'] output is Scalia, input as ['Jeff Quashie'] output is Quashie, input as ['Vena Babiarz'] output is Babiarz, input as ['Karrie Lain'] output is Lain, input as ['Tobias Dermody'] output is Dermody, input as ['Celsa Hopkins'] output is Hopkins, input as ['Kimberley Halpern'] output is Halpern, input as ['Phillip Rowden'] output is Rowden, input as ['Elias Neil'] output is Neil, input as ['Lashanda Cortes'] output is Cortes, input as ['Mackenzie Spell'] output is Spell, input as ['Kathlyn Eccleston'] output is Eccleston, input as ['Georgina Brescia'] output is Brescia, input as ['Beata Miah'] output is Miah, input as ['Desiree Seamons'] output is Seamons, input as ['Jeanice Soderstrom'] output is Soderstrom, input as ['Mariel Jurgens'] output is Jurgens, input as ['Alida Bogle'] output is Bogle, input as ['Jacqualine Olague'] output is Olague, input as ['Joaquin Clasen'] output is Clasen, input as ['Samuel Richert'] output is Richert, input as ['Malissa Marcus'] output is Marcus, input as ['Alaina Partida'] output is Partida, input as ['Trinidad Mulloy'] output is Mulloy, input as ['Carlene Garrard'] output is Garrard, input as ['Melodi Chism'] output is Chism, input as ['Bess Chilcott'] output is Chilcott, input as ['Chong Aylward'] output is Aylward, input as ['Jani Ramthun'] output is Ramthun, input as ['Jacquiline Heintz'] output is Heintz, input as ['Hayley Marquess'] output is Marquess, input as ['Andria Spagnoli'] output is Spagnoli, input as ['Irwin Covelli'] output is Covelli, input as ['Gertude Montiel'] output is Montiel, input as ['Stefany Reily'] output is Reily, input as ['Rae Mcgaughey'] output is Mcgaughey, input as ['Cruz Latimore'] output is Latimore, input as ['Maryann Casler'] output is Casler, input as ['Annalisa Gregori'] output is Gregori, input as ['Jenee Pannell'] output is Pannell, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
