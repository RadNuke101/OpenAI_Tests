Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Input Column Summary:

The input data consists of two parts: a fixed sentence "you can do anything but you cant do everything." and a variable, which is a number represented as a string. The sentence remains constant across all examples, while the number changes. This number appears to signify a position or an index within the given sentence when considering the sentence as a sequence of words. The variability in the input data is solely due to the changing numerical value, which ranges from '1' to '4' in the provided examples. This suggests that the input data is designed to explore different segments or components of the sentence based on the numerical index.

### Output Column Summary:

The output data consists of single words extracted from the fixed sentence provided in the input data. Each output corresponds directly to the numerical value given in the input, indicating that the number serves as an index to select a specific word from the sentence. The sequence of outputs ("anything", "you", "can", "do") reflects the extraction of words based on their positional order within the sentence, starting from the first word when the index is '1'. This demonstrates a clear, deterministic relationship between the numerical index in the input and the word extracted in the output.

### Relationship Summary:

The relationship between the input and output data is characterized by a positional mapping mechanism, where the numerical value in the input serves as an index to select a word from the fixed sentence. This mapping is direct and consistent, indicating a rule-based extraction process. The input number determines which word from the sentence is outputted, following a simple rule: the number corresponds to the position of the word in the sentence, considering a 1-based indexing system. This relationship highlights a straightforward, predictable pattern of data transformation, where the variability in the output is directly controlled by the numerical index provided in the input., and input as ['you can do anything but you cant do everything.', '4'] output is anything, input as ['you can do anything but you cant do everything.', '1'] output is you, input as ['you can do anything but you cant do everything.', '2'] output is can, input as ['you can do anything but you cant do everything.', '3'] output is do, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
