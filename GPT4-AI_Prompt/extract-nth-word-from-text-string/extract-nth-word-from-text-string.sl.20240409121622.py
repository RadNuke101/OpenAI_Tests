Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Input Column Summary:

The input data consists of two distinct parts: a fixed sentence and a variable number that changes across different inputs. The sentence is "you can do anything but you can't do everything." This sentence remains constant across all inputs, serving as a base for the operation. The second part of the input is a numerical value that varies across different inputs, represented as '4', '1', '2', and '3' in the provided examples. This numerical value is crucial as it directly influences the output.

### Output Column Summary:

The output data is a sequence of words extracted from the fixed sentence provided in the input. Each output corresponds to a specific position within the sentence, as determined by the numerical value in the input. For instance, 'anything' corresponds to the position indicated by '4', 'you' by '1', 'can' by '2', and 'do' by '3'. The output showcases a direct relationship with the numerical part of the input, where each number acts as an index to retrieve a specific word from the sentence.

### Relationship Summary:

The relationship between the input and output is governed by a positional mapping mechanism, where the numerical value in the input serves as an index to select a word from the given sentence. This process is consistent and predictable, indicating a clear, linear relationship between the numerical part of the input and the output word. The fixed sentence in the input acts as a pool from which words are extracted based on their position in the sentence, as dictated by the numerical index provided alongside. This setup suggests a straightforward, index-based retrieval system where the input number directly determines the output word, showcasing a simple yet effective method of data extraction and manipulation., and input as ['you can do anything but you cant do everything.', '4'] output is anything, input as ['you can do anything but you cant do everything.', '1'] output is you, input as ['you can do anything but you cant do everything.', '2'] output is can, input as ['you can do anything but you cant do everything.', '3'] output is do, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
