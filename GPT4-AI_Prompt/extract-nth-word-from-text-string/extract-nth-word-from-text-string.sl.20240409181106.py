Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Input Column Summary:

The input data consists of two distinct parts: a fixed sentence and a variable number that changes across different inputs. The sentence for all inputs remains constant: "you can do anything but you can't do everything." This sentence is composed of several words, each potentially representing a unique element when considered in isolation. The variable part of the input is a number that changes with each input instance. This number appears to serve as an index or a selector that determines which part of the fixed sentence is focused upon or extracted in the process.

### Output Column Summary:

The output data is a series of words, each corresponding to a specific input instance. These words are directly extracted from the fixed sentence provided in the input data. The relationship between the input number and the output word suggests that the number serves as a positional indicator, guiding which word from the fixed sentence is to be selected and presented as the output. The sequence of outputs ("anything," "you," "can," "do") indicates a direct mapping from the numerical value provided in the input to the position of words in the sentence, following a standard order of enumeration starting from the beginning of the sentence.

### Relationship Summary:

The relationship between the input and output data is characterized by a selection mechanism where the input number acts as a key to extract a specific word from the fixed sentence. This process can be understood as a form of indexing, where the input number corresponds to the position of a word within the given sentence, adhering to a one-based indexing system. The output is thus a direct reflection of this indexing operation, showcasing a clear, deterministic relationship between the numerical value provided in the input and the word's position in the sentence. This mechanism highlights a straightforward, rule-based interaction between the input numbers and the sentence structure, leading to the generation of the output words., and input as ['you can do anything but you cant do everything.', '4'] output is anything, input as ['you can do anything but you cant do everything.', '1'] output is you, input as ['you can do anything but you cant do everything.', '2'] output is can, input as ['you can do anything but you cant do everything.', '3'] output is do, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
