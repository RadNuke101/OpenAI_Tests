Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Summary of Input Column Data:

The input data consists of two columns. The first column contains the names of various universities and colleges, which include a mix of full names and abbreviations. These institutions are located across the United States and are recognized for their academic contributions. The names mentioned range from prestigious Ivy League schools like Yale University and Columbia University to large public research universities such as the University of Michigan and UC Berkeley. Additionally, there are technical institutes like MIT and specialized institutions like NYU. This variety showcases the diversity of higher education institutions in the U.S.

The second column provides the geographical locations of these institutions, specified by the city and state. In some instances, the country (USA) is also included, while in others, it is omitted. This column highlights the wide geographical spread of these institutions, covering both coasts, the Midwest, and southern states, reflecting the broad accessibility of higher education across different regions of the United States.

### Summary of Output Column Data:

The output data standardizes the format of the geographical locations associated with each institution mentioned in the input. Regardless of whether the original input included the country name, the output consistently appends ", USA" to each location if it was not already present. This standardization process ensures clarity and uniformity in identifying that all these institutions are located within the United States. The output retains the city and state information as provided in the input, ensuring that the specific locations of these institutions are accurately represented.

### Relationship Summary:

The relationship between the input and output data demonstrates a process of standardization and clarification of geographical information associated with various higher education institutions in the United States. The input data, which varies in the level of detail provided for each institution's location, is processed to produce an output that uniformly includes the country name, thereby eliminating any ambiguity regarding the institutions' locations. This transformation is particularly useful for contexts where the audience may not be familiar with the U.S. state abbreviations or where global clarity is required. The output makes it explicitly clear that all mentioned institutions are located in the USA, facilitating a better understanding of the geographical landscape of higher education in the country., and input as ['UC Berkeley', 'Berkeley, CA'] output is Berkeley, CA, USA, input as ['University of Pennsylvania', 'Phialdelphia, PA, USA'] output is Phialdelphia, PA, USA, input as ['Cornell University', 'Ithaca, New York, USA'] output is Ithaca, New York, USA, input as ['Penn', 'Philadelphia, PA, USA'] output is Philadelphia, PA, USA, input as ['University of Michigan', 'Ann Arbor, MI, USA'] output is Ann Arbor, MI, USA, input as ['UC Berkeley', 'Berkeley, CA'] output is Berkeley, CA, USA, input as ['MIT', 'Cambridge, MA'] output is Cambridge, MA, USA, input as ['University of Pennsylvania', 'Phialdelphia, PA, USA'] output is Phialdelphia, PA, USA, input as ['UCLA', 'Los Angeles, CA'] output is Los Angeles, CA, USA, input as ['University of Maryland College Park', 'College Park, MD'] output is College Park, MD, USA, input as ['University of Michigan', 'Ann Arbor, MI, USA'] output is Ann Arbor, MI, USA, input as ['UC Berkeley', 'Berkeley, CA'] output is Berkeley, CA, USA, input as ['MIT', 'Cambridge, MA'] output is Cambridge, MA, USA, input as ['Rice University', 'Houston, TX'] output is Houston, TX, USA, input as ['Yale University', 'New Haven, CT, USA'] output is New Haven, CT, USA, input as ['Columbia University', 'New York, NY, USA'] output is New York, NY, USA, input as ['NYU', 'New York, New York, USA'] output is New York, New York, USA, input as ['Drexel University', 'Philadelphia, PA'] output is Philadelphia, PA, USA, input as ['UC Berkeley', 'Berkeley, CA'] output is Berkeley, CA, USA, input as ['UIUC', 'Urbana, IL'] output is Urbana, IL, USA, input as ['Temple University', 'Philadelphia, PA'] output is Philadelphia, PA, USA, input as ['Harvard University', 'Cambridge, MA, USA'] output is Cambridge, MA, USA, input as ['University of Connecticut', 'Storrs, CT, USA'] output is Storrs, CT, USA, input as ['Drexel University', 'Philadelphia, PA'] output is Philadelphia, PA, USA, input as ['NYU', 'New York, New York, USA'] output is New York, New York, USA, input as ['UIUC', 'Urbana, IL'] output is Urbana, IL, USA, input as ['New Haven University', 'New Haven, CT, USA'] output is New Haven, CT, USA, input as ['University of California, Santa Barbara', 'Santa Barbara, CA, USA'] output is Santa Barbara, CA, USA, input as ['University of Connecticut', 'Storrs, CT, USA'] output is Storrs, CT, USA, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
