Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: To generate summaries for each input column and the output column based on the provided examples, we first need to understand the nature of the data and its structure. The examples given are key-value pairs, where the key represents a characteristic of a vehicle (e.g., year, make, model, fuel economy), and the value provides specific information about that characteristic. The output is the value part of these pairs, which varies depending on the characteristic being described.

### Input Column Summaries

1. **Year**: This column contains the production year of the vehicle. It's a temporal attribute that can help in understanding the age of the vehicle, potential technological features, and possibly its value. The data type for this column is typically numeric, representing specific years (e.g., 2016).

2. **Make**: This column specifies the manufacturer or brand of the vehicle. It's a categorical attribute that can be crucial for identifying the vehicle's market segment, reliability, and overall reputation. The data type for this column is textual (e.g., Subaru).

3. **Model**: This column provides the specific model name or designation of the vehicle, which can include additional descriptors like body style (e.g., Outback Wagon). It's a detailed categorical attribute that helps in pinpointing the exact variant of the vehicle, its features, and potential market value. The data type is textual and can include both letters and numbers.

4. **Fuel Economy**: This column indicates the vehicle's fuel efficiency, often given in miles per gallon (MPG) for city/highway driving (e.g., 25/33). It's a compound numerical attribute that can influence buyer decisions based on fuel consumption and cost. The data type is typically a fractional or decimal number, sometimes presented as a range or dual values for different driving conditions.

### Output Column Summary

The output column directly reflects the values from the input columns, which vary widely in type and format, including numeric years, textual brand names, model designations, and fractional fuel economy figures. The output is essentially the specific information or characteristic of the vehicle being described by each input column. It serves as a direct reflection of the vehicle's attributes, providing detailed insights into its age, make, model, and efficiency.

### Relationship Between Input and Output

The relationship between the input and output is a straightforward mapping where each input column name (key) identifies a specific characteristic of a vehicle, and the output (value) provides the detailed information for that characteristic. This structure allows for a modular and flexible representation of vehicle data, where each pair of input and output provides a complete piece of information about the vehicle. The input columns categorize the vehicle's attributes into distinct aspects, while the output fills in the specific details for those aspects, together offering a comprehensive profile of the vehicle., and input as ['year= 2016'] output is 2016, input as ['make= subaru'] output is subaru, input as ['model= outback wagon'] output is outback wagon, input as ['fuel economy= 25/33'] output is 25/33, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
