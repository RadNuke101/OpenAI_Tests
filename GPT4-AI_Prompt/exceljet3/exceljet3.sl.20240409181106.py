Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: To generate summaries for each input column and the output column, we'll first identify the nature of the data in each column based on the examples provided, and then describe the relationship between the inputs and the output. The examples given are:

1. `['year= 2016']` output is 2016
2. `['make= subaru']` output is subaru
3. `['model= outback wagon']` output is outback wagon
4. `['fuel economy= 25/33']` output is 25/33

### Input Column Summaries:

1. **Year Column**: This column contains the year of manufacture for a vehicle. The data is qualitative, representing a specific point in time but used here to categorize vehicles into their respective production years. It's a numeric representation but treated qualitatively in this context.

2. **Make Column**: This column specifies the manufacturer or brand of the vehicle. It is a qualitative descriptor that categorizes vehicles by their brand identity, which can be indicative of certain qualities, reputations, or types of vehicles associated with the brand.

3. **Model Column**: This column describes the specific model of the vehicle, which is a qualitative descriptor. It provides more detailed categorization within a brand, indicating specific designs, features, or variants offered by the manufacturer.

4. **Fuel Economy Column**: This column presents the fuel economy of the vehicle, typically in miles per gallon (MPG), showing a range from city to highway driving conditions. While the data could be seen as quantitative, in this context, it's treated qualitatively to categorize vehicles by their fuel efficiency characteristics.

### Output Column Summary:

The output column directly mirrors the input data, providing a specific value for each of the input categories (year, make, model, fuel economy). The output is qualitative, serving to categorize or describe specific aspects of a vehicle based on the input column it corresponds to.

### Relationship Between Input and Output:

The relationship between the input columns and the output is a direct mapping, where each input column's data is reflected in the output without transformation or interpretation. This suggests that the purpose of the output is to extract and highlight specific qualitative characteristics of vehicles based on the input provided. Each input column focuses on a different aspect of vehicle categorization (e.g., time of production, brand, model, efficiency), and the output serves to isolate and present that aspect explicitly. This direct mapping indicates a straightforward relationship aimed at data extraction and categorization rather than analysis or synthesis of new information., and input as ['year= 2016'] output is 2016, input as ['make= subaru'] output is subaru, input as ['model= outback wagon'] output is outback wagon, input as ['fuel economy= 25/33'] output is 25/33, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
