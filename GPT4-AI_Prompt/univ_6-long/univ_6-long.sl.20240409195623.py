Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Input Column Summary:

The input data consists of two primary columns. The first column contains the names of various universities and colleges, which include a mix of full names and abbreviations. These institutions are located across the United States and are recognized for their academic contributions. The names range from prestigious Ivy League schools like "Yale University" and "Harvard University" to large public research universities such as "University of Michigan" and "UC Berkeley". The diversity in the names also includes technical institutes like "MIT" and specialized institutions like "Rice University".

The second column provides the geographical locations of these institutions. These locations are specified with varying degrees of detail, including city and state, with some entries also including the country ("USA"). In a few instances, the state abbreviation is used, while in others, the full state name is provided. This column highlights the wide geographic distribution of these institutions, covering both coasts, the Midwest, and southern regions of the United States.

### Output Column Summary:

The output data standardizes the information provided in the second input column, focusing on the geographical locations of the institutions. It ensures consistency in the format by including the city, state abbreviation, and the country ("USA") for each entry. This standardization process involves correcting misspellings (e.g., "Phialdelphia" to "Philadelphia"), abbreviating state names consistently, and adding "USA" to entries where it was missing, ensuring uniformity across all entries. The output reflects a structured and concise representation of the locations, making it easier to understand and compare the geographical distribution of these institutions.

### Relationship Summary:

The relationship between the input and output columns is a process of standardization and correction of the geographical location data associated with various higher education institutions in the United States. The transformation involves:

1. Correcting typographical errors in city names.
2. Standardizing state names to their two-letter abbreviations.
3. Ensuring the inclusion of "USA" in all entries to denote the country consistently.

This process enhances the clarity and uniformity of the location data, facilitating easier comparison and analysis of the geographical spread of these institutions. It underscores the importance of data standardization, especially when dealing with qualitative information that may initially be presented in various formats., and input as ['University of Pennsylvania', 'Phialdelphia, PA, USA'] output is Phialdelphia, PA, USA, input as ['UCLA', 'Los Angeles, CA'] output is Los Angeles, CA, USA, input as ['Cornell University', 'Ithaca, New York, USA'] output is Ithaca, NY, USA, input as ['Penn', 'Philadelphia, PA, USA'] output is Philadelphia, PA, USA, input as ['University of Maryland College Park', 'College Park, MD'] output is College Park, MD, USA, input as ['University of Michigan', 'Ann Arbor, MI, USA'] output is Ann Arbor, MI, USA, input as ['UC Berkeley', 'Berkeley, CA'] output is Berkeley, CA, USA, input as ['MIT', 'Cambridge, MA'] output is Cambridge, MA, USA, input as ['Rice University', 'Houston, TX'] output is Houston, TX, USA, input as ['Yale University', 'New Haven, CT, USA'] output is New Haven, CT, USA, input as ['Columbia University', 'New York, NY, USA'] output is New York, NY, USA, input as ['NYU', 'New York, New York, USA'] output is New York, NY, USA, input as ['UC Berkeley', 'Berkeley, CA'] output is Berkeley, CA, USA, input as ['UIUC', 'Urbana, IL'] output is Urbana, IL, USA, input as ['Temple University', 'Philadelphia, PA'] output is Philadelphia, PA, USA, input as ['Harvard University', 'Cambridge, MA, USA'] output is Cambridge, MA, USA, input as ['University of Connecticut', 'Storrs, CT, USA'] output is Storrs, CT, USA, input as ['Drexel University', 'Philadelphia, PA'] output is Philadelphia, PA, USA, input as ['New Haven University', 'New Haven, CT, USA'] output is New Haven, CT, USA, input as ['University of California, Santa Barbara', 'Santa Barbara, CA, USA'] output is Santa Barbara, CA, USA, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
