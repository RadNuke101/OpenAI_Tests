Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Input Column Summary:

The input data consists of a series of strings that represent phone numbers in an international format. Each string begins with a '+' sign, followed by a country code of one to three digits, a space, and then a local number divided into three groups by hyphens. The first group after the country code contains three digits, followed by two groups of three digits each. The format for all inputs is consistent, following the pattern '+[country code] [XXX-XXX-XXX]'. The country codes vary in length, indicating different countries or regions. The local numbers follow a uniform pattern but vary in the actual digits, suggesting a wide range of phone numbers across different areas within the specified countries.

### Output Column Summary:

The output data transforms the format of the input phone numbers into a slightly different presentation while retaining all original information. The transformation involves the placement of the first group of three digits (following the country code) within parentheses and removing the space that originally followed the country code. The rest of the number remains unchanged, maintaining the division into two groups of three digits each, separated by hyphens. The output format is '+[country code] ([XXX]) XXX-XXX', which is a common way to represent phone numbers, emphasizing the area code (the first group of three digits) by enclosing it in parentheses. This format is consistent across all outputs, indicating a standardized approach to formatting phone numbers for readability and possibly aligning with certain stylistic or regional preferences for displaying phone numbers.

### Relationship Summary:

The transformation from the input to the output column represents a standardization process for phone number formatting. The key change involves the visual grouping of the area code (the first three digits following the country code) by enclosing it in parentheses and eliminating the space between the country code and the area code. This adjustment does not alter the essential information contained within each phone number but rather restructures it for enhanced clarity and possibly to conform to specific formatting preferences. The consistency in both input and output formats suggests a systematic approach to handling phone number data, aimed at maintaining all original numerical information while improving the presentation and readability of the numbers across different contexts., and input as ['+106 769-858-438'] output is +106 (769) 858-438, input as ['+83 973-757-831'] output is +83 (973) 757-831, input as ['+62 647-787-775'] output is +62 (647) 787-775, input as ['+172 027-507-632'] output is +172 (027) 507-632, input as ['+72 001-050-856'] output is +72 (001) 050-856, input as ['+95 310-537-401'] output is +95 (310) 537-401, input as ['+6 775-969-238'] output is +6 (775) 969-238, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
