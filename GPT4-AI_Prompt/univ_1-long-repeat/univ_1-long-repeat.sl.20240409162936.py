Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Input Column Summary:

The input data consists of two columns, each containing strings. The first column lists the names of various educational institutions, including universities and colleges, primarily located in the United States. These names range from well-known public and private universities (e.g., "UC Berkeley," "University of Pennsylvania," "MIT") to more specific institutions (e.g., "NYU," "UIUC"). The second column provides the geographical location of these institutions, specifying the city and state, and in some cases, the country (e.g., "Berkeley, CA," "Philadelphia, PA, USA," "Cambridge, MA"). The locations are detailed enough to identify the institution's setting within a broader geographical context, including city, state, and occasionally the country if it's the USA. This combination of institution names and locations offers a comprehensive view of a variety of higher education settings across different regions.

### Output Column Summary:

The output data combines the information from the two input columns into a single string for each entry, formatted as "Institution Name, Location." This format maintains the original information while presenting it in a more concise and connected manner. The output strings are consistent in their structure, ensuring that the name of the educational institution is immediately followed by its geographical location, separated by a comma. This format is useful for quickly identifying both the name of the institution and its location in one glance, making the data easily accessible for reference or analysis purposes.

### Relationship Summary:

The relationship between the input and output columns is a transformation of data presentation from a separated to a combined format. The input data, initially divided into two distinct columns for names and locations, is merged into a single output string that succinctly encapsulates both pieces of information. This transformation enhances the readability and usability of the data by providing a direct association between each institution and its geographical context without altering the original information. The process effectively streamlines the data for applications where quick identification of both the institution and its location is beneficial, such as in directories, academic research, or geographical analyses of educational institutions., and input as ['UC Berkeley', 'Berkeley, CA'] output is UC Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, input as ['University of Pennsylvania', 'Phialdelphia, PA, USA'] output is University of Pennsylvania, Phialdelphia, PA, USA, input as ['UCLA', 'Los Angeles, CA'] output is UCLA, Los Angeles, CA, input as ['Cornell University', 'Ithaca, New York, USA'] output is Cornell University, Ithaca, New York, USA, input as ['Penn', 'Philadelphia, PA, USA'] output is Penn, Philadelphia, PA, USA, input as ['University of Michigan', 'Ann Arbor, MI, USA'] output is University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA, input as ['UC Berkeley', 'Berkeley, CA'] output is UC Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, input as ['MIT', 'Cambridge, MA'] output is MIT, Cambridge, MA, input as ['University of Pennsylvania', 'Phialdelphia, PA, USA'] output is University of Pennsylvania, Phialdelphia, PA, USA, input as ['UCLA', 'Los Angeles, CA'] output is UCLA, Los Angeles, CA, input as ['University of Maryland College Park', 'College Park, MD'] output is University of Maryland College Park, College Park, MD, input as ['University of Michigan', 'Ann Arbor, MI, USA'] output is University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA, input as ['UC Berkeley', 'Berkeley, CA'] output is UC Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, input as ['MIT', 'Cambridge, MA'] output is MIT, Cambridge, MA, input as ['Rice University', 'Houston, TX'] output is Rice University, Houston, TX, input as ['Yale University', 'New Haven, CT, USA'] output is Yale University, New Haven, CT, USA, input as ['Columbia University', 'New York, NY, USA'] output is Columbia University, New York, NY, USA, input as ['NYU', 'New York, New York, USA'] output is NYU, New York, New York, USA, input as ['Drexel University', 'Philadelphia, PA'] output is Drexel University, Philadelphia, PA, input as ['UC Berkeley', 'Berkeley, CA'] output is UC Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, input as ['UIUC', 'Urbana, IL'] output is UIUC, Urbana, IL, input as ['Temple University', 'Philadelphia, PA'] output is Temple University, Philadelphia, PA, input as ['Harvard University', 'Cambridge, MA, USA'] output is Harvard University, Cambridge, MA, USA, input as ['University of Connecticut', 'Storrs, CT, USA'] output is University of Connecticut, Storrs, CT, USA, input as ['Drexel University', 'Philadelphia, PA'] output is Drexel University, Philadelphia, PA, input as ['NYU', 'New York, New York, USA'] output is NYU, New York, New York, USA, input as ['UIUC', 'Urbana, IL'] output is UIUC, Urbana, IL, input as ['New Haven University', 'New Haven, CT, USA'] output is New Haven University, New Haven, CT, USA, input as ['University of California, Santa Barbara', 'Santa Barbara, CA, USA'] output is University of California, Santa Barbara, Santa Barbara, CA, USA, input as ['University of Connecticut', 'Storrs, CT, USA'] output is University of Connecticut, Storrs, CT, USA, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
