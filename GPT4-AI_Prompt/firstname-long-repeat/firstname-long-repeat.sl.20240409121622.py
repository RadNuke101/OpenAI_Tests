Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Input Column Summary:

The input data consists of a list of full names, each presented as a single string within a list. These names are diverse, representing a wide range of backgrounds, indicated by the variety of first and last names. Each entry is structured with the first name followed by the last name, and there are no middle names included. The names are of individuals, likely representing a sample from a larger population. The repetition of certain names suggests either a commonality in name selection or a smaller subset of individuals being referenced multiple times.

### Output Column Summary:

The output data extracts and presents the first name from each full name provided in the input data. This process of extraction indicates a focus on personal identification on a first-name basis, simplifying the data from a full name to a more casual, first-name-only basis. The output retains the diversity of the input, showcasing a wide range of first names that correspond to the varied backgrounds implied by the full names. The repetition of certain first names in the output mirrors the input, reinforcing the notion of either common name preferences or a specific focus on a subset of individuals.

### Relationship Summary:

The relationship between the input and output data is a systematic extraction of the first name from a full name. This process simplifies the identification of individuals by focusing solely on their first names, removing the specificity and additional identity layer provided by last names. The transformation from full names to first names suggests a purpose or context where personal, informal identification is preferred or sufficient. This could be indicative of a setting or application where the familiarity of first names is more appropriate or where the emphasis is on individual personal identity rather than formal identification. The consistency in this extraction process across the diverse dataset highlights a uniform method of simplifying or personalizing data for use in scenarios where less formal identification is required or desired., and input as ['Nancy FreeHafer'] output is Nancy, input as ['Andrew Cencici'] output is Andrew, input as ['Jan Kotas'] output is Jan, input as ['Mariya Sergienko'] output is Mariya, input

above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
