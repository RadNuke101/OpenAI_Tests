Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Input Column Summary:

The input data consists of two columns, each containing strings that represent items, primarily watches, identified by specific model codes. The first column includes a descriptive name followed by a model code (e.g., "Item 1 AQ-S810W-2AVDF"), indicating a more detailed identification, including the model series and specific variant. The second column presents a truncated or partial version of the model code found in the first column (e.g., "AQ-S810W-2AVDF"), typically omitting the descriptive name and sometimes providing a less detailed version of the model code.

### Output Column Summary:

The output data is a single column that appears to extract and transform elements from the input columns, focusing on the descriptive name and specific variant details of the model code. The transformation rules seem to vary: in some cases, the output retains the descriptive name and omits the model code entirely if the second input column fully matches part of the model code in the first column. In other cases, where the second input column provides a less detailed model code, the output retains the descriptive name and appends any additional variant details from the first column that are not captured by the second column.

### Relationship Summary:

The relationship between the input and output columns is characterized by a process of extraction and condensation of information, aiming to highlight specific details about the items while removing redundant or fully matched model codes. The process appears to follow these rules:

1. **Descriptive Name Retention**: The descriptive name (e.g., "Item 1", "Item 2") is always retained in the output, indicating its importance in identifying the item regardless of the model code details.

2. **Model Code Matching and Omission**: If the second input column's model code fully matches a segment of the model code in the first column, the model code is omitted from the output, suggesting a redundancy reduction strategy.

3. **Variant Detail Extraction**: When the second input column provides a less detailed model code than the first, any additional variant details from the first column not present in the second are appended to the output. This indicates an effort to preserve specific variant information that might be relevant for identification or differentiation purposes.

In summary, the transformation from input to output seeks to streamline the item identification process by retaining essential descriptive names, reducing redundancy in model code representation, and highlighting variant details that might be lost in a less detailed model code. This process facilitates a more efficient and focused representation of the items, potentially aiding in inventory management, cataloging, or identification tasks where concise yet descriptive item representations are beneficial., and input as ['Item 1 AQ-S810W-2AVDF', 'AQ-S810W-2AVDF'] output is Item 1, input as ['Item 2 AQ-230A-1DUQ', 'AQ-230A'] output is Item 2 -1DUQ, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
