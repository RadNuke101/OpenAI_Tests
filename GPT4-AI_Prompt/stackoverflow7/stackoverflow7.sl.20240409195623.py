Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Input Column Summary:

The input data consists of two columns, each containing strings that represent items and their model numbers. The first column typically includes a descriptive name followed by a model number (e.g., "Item 1 AQ-S810W-2AVDF"), while the second column contains only the model number or a part of it (e.g., "AQ-S810W-2AVDF"). The model numbers in the second column sometimes are complete and match part of the model number in the first column, or they may represent a truncated version of the model number found in the first column. The items mentioned in the examples, such as "Item 1" and "Item 2", suggest a sequence or a list of items, possibly indicating a catalog or inventory context. The model numbers follow a specific format, likely indicating a type of product, brand, or manufacturer's coding system.

### Output Column Summary:

The output data consists of strings that appear to represent a simplified or modified version of the first column from the input data. The transformation process seems to involve the comparison and manipulation of the model numbers between the two input columns. When the model number in the second column matches or is contained within the model number in the first column, the output retains the descriptive name ("Item 1", "Item 2", etc.) and, in cases where the model number in the first column contains additional information not present in the second column, this additional information is appended to the descriptive name in the output (e.g., "-1DUQ"). This suggests that the output is a condensed form of the first input column, emphasizing the descriptive name while also highlighting any specific differences or additional details found in the model numbers.

### Relationship Summary:

The relationship between the input and output columns is characterized by a process of extraction and condensation. The output is derived by analyzing the model numbers in both input columns, identifying the base item description from the first column, and then appending any additional, unique identifiers from the model number that were not included in the second column. This process effectively creates a concise identifier for each item that retains the essential descriptive name while also incorporating any specific or unique model number details that differentiate similar items. The transformation appears to be designed to simplify inventory tracking, cataloging, or identification tasks by providing a streamlined, yet informative, representation of each item., and input as ['Item 1 AQ-S810W-2AVDF', 'AQ-S810W-2AVDF'] output is Item 1, input as ['Item 2 AQ-230A-1DUQ', 'AQ-230A'] output is Item 2 -1DUQ, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
