Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Summary for Input Column Data:

The input data consists of strings representing phone numbers in a specific format. Each string is structured with digits grouped in a pattern separated by hyphens. The pattern follows the format: NXX-NXX-XXXX, where 'N' represents digits from 2 to 9 and 'X' represents any digit from 0 to 9. This format is commonly used in the United States and Canada for formatting telephone numbers. The input data is qualitative, representing a standardized way of writing phone numbers rather than numerical values to be calculated or analyzed quantitatively.

### Summary for Output Column Data:

The output data transforms the input strings into a continuous string of digits, removing the hyphens that separate the groups of numbers in the input. The output retains the sequence of digits from the input but presents them in a compact form. This transformation results in a string of 10 consecutive digits for each phone number, following the pattern: NXXNXXXXXX. The output data, like the input, is qualitative, representing phone numbers in a different format. The transformation does not alter the numerical value or the order of the digits; it merely changes the presentation format.

### Relationship Between Input and Output:

The relationship between the input and output data is a straightforward transformation process that involves the removal of hyphens from the input phone numbers to produce a continuous string of digits. This process does not alter the sequence or the value of the digits; it simply changes the format from a hyphen-separated string to a continuous digit string. The transformation can be seen as a formatting change that might be used for purposes such as standardizing data entry, facilitating the storage of phone numbers in databases, or preparing data for systems that require a specific format for processing. The essence of the phone number remains unchanged; only its presentation is altered., and input as ['801-345-1987'] output is 8013451987, input as ['612-554-2000'] output is 6125542000, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
