Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Input Column Summary

The input data consists of a single column containing strings that represent phone numbers in a specific format. Each entry in this column follows a pattern where the phone number is divided into three groups by hyphens: the first group consists of three digits, the second group also consists of three digits, and the third group consists of four digits. This format can be summarized as `XXX-XXX-XXXX`, where `X` represents a digit from 0 to 9. The data is qualitative, representing phone numbers as a form of categorical data, even though the content is numerical. Each entry is unique and serves as an identifier or contact information.

### Output Column Summary

The output data is derived directly from the input column, with the transformation being the removal of hyphens from the phone numbers. The resulting output is a continuous string of digits without any separators, following the pattern `XXXXXXXXXX`, where `X` represents a digit. This transformation does not alter the qualitative nature of the data; it merely changes its format. The output retains the uniqueness and identifying characteristics of each phone number, making it directly comparable to the input data, albeit in a slightly different format.

### Relationship Between Input and Output

The relationship between the input and output columns is a straightforward transformation process that involves the removal of hyphens from the input phone numbers to produce a continuous string of digits. This process does not involve any change in the order of digits, addition, or subtraction of information, but merely a reformatting of the data presentation. The transformation is consistent across the dataset, applying the same rule to every entry without exception. This process can be seen as a form of data cleaning or standardization, where the goal is to achieve a uniform format for all phone numbers in the dataset, potentially making it easier to store, compare, or process the data for further analysis or use in applications where a specific format is required., and input as ['801-345-1987'] output is 8013451987, input as ['612-554-2000'] output is 6125542000, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
