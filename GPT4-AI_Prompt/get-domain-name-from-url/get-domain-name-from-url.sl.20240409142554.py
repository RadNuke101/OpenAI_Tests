Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Summary of Input Column Data:

The input data consists of URLs in a string format, each representing a full path to a specific page or resource on a website. These URLs follow a standard structure, starting with the protocol (either "https" or "http"), followed by "://", then the domain name (which can include subdomains like "www"), and finally the path to the specific resource or page after the domain name, separated by slashes ("/"). The paths in the given examples vary in length and structure, indicating different levels of navigation within the website (e.g., "/def", "/def/cef", "/wp/def-def"). The input data showcases a variety of website addresses, each leading to a specific content piece or page rather than the homepage.

### Summary of Output Column Data:

The output data simplifies the input URLs by truncating them to their base form, essentially stripping them down to the protocol and the domain name, and removing the path to the specific resource or page. The output retains the protocol part ("https" or "http") and the domain name (including any subdomains like "www"), but it ends right after the domain name, effectively pointing to the homepage of the website rather than any specific content within it. The output format is consistent across examples, showcasing a standardization process that extracts the root or base URL from a more complex input URL.

### Relationship Summary:

The transformation from the input to the output data represents a process of simplification and standardization of URLs. The key operation in this process is the removal of the specific path to content within the website, leaving only the protocol and the domain name. This operation suggests a focus on identifying the source website of the content rather than the content itself. The relationship between the input and output data highlights a method for extracting the base URL from a more detailed URL, which could be useful for tasks that require identifying or categorizing websites based on their domain names without regard to the specific pages or resources within those sites. This transformation effectively generalizes the input data, making it easier to understand the origin of the content without the details of the specific location within the site., and input as ['https=//abc.com/def'] output is https=//abc.com/, input as ['http=//www.abc.com/def/cef'] output is http=//www.abc.com, input as ['http=//chandoo.org/wp/def-def'] output is http=//chandoo.org/, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
