Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Summary of Input Column Data:

The input column consists of strings that represent URLs. These URLs are characterized by the following features:
- They start with either "https://" or "http://", although in the provided examples, the colon (:) is replaced with an equal sign (=), which is not standard for URLs.
- They include a domain name, which can vary from general domains like "abc.com" to more specific ones like "chandoo.org".
- Following the domain name, there is a path that starts with a forward slash (/) and includes one or more segments separated by slashes, indicating a deeper level of resource or page within the website (e.g., "/def", "/def/cef", "/wp/def-def").

The input data represents full URLs pointing to specific pages or resources within a website.

### Summary of Output Column Data:

The output column contains strings that represent the base URLs extracted from the corresponding input URLs. The characteristics of these output URLs include:
- They maintain the initial protocol part ("https://" or "http://") with the colon replaced by an equal sign, consistent with the input format.
- The domain name is preserved exactly as it appears in the input.
- The path component is either completely removed, leaving just the base URL of the domain (e.g., "http=//www.abc.com"), or it is truncated to a single slash ("/"), indicating the root of the website without pointing to any specific resource or page (e.g., "https=//abc.com/").

The output data simplifies the input URLs to their base forms, either by stripping away the path entirely or reducing it to indicate the root of the website.

### Relationship Summary:

The transformation from the input to the output column involves a process of simplification and standardization of URLs. The key steps in this transformation include:
- Retaining the protocol and domain name without alteration, except for the unconventional replacement of the colon in the protocol.
- Removing or truncating the path component of the URL to either leave the base domain URL or indicate the root of the website with a single slash.

This process effectively extracts the base URL from a more specific URL, focusing on the domain and protocol while discarding the specific page or resource path. This transformation is useful for tasks that require understanding or categorizing websites at the domain level rather than at the level of individual pages or resources., and input as ['https=//abc.com/def'] output is https=//abc.com/, input as ['http=//www.abc.com/def/cef'] output is http=//www.abc.com, input as ['http=//chandoo.org/wp/def-def'] output is http=//chandoo.org/, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
