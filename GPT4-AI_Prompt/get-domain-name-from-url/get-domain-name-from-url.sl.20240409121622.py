Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Input Column Summary:

The input data consists of URLs in a string format, each representing a full path to a specific page or resource on a website. These URLs are characterized by a protocol identifier (either 'https' or 'http'), followed by '://', then the domain name, and finally the specific path to the resource within the website, which could include subdirectories and file names. The URLs in the input data vary in terms of the domain names (e.g., 'abc.com', 'www.abc.com', 'chandoo.org') and the specificity of the path, ranging from a single directory ('/def') to multiple directories ('/def/cef', '/wp/def-def'). The input data represents a diverse set of web resources, indicating a variety of domains and path depths.

### Output Column Summary:

The output data retains the protocol identifier and the domain name from the input URLs but omits the specific path to the resource, effectively truncating the URL to its base form. This transformation results in a simplified version of each URL, focusing on the root of the website without specifying any particular page or resource. The output URLs end either right after the domain name or include a trailing slash ('/'), indicating the root of the website. The transformation applied from input to output consistently removes the path component of the URL across different domains and path complexities.

### Relationship Summary:

The transformation from the input to the output data demonstrates a process of URL simplification, where the specific paths to resources within a website are removed, leaving only the protocol identifier and the domain name. This process can be seen as a way to generalize or abstract the original URLs, focusing on the website's root rather than any specific content. The relationship between the input and output data highlights a consistent method of truncating URLs to their base forms, irrespective of the original path complexity or the domain name. This simplification could be useful for tasks that require understanding or analyzing the domain level of web resources without needing the specificity of individual pages or files., and input as ['https=//abc.com/def'] output is https=//abc.com/, input as ['http=//www.abc.com/def/cef'] output is http=//www.abc.com, input as ['http=//chandoo.org/wp/def-def'] output is http=//chandoo.org/, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
