Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Summary of Input Column Data:

The input data consists of strings that represent URLs. These URLs are characterized by a protocol (either `https` or `http`), followed by `=//`, a domain name (which may include subdomains like `www`), and a path that follows the domain name, indicated by `/` and subsequent directory or file names. The URLs provided in the input data vary in structure, specifically in the domain and path portions. The protocols are modified with an equal sign (`=`) instead of the usual colon (`:`) seen in standard URLs. The paths include various levels of directories and sometimes file names, indicating specific resources or pages within the website.

### Summary of Output Column Data:

The output data retains the protocol and domain name from the input URLs but omits the path, effectively truncating the URL to its base form. This base form includes the protocol (with the equal sign modification), the domain (including any subdomains), and a trailing slash in some cases, indicating the root of the website without specifying any particular resource or page. The transformation from input to output systematically removes the specific path, leaving only the protocol and domain name, which identifies the website in its most general form.

### Relationship Summary:

The relationship between the input and output data demonstrates a process of simplification or generalization of URLs. The transformation retains the essential components of the URL that identify the website's domain but removes the more specific components that direct to particular resources or pages within that domain. This process could be seen as extracting the base URL or the root domain from a more detailed URL. The modification of the protocol (using `=` instead of `:`) is consistently preserved in both input and output, indicating that the transformation focuses on the structure of the URL rather than correcting any deviations from standard URL formatting. The purpose of this transformation could be to facilitate operations or analyses that require only the domain information of a URL, such as categorizing or grouping data by website, without the need for the specificity of individual pages or resources., and input as ['https=//abc.com/def'] output is https=//abc.com/, input as ['http=//www.abc.com/def/cef'] output is http=//www.abc.com, input as ['http=//chandoo.org/wp/def-def'] output is http=//chandoo.org/, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
