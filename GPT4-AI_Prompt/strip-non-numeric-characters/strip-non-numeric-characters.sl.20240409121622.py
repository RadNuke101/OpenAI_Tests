Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Input Column Summary:

The input data consists of strings that contain a mix of textual information and numerical values. These strings are structured in various formats, often including descriptive text alongside the numbers. The numbers within these strings are of primary interest and are presented in different contexts, such as quantities (e.g., "100 apples"), prices (e.g., "%500 dollars"), or identifiers (e.g., "serial number %003399"). The presence of symbols like "%" and textual descriptions (e.g., "the price is", "serial number") indicate that the numerical values are embedded within a broader narrative or descriptive framework. The input data is qualitative, with the numbers being an integral part of the narrative rather than standalone quantitative values.

### Output Column Summary:

The output data extracts and isolates the numerical values from the input strings, presenting them as standalone figures. These numbers are represented in the format they appear in the input, including leading zeros where applicable (e.g., "003399"). The output focuses solely on the numerical aspect of the input, disregarding any textual context or descriptive elements that accompany these numbers in the input data. This process transforms the qualitative nature of the input data into a more quantitative format, emphasizing the numerical values over the narrative or descriptive content.

### Relationship Summary:

The relationship between the input and output data is characterized by a process of extraction and emphasis on numerical values. The input data's qualitative nature, with numbers embedded within textual or descriptive contexts, is transformed into a quantitative output that highlights these numbers in isolation. This transformation involves identifying and extracting the numerical values from their surrounding text, effectively stripping away the qualitative elements to focus solely on the numbers themselves. The output serves as a distilled representation of the input, where the numbers are freed from their narrative context and presented as pure data. This process underscores the importance of the numerical values within the input data, elevating them from being parts of a narrative to being the central focus in the output., and input as ['100 apples'] output is 100, input as ['the price is %500 dollars'] output is 500, input as ['serial number %003399'] output is 003399, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
