Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Input Column Summary:

The input column consists of strings that contain a mix of textual descriptions and numerical values. These strings are diverse in their formats, including descriptions of quantities (e.g., '100 apples'), prices (e.g., 'the price is %500 dollars'), and identifiers (e.g., 'serial number %003399'). The numerical values are embedded within a context that provides additional information about what the number represents, such as a quantity of items, a price in dollars, or a serial number. The presence of symbols like '%' and the use of words to indicate units ('dollars', 'apples') or categories ('serial number') are notable. The input data is qualitative, with the numbers being part of a broader narrative or description rather than standalone quantitative data.

### Output Column Summary:

The output column consists solely of the numerical values extracted from the input strings. These outputs are presented as strings but represent the numerical part of the input without the contextual descriptions or units. The extraction process retains the formatting of the numbers, including leading zeros (e.g., '003399') and does not convert the numbers into a different format or unit. The output data is more uniform than the input, focusing exclusively on the numeric aspect of the input data.

### Relationship Summary:

The relationship between the input and output columns is characterized by the extraction and isolation of numerical values from a broader textual context. The process involves identifying and separating the numbers from the surrounding text, which may include descriptive text, units of measurement, and symbols. This relationship highlights a transformation from qualitative to quasi-quantitative data, where the numbers are taken out of their original context and presented in isolation. The key operation is the identification and extraction of numeric sequences from a mixed data format, preserving the original formatting of the numbers but removing the qualitative descriptors that provide context in the input data. This transformation allows for a focus on the numeric information while discarding the textual descriptions that are not relevant to the desired output., and input as ['100 apples'] output is 100, input as ['the price is %500 dollars'] output is 500, input as ['serial number %003399'] output is 003399, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
