Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Input Column Summary:

The input data consists of strings that contain a mixture of text and numerical values. These strings appear to follow a pattern where the numerical value is embedded within a context that provides some information about what the number represents (e.g., quantity of items, price, serial number). The format of the numerical value within the strings varies, including plain numbers, numbers prefixed with a percentage sign, and numbers with leading zeros. The textual content surrounding the numbers serves as a descriptor, indicating the nature or category of the number (e.g., apples indicating quantity, dollars indicating currency, serial number indicating an identifier).

### Output Column Summary:

The output data extracts and isolates the numerical values from the input strings, presenting them in a raw numeric format. The transformation from input to output involves stripping away all textual content and any special characters (e.g., percentage signs) that are not part of the numerical value itself. The output retains the formatting of the numbers as they appear in the input, including leading zeros where present. This suggests that the process preserves the numerical integrity and formatting of the input data, focusing solely on extracting the numeric component.

### Relationship Summary:

The relationship between the input and output columns is characterized by a data extraction and transformation process. The primary operation involves identifying, isolating, and extracting numerical values from a mixed-format input string. This process disregards the textual context and any non-numeric characters, focusing on capturing the numeric value in its original format. The transformation is consistent across different types of numerical representations within the input, whether they are plain numbers, prefixed with symbols, or include leading zeros.

The input data's qualitative nature, with its contextual descriptions and varied formats, contrasts with the output data's quantitative focus, emphasizing the numeric values devoid of context. The relationship underscores a filtering mechanism that bridges the qualitative and quantitative realms, translating descriptive, contextually rich information into pure numeric data. This transformation facilitates a shift from a descriptive to a quantitative analysis perspective, enabling further numeric-based processing or analysis while retaining the original numeric formatting for accuracy and fidelity to the source data., and input as ['100 apples'] output is 100, input as ['the price is %500 dollars'] output is 500, input as ['serial number %003399'] output is 003399, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
