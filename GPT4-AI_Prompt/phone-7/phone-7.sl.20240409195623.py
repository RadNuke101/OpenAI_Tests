Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Summary of Input Column Data

The input data consists of strings formatted as phone numbers with a specific structure. Each string begins with a country code prefixed by a plus sign ('+'), followed by a space, and then a sequence of digits separated into three groups by hyphens ('-'). The first group after the country code varies in length, possibly depending on the country code or other factors not explicitly stated. The second and third groups of digits are consistent in their separation by hyphens. The data does not directly indicate the significance of each group of digits (e.g., area code, local number, etc.), but it follows a recognizable pattern of international phone number formatting.

### Summary of Output Column Data

The output data consists of integers extracted from the input strings. Specifically, these integers are the second group of digits in the input strings, situated between the first and second hyphens. The output retains the leading zeros where present, indicating that the data is treated as a sequence of digits or a code rather than a numerical value. This suggests that the output is not meant for arithmetic operations but rather for identification or categorization purposes.

### Relationship Between Input and Output

The relationship between the input and output data is straightforward: the output is derived directly from the input by extracting a specific portion of the input string. This portion is the second group of digits in the formatted phone number, which could represent a specific segment of the phone number such as an area code or another identifier within the phone number's structure. The extraction process ignores the country code and the first and third groups of digits, focusing solely on the middle segment. This consistent extraction pattern suggests a possible significance or utility of the middle segment across different phone numbers, regardless of their country of origin or the total length of the number. The process treats the data qualitatively, focusing on the structure and composition of the strings rather than interpreting the numbers quantitatively., and input as ['+106 769-858-438'] output is 858, input as ['+83 973-757-831'] output is 757, input as ['+62 647-787-775'] output is 787, input as ['+172 027-507-632'] output is 507, input as ['+72 001-050-856'] output is 050, input as ['+95 310-537-401'] output is 537, input as ['+6 775-969-238'] output is 969, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
