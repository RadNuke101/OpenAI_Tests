Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: To generate a summary that describes the relationship between the input and output data, let's first examine the structure of the input and the corresponding output:

### Input Structure:
The input data consists of strings formatted in a specific pattern:
- A prefix that starts with a plus sign (+) followed by a variable number of digits (country code).
- A space.
- A sequence of three groups of digits separated by hyphens (`-`). These groups appear to represent a phone number in a format similar to `XXX-XXX-XXX`.

### Output Structure:
The output data consists of the middle group of digits from the phone number part of the input string.

### Relationship Summary:
1. **Country Code Irrelevance**: The prefix (country code) in the input data, despite varying in length and value, does not influence the output. This indicates that the output is independent of the country code.

2. **Extraction of Middle Group**: The output consistently represents the middle group of digits from the phone number portion of the input data. This suggests a rule or function that extracts this specific part of the input string, ignoring the first and last groups of digits as well as the country code.

3. **Preservation of Leading Zeros**: In cases where the middle group of digits starts with one or more zeros (e.g., `050`), these leading zeros are preserved in the output. This indicates that the output treats the extracted data as a string or qualitative data rather than converting it into a numerical format where leading zeros would be dropped.

4. **Uniformity Across Varied Inputs**: Despite variations in the country code and the specific digits of the phone numbers, the method of deriving the output remains consistent across all inputs. This uniformity suggests a standardized process or rule applied to all input data to generate the output.

### Summary for Output Column:
The output data column consists of a series of three-digit groups extracted from a larger string. These groups are treated as qualitative data, maintaining any leading zeros, and are consistently derived from the middle portion of a three-part phone number sequence in the input data. The output is independent of other parts of the input string, such as the country code or the other groups of digits in the phone number.

### Conclusion:
The relationship between the input and output data is defined by a specific extraction process that focuses solely on the middle group of digits from the phone number part of the input, treating this group as a qualitative entity. This process is applied uniformly across all inputs, regardless of variations in other components of the input data., and input as ['+106 769-858-438'] output is 858, input as ['+83 973-757-831'] output is 757, input as ['+62 647-787-775'] output is 787, input as ['+172 027-507-632'] output is 507, input as ['+72 001-050-856'] output is 050, input as ['+95 310-537-401'] output is 537, input as ['+6 775-969-238'] output is 969, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
