Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Summary of Input Column Data

The input data consists of strings formatted as international phone numbers. Each string begins with a country code prefixed with a plus sign, followed by a space, and then a sequence of digits separated into three groups by hyphens. The format can be summarized as `+CC XXX-XXX-XXX`, where `CC` represents the country code, which varies in length, and the `X`s represent the phone number digits, grouped in a specific pattern. The input data shows variability in the length of the country codes, ranging from one to three digits, and the phone numbers follow a consistent pattern of three groups of digits.

### Summary of Output Column Data

The output data consists of three-digit numbers extracted from the input strings. Specifically, these numbers represent the second group of digits from the phone number portion of the input strings. The output numbers range from 050 to 969, indicating a wide range of values without any apparent numerical pattern relating to the input's country code or other parts of the phone number.

### Relationship Between Input and Output

The relationship between the input and output data is based on the extraction of a specific part of the phone number from the input string. Regardless of the country code or the first and third groups of digits in the phone number, the output consistently corresponds to the second group of digits in the phone number sequence. This indicates a pattern where the output is determined by a positional rule within the structured format of the input data, rather than any numerical or qualitative characteristics of the data itself. The process to obtain the output from the input involves isolating the middle segment of the phone number, demonstrating a clear and consistent method of extraction across all given examples., and input as ['+106 769-858-438'] output is 858, input as ['+83 973-757-831'] output is 757, input as ['+62 647-787-775'] output is 787, input as ['+172 027-507-632'] output is 507, input as ['+72 001-050-856'] output is 050, input as ['+95 310-537-401'] output is 537, input as ['+6 775-969-238'] output is 969, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
