Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Summary for Input Column Data:

The input data consists of two columns, with each row containing a pair of strings. The first string in each pair appears to be a name, composed of what seems to be a first name and a last name, separated by a space. These names are diverse, suggesting no specific pattern or limitation regarding culture or origin. The second string in each pair is structured like an email address but lacks the conventional format. Instead of the usual "@" symbol, an underscore "_" is used to separate what would typically be the username from the domain. The part before the underscore varies and sometimes seems to reference the name in the first string, either partially or in a modified form. The part after the underscore represents a domain, which does not necessarily have any apparent connection to the name in the first string.

### Summary for Output Column Data:

The output data extracted from the second string of each input pair is the domain part of what resembles an email address. These domains are diverse in structure, including various top-level domains (TLDs) and sometimes additional subdomains. The output consistently excludes the part of the string before the underscore, focusing solely on the domain. This suggests a process of isolating a specific component from a more complex string, potentially for the purpose of identifying or categorizing the data based on the domain information.

### Relationship Summary:

The relationship between the input and output data involves a transformation process where the input data, specifically the second string of each pair that resembles an unconventional email address, is parsed to extract the domain part of the string. This process disregards the name and the initial part of the string before the underscore, focusing on isolating the domain for output. The transformation suggests a method of data cleaning or preparation, where the domain information is of primary interest, possibly for tasks such as domain analysis, categorization, or for further processing that requires only the domain part of an email-like string. The names in the first string of each pair do not directly influence the output but may serve as contextual information or for validation purposes in a broader data processing task., and input as ['ann chang', 'achang_maaker.com'] output is maaker.com, input as ['bobby smith', 'bobt_sphynx.uk.co'] output is sphynx.uk.co, input as ['art lennox', 'art.lennox_svxn.com'] output is svxn.com, input as ['smith bagshaw', 'smith_bbbbb.com'] output is bbbbb.com, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
