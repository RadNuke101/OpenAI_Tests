Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Input Column Summary:

The input data consists of two distinct parts for each entry. The first part is a name, which appears to be in a 'first name last name' format, representing an individual's full name. These names vary widely, with no apparent pattern in terms of ethnicity, length, or composition. The second part of each entry is an email-like string, which does not follow standard email format conventions. Instead, it seems to be a combination of a username, an underscore, and a domain-like structure. The username part often appears to be a derivative or abbreviation of the individual's name, though the method of derivation varies (e.g., shortening, concatenation of initials, or using parts of the name). The domain-like structure after the underscore does not resemble typical domain names and seems to be a unique identifier or keyword related to each individual.

### Output Column Summary:

The output data for each entry is a simplified domain-like string, which appears to be extracted from the latter part of the second input component (the part after the underscore in the email-like string). These outputs retain the structure of a domain but do not correspond to real-world, recognizable domains. They are simplified to what seems to be a core identifier or keyword, followed by a top-level domain (TLD) suffix (e.g., .com, .uk.co). The relationship between the input and output suggests a process of extracting and simplifying the unique identifier from the second part of the input, focusing on the portion that follows the underscore character.

### Relationship Summary:

The transformation from input to output involves a selective extraction process focused on the second part of the input data. Specifically, the operation isolates the portion of the string that comes after the underscore character in the email-like strings, effectively discarding the username part and any standard email format conventions. This process reveals a simplified, domain-like structure that seems to serve as a unique identifier or keyword for each entry. The relationship between the input and output underscores a method of distilling a specific, meaningful component from a more complex string, possibly for the purpose of identifying or categorizing the entries based on this simplified domain-like identifier. This suggests a pattern of extracting key information from a structured but non-standard data format, highlighting the importance of the unique identifiers contained within the latter part of the input strings., and input as ['ann chang', 'achang_maaker.com'] output is maaker.com, input as ['bobby smith', 'bobt_sphynx.uk.co'] output is sphynx.uk.co, input as ['art lennox', 'art.lennox_svxn.com'] output is svxn.com, input as ['smith bagshaw', 'smith_bbbbb.com'] output is bbbbb.com, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
