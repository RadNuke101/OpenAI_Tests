Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Input Column Summary:

The input data consists of two columns. The first column contains strings representing date ranges in two formats: MM/DD/YY and MM/DD/YYYY. Each entry in this column is a string that includes two dates separated by a hyphen. The first date format is a short format where the year is represented by the last two digits (YY), while the second date format uses a four-digit year (YYYY). The month (MM) and day (DD) components are consistent across both formats.

The second column contains single-digit strings, either '1' or '2', which appear to serve as selectors or indicators.

### Output Column Summary:

The output data consists of single dates extracted from the date ranges provided in the first column of the input data. The format of the output dates matches the format of the dates in the input range. If the input date range is in the short year format (MM/DD/YY), the output date is also in this format. Similarly, if the input date range uses the full year format (MM/DD/YYYY), the output follows suit. The specific date extracted (either the start or end date of the range) is determined by the selector provided in the second input column.

### Relationship Summary:

The relationship between the input and output data is a function of both the date range provided and the selector value. The first part of the input determines the pool of possible dates (the start and end dates of a given range), while the second part of the input (the selector) determines which date from the range is outputted. Specifically:

- When the selector is '1', the output is the start date of the range.
- When the selector is '2', the output is the end date of the range.

This process effectively allows for the selection of a specific date from a given range based on the numerical indicator provided alongside the range. The format consistency between input and output ensures that the date representation style is preserved across the transformation., and input as ['1/17/16-1/18/17', '1'] output is 1/17/16, input as ['1/17/16-1/18/17', '2'] output is 1/18/17, input as ['01/17/2016-01/18/2017', '1'] output is 01/17/2016, input as ['01/17/2016-01/18/2017', '2'] output is 01/18/2017, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.

    Extracts a specific date from a given date range based on the selector value.
    
    Parameters:
    - date_range (str): A string representing a date range in the format "MM/DD/YY-MM/DD/YY" or "MM/DD/YYYY-MM/DD/YYYY".
    - selector (str): A single-digit string, either '1' or '2', indicating which date to extract from the range.
