Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Input Column Summary:

The input data consists of two columns. The first column contains strings representing date ranges in two formats: MM/DD/YY and MM/DD/YYYY. Each entry in this column includes two dates separated by a hyphen, indicating a start and end date. The formats are consistent within each entry but vary across the dataset, with some entries using a two-digit year format and others using a four-digit year format.

The second column is a single-digit numerical string, either '1' or '2', which appears to serve as an index or selector for the dates within the range specified in the first column.

### Output Column Summary:

The output data consists of a single column that contains dates corresponding to the input date ranges. The format of the output dates matches the format of the input dates, either MM/DD/YY or MM/DD/YYYY, depending on the format used in the respective input entry. The output date is determined based on the value in the second input column: a value of '1' selects the start date of the range, while a value of '2' selects the end date.

### Relationship Summary:

The relationship between the input and output columns is a function of selection based on the second input column. The process can be summarized as follows:

1. **Date Range Parsing**: The first input column provides a range of dates in a specific format. This range is delimited by a hyphen, indicating the start and end dates.

2. **Selection Index**: The second input column specifies which date within the range to select. A value of '1' indicates that the start date of the range should be selected, while a value of '2' indicates the selection of the end date.

3. **Output Generation**: The output is the selected date in the same format as provided in the input date range. The selection is directly influenced by the value in the second input column.

This relationship demonstrates a straightforward selection mechanism where the input data provides a context (date range) and a directive (which date to select), and the output is the result of applying this directive to the context. The process respects the format of the input dates, ensuring consistency in the output., and input as ['1/17/16-1/18/17', '1'] output is 1/17/16, input as ['1/17/16-1/18/17', '2'] output is 1/18/17, input as ['01/17/2016-01/18/2017', '1'] output is 01/17/2016, input as ['01/17/2016-01/18/2017', '2'] output is 01/18/2017, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
