Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Input Column Summary:

The input data consists of strings that are combinations of a brand name followed by a numeric value. The brand names observed in the dataset are "Ducati" and "Honda." The numeric values appended to these brand names are 100, 125, 250, and 550. These strings seem to represent models of motorcycles, where the brand name indicates the manufacturer, and the numeric value potentially represents a model identifier, which could be related to engine capacity or a model series. The dataset includes multiple instances of each brand, paired with different numeric values, suggesting a variety of models from each manufacturer.

### Output Column Summary:

The output data extracted from the input strings are purely the brand names of the motorcycles, which are "Ducati" and "Honda." This output data disregards the numeric values that were part of the input, focusing solely on the qualitative aspect of the motorcycle brand. The output is consistent across all instances where a particular brand is mentioned in the input, indicating a clear extraction or separation process that isolates the brand name from the model identifier.

### Relationship Summary:

The relationship between the input and output data is a process of extraction or separation, where the input strings, which are combinations of brand names and numeric values, are processed to isolate and output only the brand names. This process effectively removes the numeric model identifiers, leaving only the qualitative brand information. The relationship highlights a consistent mapping from a more complex string to a simpler, brand-only string, demonstrating a focus on the qualitative aspect of the data (the brand names) over the quantitative or numerical aspect (the model identifiers). This could be useful in contexts where the brand identity is more relevant than the specific model details, such as in brand recognition studies, market analysis focusing on brand popularity, or when categorizing data at a higher level of abstraction., and input as ['Ducati100'] output is Ducati, input as ['Honda125'] output is Honda, input as ['Ducati250'] output is Ducati, input as ['Honda250'] output is Honda, input as ['Honda550'] output is Honda, input as ['Ducati125'] output is Ducati, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
