Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Input Column Summary:

The input data consists of strings that are combinations of a brand name and a numeric value, without any space separating them. The brand names observed in the dataset are "Ducati" and "Honda." The numeric values attached to these brand names vary and include 100, 125, 250, and 550. These strings seem to represent models of motorcycles, where the brand name indicates the manufacturer, and the numeric value could potentially indicate model series, engine displacement, or another numerical classification related to the motorcycle model.

### Output Column Summary:

The output data extracted from the input strings consists solely of the brand names "Ducati" and "Honda." This indicates that the process or function applied to the input data extracts or isolates the brand name from the combined string, disregarding the numeric value that follows the brand name in the input.

### Relationship Summary:

The relationship between the input and output data is a transformation process where the input strings, which are combinations of motorcycle brand names and numeric values, are processed to extract only the brand names, discarding the numeric values. This transformation suggests that the purpose or function applied is designed to identify the brand of the motorcycle without considering the specific model or series indicated by the numeric value. The process is consistent across all input data, indicating a systematic approach to isolating brand names from a specific format of string that combines text and numbers., and input as ['Ducati100'] output is Ducati, input as ['Honda125'] output is Honda, input as ['Ducati250'] output is Ducati, input as ['Honda250'] output is Honda, input as ['Honda550'] output is Honda, input as ['Ducati125'] output is Ducati, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
