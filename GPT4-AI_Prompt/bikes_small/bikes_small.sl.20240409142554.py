Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Input Column Summary:

The input data consists of strings that are a combination of a brand name followed by a numeric value. The brand names observed in the dataset are "Ducati" and "Honda". The numeric values appended to these brand names vary and include 100, 125, 250, and 550. Each string in the input data uniquely identifies a model by combining the brand name with a specific numeric designation, presumably indicating a model variant or specification.

### Output Column Summary:

The output data extracts and isolates the brand name component from the input strings, disregarding the numeric value that follows. The output for each input string is either "Ducati" or "Honda", depending on the brand name present in the corresponding input string. This transformation strips away the model variant or specification detail, focusing solely on the brand identity.

### Relationship Summary:

The relationship between the input and output data is a process of extraction and simplification, where the input strings, which contain both qualitative (brand name) and quantitative (numeric value) elements, are processed to retain only the qualitative component. This process effectively removes the model-specific information, represented by the numeric value, and simplifies the data to highlight the brand identity alone. The transformation is consistent across all input data, indicating a systematic approach to isolating brand names from a more complex string that includes both brand and model information. This suggests that the primary interest or focus of this dataset or analysis is on the brand aspect, rather than the specific models or their specifications., and input as ['Ducati100'] output is Ducati, input as ['Honda125'] output is Honda, input as ['Ducati250'] output is Ducati, input as ['Honda250'] output is Honda, input as ['Honda550'] output is Honda, input as ['Ducati125'] output is Ducati, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
