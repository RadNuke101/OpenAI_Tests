Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Summary for Input Column Data:

The input data consists of two primary columns, each representing different aspects of educational institutions in the United States. The first column lists the names of various prestigious universities, including both their formal names (e.g., "University of Pennsylvania") and their commonly used abbreviations or informal names (e.g., "UCLA" for the University of California, Los Angeles). This column showcases a range of institutions recognized for their academic excellence, covering a broad geographical area across the United States.

The second column provides specific location information for each of these institutions. The locations are given with varying degrees of detail, from city and state (e.g., "Los Angeles, CA") to more comprehensive listings that include the country (e.g., "Ithaca, New York, USA"). Some entries abbreviate the state name, while others spell it out fully, indicating a lack of standardization in how location data is presented.

### Summary for Output Column Data:

The output data standardizes the location information provided in the second input column. It corrects any misspellings (e.g., "Phialdelphia" to "Philadelphia"), standardizes state abbreviations (e.g., converting "New York" to "NY"), and ensures consistency in format across all entries by appending ", USA" where necessary. This process creates a uniform presentation of location data, making it easier to understand and compare across different entries. The output focuses solely on the geographical locations of the institutions, omitting the names of the universities themselves.

### Relationship Between Input and Output:

The transformation from input to output demonstrates a process of standardization and correction of location data associated with various universities across the United States. The first column in the input data, which lists university names, serves as a contextual identifier but does not directly influence the output. Instead, the output is derived from the second column of the input data, which provides the raw location information. The process involves correcting any inaccuracies, standardizing the format for state names and the inclusion of the country, and ensuring consistency in how the location data is presented. This relationship highlights the importance of clear and standardized geographical identifiers in educational data, facilitating easier comparison and analysis of institutions based on their locations., and input as ['University of Pennsylvania', 'Phialdelphia, PA, USA'] output is Phialdelphia, PA, USA, input as ['UCLA', 'Los Angeles, CA'] output is Los Angeles, CA, USA, input as ['Cornell University', 'Ithaca, New York, USA'] output is Ithaca, NY, USA, input as ['Penn', 'Philadelphia, PA, USA'] output is Philadelphia, PA, USA, input as ['University of Maryland College Park', 'College Park, MD'] output is College Park, MD, USA, input as ['University of Michigan', 'Ann Arbor, MI, USA'] output is Ann Arbor, MI, USA, input as ['Columbia University', 'New York, NY, USA'] output is New York, NY, USA, input as ['NYU', 'New York, New York, USA'] output is New York, NY, USA, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
