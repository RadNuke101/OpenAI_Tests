Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Summary for Input Column Data:

The input data consists of two primary elements for each entry: the name of a university and its corresponding location. The universities mentioned span a range of well-known institutions across the United States, including both public and private entities. These universities are geographically diverse, located in various states such as Pennsylvania, California, New York, Maryland, and Michigan. The names of the universities are sometimes provided in their full official form (e.g., "University of Pennsylvania"), and other times in a more colloquial or abbreviated form (e.g., "Penn" for the University of Pennsylvania or "UCLA" for the University of California, Los Angeles). The locations are given with varying levels of detail, from city and state to full addresses that include the country, reflecting a mix of specificity in how locations are identified.

### Summary for Output Column Data:

The output data uniformly presents the locations of the universities mentioned in the input data, standardized to a consistent format that includes the city, the state abbreviation, and the country "USA" when not originally provided. This standardization process involves correcting misspellings (e.g., "Phialdelphia" to "Philadelphia"), abbreviating state names (e.g., "New York" to "NY"), and adding missing country information for entries within the United States. The output ensures a uniform presentation of location information, making it easier to understand and compare across entries.

### Relationship Between Input and Output:

The relationship between the input and output data demonstrates a process of standardization and correction of university location information. The input data's variability in university naming conventions and location detail level is streamlined in the output to a consistent format that emphasizes clarity and uniformity. This transformation process involves correcting typographical errors, standardizing state names to their abbreviations, and ensuring the inclusion of the country "USA" for all entries, thereby facilitating easier comparison and identification of the universities' geographical locations. The output serves as a refined and more accessible version of the location information initially provided in the input, highlighting the importance of consistency in data presentation., and input as ['University of Pennsylvania', 'Phialdelphia, PA, USA'] output is Phialdelphia, PA, USA, input as ['UCLA', 'Los Angeles, CA'] output is Los Angeles, CA, USA, input as ['Cornell University', 'Ithaca, New York, USA'] output is Ithaca, NY, USA, input as ['Penn', 'Philadelphia, PA, USA'] output is Philadelphia, PA, USA, input as ['University of Maryland College Park', 'College Park, MD'] output is College Park, MD, USA, input as ['University of Michigan', 'Ann Arbor, MI, USA'] output is Ann Arbor, MI, USA, input as ['Columbia University', 'New York, NY, USA'] output is New York, NY, USA, input as ['NYU', 'New York, New York, USA'] output is New York, NY, USA, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
