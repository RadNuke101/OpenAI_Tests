Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: To generate a summary that describes the relationship between the input and output data, let's first examine the structure of the inputs and the corresponding outputs provided:

### Input Data Structure:
- The input data is structured as a string that starts with a plus sign (+) followed by a country code, a space, and then a sequence of digits separated by hyphens. The sequence after the country code and space is divided into three groups by two hyphens.
- The format can be summarized as: `+[Country Code] [XXX-XXX-XXX]`
- Examples include: `+106 769-858-438`, `+83 973-757-831`, `+62 647-787-775`

### Output Data Structure:
- The output data extracts a specific part of the input data. Specifically, it extracts the first group of three digits that follow the country code and space.
- Examples corresponding to the inputs above are: `769`, `973`, `647`

### Summary of Relationship Between Input and Output:
- The output is consistently derived from the input by extracting the first group of three digits that immediately follow the country code and the initial space. This group of digits appears to represent a specific segment of the input data that is of interest for the output.
- The country code and the remaining digits after the first group of three digits do not influence the output.
- The process of deriving the output from the input does not involve any transformation or manipulation of the digits themselves; it is purely an extraction based on the position within the structured input.

### Summary for Input Column Data:
- The input data is qualitatively consistent in its structure across all examples, adhering to a format that includes a country code and a 9-digit number separated into three groups by hyphens.
- The variation in input data comes from the different country codes and the different sequences of digits.

### Summary for Output Column Data:
- The output data consistently represents a specific segment (the first group of three digits after the country code) from the structured input data.
- This output is qualitatively uniform in that it always consists of a group of three digits, though the specific digits vary across different inputs.

### Conclusion:
The relationship between the input and output data is defined by a consistent rule of extraction, where the output is always the first group of three digits following the country code in the input. This relationship indicates that the output could be serving as an identifier or a key segment within the larger string, possibly for categorization, filtering, or identification purposes in a larger dataset or system., and input as ['+106 769-858-438'] output is 769, input as ['+83 973-757-831'] output is 973, input as ['+62 647-787-775'] output is 647, input as ['+172 027-507-632'] output is 027, input as ['+72 001-050-856'] output is 001, input as ['+95 310-537-401'] output is 310, input as ['+6 775-969-238'] output is 775, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
