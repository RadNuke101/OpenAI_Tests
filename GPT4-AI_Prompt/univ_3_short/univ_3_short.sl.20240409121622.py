Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Input Column Summary:

The input data consists of two columns. The first column contains the names of various educational institutions, primarily universities located in the United States. These institutions range from well-known universities with global recognition, such as the University of Pennsylvania, UCLA (University of California, Los Angeles), and Cornell University, to other significant but perhaps less internationally famed institutions like the University of Maryland College Park and the University of Michigan. The diversity of universities mentioned spans across different states, including Pennsylvania, California, New York, Maryland, and Michigan, indicating a geographical variety within the United States.

The second column provides specific locations for these institutions, including the city and state. In some instances, the country (USA) is also mentioned, while in others, it is omitted. This column offers a more precise geographical pinpointing of where each university is situated, ranging from large cities like Los Angeles, California, to smaller towns like Ithaca, New York.

### Output Column Summary:

The output data consolidates the location information provided in the second column of the input data, with a slight modification for consistency in the inclusion of the country designation "USA." This ensures that each output entry uniformly ends with the country, making it clear that all these universities are located in the United States of America. The output retains the city and state information as provided in the input, ensuring that the geographical specificity is not lost. This uniformity in format aids in understanding the locations' national context, especially useful for an international audience.

### Relationship Summary:

The relationship between the input and output columns is a process of standardization and clarification of the location data associated with various universities. The input provides a pair of information: the name of the university and its location. The output, however, focuses solely on refining the location information to include a consistent mention of the USA, ensuring clarity and uniformity across all entries. This transformation highlights the geographical aspect of the input data, emphasizing the American context of these institutions without altering the essential details of their locations. The process serves to make the data more accessible and understandable, especially for those who might not be familiar with the assumption that all mentioned locations are within the United States., and input as ['University of Pennsylvania', 'Phialdelphia, PA, USA'] output is Phialdelphia, PA, USA, input as ['UCLA', 'Los Angeles, CA'] output is Los Angeles, CA, USA, input as ['Cornell University', 'Ithaca, New York, USA'] output is Ithaca, New York, USA, input as ['Penn', 'Philadelphia, PA, USA'] output is Philadelphia, PA, USA, input as ['University of Maryland College Park', 'College Park, MD'] output is College Park, MD, USA, input as ['University of Michigan', 'Ann Arbor, MI, USA'] output is Ann Arbor, MI, USA, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
