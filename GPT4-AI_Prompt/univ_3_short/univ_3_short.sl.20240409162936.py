Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Summary for Input Column Data:

The input data consists of two columns, with each row representing a specific university or college and its corresponding location. The first column contains the names of various higher education institutions, which include a mix of full university names (e.g., "University of Pennsylvania"), abbreviations (e.g., "UCLA"), and informal names (e.g., "Penn"). These institutions are located across different states in the USA, indicating a geographical diversity in the dataset.

The second column provides the location of each institution in a city and state format, with some entries also including the country ("USA"). The format of the location information varies slightly, with some entries providing a more detailed location by including the country, while others omit the country and only list the city and state. This column reflects the physical locations of the institutions mentioned in the first column, offering a direct geographical reference point for each.

### Summary for Output Column Data:

The output data is a standardized format of the location information provided in the second column of the input data. Each output entry corresponds to the location of the respective institution mentioned in the input data, formatted consistently to include the city, state, and, when not originally provided, the country ("USA"). This standardization process ensures uniformity in the presentation of location information, making it easier to understand and compare across different entries. The addition of "USA" to entries that originally lacked the country information helps clarify that all mentioned institutions are located within the United States, providing a clearer geographical context.

### Relationship Summary:

The relationship between the input and output data is a process of standardization and clarification of location information associated with various higher education institutions in the USA. The input data provides a base of information that includes both the name of the institution and its location, albeit in a slightly inconsistent format. The output data refines this by presenting the location information in a consistent and complete format, ensuring that each entry clearly indicates the city, state, and country. This transformation enhances the clarity and usability of the location data, making it more accessible and easier to interpret at a glance. The process underscores the importance of standardized data presentation, especially when dealing with geographical information that may originally be provided in varied formats., and input as ['University of Pennsylvania', 'Phialdelphia, PA, USA'] output is Phialdelphia, PA, USA, input as ['UCLA', 'Los Angeles, CA'] output is Los Angeles, CA, USA, input as ['Cornell University', 'Ithaca, New York, USA'] output is Ithaca, New York, USA, input as ['Penn', 'Philadelphia, PA, USA'] output is Philadelphia, PA, USA, input as ['University of Maryland College Park', 'College Park, MD'] output is College Park, MD, USA, input as ['University of Michigan', 'Ann Arbor, MI, USA'] output is Ann Arbor, MI, USA, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
