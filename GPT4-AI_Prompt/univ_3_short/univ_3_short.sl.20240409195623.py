Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Summary for Input Column Data:

The input data consists of two main components for each entry: the name of an educational institution and its associated location. The educational institutions mentioned are prominent universities located in the United States. These include a mix of private and public universities, covering a broad geographical range across the country. The locations provided alongside these institutions vary in detail, with some entries including just the city and state, while others also include the country, specifically the United States. The variation in the level of detail suggests a flexible format in how location information is presented. The names of the universities sometimes appear in their full official form (e.g., "University of Pennsylvania"), and other times in a more colloquial or abbreviated form (e.g., "Penn", "UCLA"). This indicates a diversity in how institutions are referred to, reflecting both formal and informal usage.

### Summary for Output Column Data:

The output data uniformly presents the location information associated with each educational institution mentioned in the input data. The format for the location information in the output is standardized to include the city, state abbreviation, and, when not originally present, the country "USA" is appended to ensure consistency and clarity. This standardization process addresses the variability seen in the input data regarding the level of detail provided for locations. The output effectively normalizes the location information, making it more uniform and easily understandable, regardless of the initial format or level of detail provided in the input.

### Relationship Summary:

The relationship between the input and output data revolves around the extraction and standardization of location information associated with various educational institutions in the United States. The process involves identifying the relevant location details from the input, which may be presented in varying levels of detail and formats, and then transforming this information into a consistent output format. This transformation includes ensuring that each location is clearly identified by city, state, and the inclusion of "USA" when necessary, to maintain uniformity across all entries. The output serves to provide a clear and standardized geographical reference for each institution, irrespective of the initial presentation style in the input data. This relationship highlights the importance of data normalization in enhancing clarity and comparability across a dataset., and input as ['University of Pennsylvania', 'Phialdelphia, PA, USA'] output is Phialdelphia, PA, USA, input as ['UCLA', 'Los Angeles, CA'] output is Los Angeles, CA, USA, input as ['Cornell University', 'Ithaca, New York, USA'] output is Ithaca, New York, USA, input as ['Penn', 'Philadelphia, PA, USA'] output is Philadelphia, PA, USA, input as ['University of Maryland College Park', 'College Park, MD'] output is College Park, MD, USA, input as ['University of Michigan', 'Ann Arbor, MI, USA'] output is Ann Arbor, MI, USA, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
