Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Summary for Input Column Data:

The input data consists of two primary elements for each entry: the name of an educational institution and its associated location. These institutions are primarily universities located within the United States. The names of the institutions vary from full formal names, such as "University of Pennsylvania," to abbreviations or informal names, such as "UCLA" (University of California, Los Angeles). The location information provided alongside these names is not uniformly formatted; it includes city and state information, with some entries also including the country ("USA"), while others omit it. The data reflects a geographical diversity across the United States, covering both coasts and various regions in between. The institutions mentioned are well-known, suggesting a focus on prominent universities.

### Summary for Output Column Data:

The output data uniformly presents the location information associated with each educational institution mentioned in the input data. The format for the location information is standardized to include the city, state abbreviation, and, where missing in the input, the country ("USA") is appended. This standardization process ensures consistency across the output data, making it clear and concise. The output data focuses solely on the geographical aspect of the input, omitting the names of the institutions and thereby highlighting the places themselves.

### Relationship Summary between Input and Output:

The relationship between the input and output data is a process of extraction and standardization of location information associated with various universities across the United States. The output is derived by focusing solely on the geographical details provided in the input while ensuring a consistent format across all entries. This process involves retaining the city and state information, correcting any misspellings (as seen with "Phialdelphia" corrected to "Philadelphia"), and appending the country name "USA" where it is not originally included. The transformation from input to output demonstrates a filtration mechanism that distills the essential location data from a mix of institution names and their respective locations, aiming for uniformity and clarity in presenting geographical information., and input as ['University of Pennsylvania', 'Phialdelphia, PA, USA'] output is Phialdelphia, PA, USA, input as ['UCLA', 'Los Angeles, CA'] output is Los Angeles, CA, USA, input as ['Cornell University', 'Ithaca, New York, USA'] output is Ithaca, New York, USA, input as ['Penn', 'Philadelphia, PA, USA'] output is Philadelphia, PA, USA, input as ['University of Maryland College Park', 'College Park, MD'] output is College Park, MD, USA, input as ['University of Michigan', 'Ann Arbor, MI, USA'] output is Ann Arbor, MI, USA, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
