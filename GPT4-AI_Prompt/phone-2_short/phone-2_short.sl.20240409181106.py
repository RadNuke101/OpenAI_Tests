Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Given the data and the relationship between the input and output, we can summarize the following:

### Input Column Summary:
- The input data is structured in a consistent format, represented as a string of numbers divided into three segments by hyphens (e.g., XXX-XXX-XXX).
- Each segment within the input strings contains three digits.
- The input data appears to be arbitrary or randomly generated, with no immediately discernible pattern or sequence among the different entries.
- The first two segments vary across the inputs, suggesting no direct correlation between these parts of the input and the output.

### Output Column Summary:
- The output data is consistently derived from the last segment of the input strings.
- It retains the three-digit format, including leading zeros when present.
- The output is directly extracted from the input, indicating a clear and straightforward relationship between the input and the output.

### Relationship Summary:
- The relationship between the input and the output is direct and simple: the output is always the last segment of the input string.
- This relationship suggests that the output can be predicted with 100% accuracy if the input format remains consistent, as the output solely depends on the last three digits of the input.
- There is no transformation or manipulation of the data from the input to the output; it is a simple extraction.
- The first two segments of the input do not influence the output, highlighting that only a specific portion of the input is relevant for determining the output.

In conclusion, the summary indicates a straightforward extraction process where the output is always the last three-digit segment of the input, with no alterations. This relationship is consistent across all provided examples, suggesting a rule or pattern that can be reliably used to predict the output from any given input following the same format., and input as ['938-242-504'] output is 504, input as ['308-916-545'] output is 545, input as ['623-599-749'] output is 749, input as ['981-424-843'] output is 843, input as ['118-980-214'] output is 214, input as ['244-655-094'] output is 094, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
