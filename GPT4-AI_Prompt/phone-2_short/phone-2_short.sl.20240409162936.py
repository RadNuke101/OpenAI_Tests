Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Given the examples provided, we can observe a clear pattern in the relationship between the input and output data. The input data is structured in a consistent format, where each entry is a string of numbers divided into three segments by hyphens. The format follows the pattern "XXX-XXX-XXX". The output data, on the other hand, is a subset of the input data, specifically the last segment of numbers following the second hyphen.

### Summary for Input Column Data:
- The input data is qualitative, represented as strings of numbers.
- Each entry follows a consistent format divided into three segments: "XXX-XXX-XXX".
- The segments are separated by hyphens.
- Each segment consists of three digits, ranging from 000 to 999, theoretically.

### Summary for Output Column Data:
- The output data is also qualitative, represented as strings of numbers.
- Each output entry corresponds to the last segment of its respective input entry.
- The output retains the three-digit format, including leading zeros when present.

### Relationship Summary:
- The relationship between the input and output data is direct and straightforward.
- The output is always the third segment of the input data, extracted from the position after the second hyphen.
- This relationship indicates that the output can be predicted with certainty if the input format is known and consistent.
- There is no transformation or manipulation of the data between the input and output beyond the extraction of the last segment.

This pattern suggests that if one were to encounter a new input following the same format, the output could be accurately predicted by simply extracting the last segment of numbers., and input as ['938-242-504'] output is 504, input as ['308-916-545'] output is 545, input as ['623-599-749'] output is 749, input as ['981-424-843'] output is 843, input as ['118-980-214'] output is 214, input as ['244-655-094'] output is 094, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
