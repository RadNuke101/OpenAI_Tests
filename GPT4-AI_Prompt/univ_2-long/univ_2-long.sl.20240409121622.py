Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Input Column Summary:

The input data consists of two columns, with each row representing a specific university or college and its corresponding location within the United States. The first column contains the name of the institution, which can range from well-known abbreviations (e.g., "UCLA", "MIT", "NYU", "UIUC") to full names (e.g., "University of Pennsylvania", "Cornell University", "Harvard University"). The second column provides the geographical location, including the city and state, with some entries also including the country designation "USA". Notably, the state is sometimes abbreviated, and the country is not consistently mentioned across all entries.

### Output Column Summary:

The output data consolidates the information from the two input columns into a single string per row, following the format: "Institution Name, City, State, USA". It standardizes the presentation of the geographical location by ensuring that "USA" is appended to each entry, even if it was originally omitted in the input data. This adjustment provides a uniform representation of the location, emphasizing that all mentioned institutions are based in the United States. The output maintains the original naming conventions of the institutions, whether they were provided in abbreviated form or full name.

### Relationship Summary:

The transformation from input to output data demonstrates a process of standardization and consolidation. By merging the institution name and its location into a single output string and appending "USA" to each entry, the process ensures a consistent format that highlights the American context of each university or college. This approach not only makes the geographical information more complete but also facilitates easier recognition of each institution's location at a glance. The relationship between the input and output underscores the importance of uniformity in data presentation, especially when dealing with qualitative information about educational institutions and their locations., and input as ['University of Pennsylvania', 'Phialdelphia, PA, USA'] output is University of Pennsylvania, Phialdelphia, PA, USA, input as ['UCLA', 'Los Angeles, CA'] output is UCLA, Los Angeles, CA, USA, input as ['Cornell University', 'Ithaca, New York, USA'] output is Cornell University, Ithaca, New York, USA, input as ['Penn', 'Philadelphia, PA, USA'] output is Penn, Philadelphia, PA, USA, input as ['University of Maryland College Park', 'College Park, MD'] output is University of Maryland College Park, College Park, MD, USA, input as ['University of Michigan', 'Ann Arbor, MI, USA'] output is University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA, input as ['UC Berkeley', 'Berkeley, CA'] output is UC Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA, input as ['MIT', 'Cambridge, MA'] output is MIT, Cambridge, MA, USA, input as ['Rice University', 'Houston, TX'] output is Rice University, Houston, TX, USA, input as ['Yale University', 'New Haven, CT, USA'] output is Yale University, New Haven, CT, USA, input as ['Columbia University', 'New York, NY, USA'] output is Columbia University, New York, NY, USA, input as ['NYU', 'New York, New York, USA'] output is NYU, New York, New York, USA, input as ['UC Berkeley', 'Berkeley, CA'] output is UC Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA, input as ['UIUC', 'Urbana, IL'] output is UIUC, Urbana, IL, USA, input as ['Temple University', 'Philadelphia, PA'] output is Temple University, Philadelphia, PA, USA, input as ['Harvard University', 'Cambridge, MA, USA'] output is Harvard University, Cambridge, MA, USA, input as ['University of Connecticut', 'Storrs, CT, USA'] output is University of Connecticut, Storrs, CT, USA, input as ['Drexel University', 'Philadelphia, PA'] output is Drexel University, Philadelphia, PA, USA, input as ['New Haven University', 'New Haven, CT, USA'] output is New Haven University, New Haven, CT, USA, input as ['University of California, Santa Barbara', 'Santa Barbara, CA, USA'] output is University of California, Santa Barbara, Santa Barbara, CA, USA, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
