Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Input Column Summary:

The input data consists of two primary elements for each entry: the name of an educational institution (mostly universities) and its geographical location. The geographical locations are provided with varying degrees of specificity, ranging from city and state to city, state, and country. The institutions listed are diverse, including a mix of public and private universities, well-known research universities, and specialized institutions across the United States. Some entries use formal names (e.g., "University of Pennsylvania"), while others use abbreviations or informal names (e.g., "UCLA" for University of California, Los Angeles). The state locations are abbreviated, and not all entries explicitly mention "USA" as the country.

### Output Column Summary:

The output data retains the structure of the input data but standardizes the geographical location information by ensuring that "USA" is explicitly mentioned in every entry, regardless of whether it was present in the original input. This addition standardizes the data format across all entries, making it clear that all the institutions listed are located in the United States of America. The output preserves the original naming conventions of the institutions, whether formal or informal, and maintains the original level of geographical detail provided, only appending ", USA" where it was missing.

### Relationship Between Input and Output:

The transformation from input to output data involves a standardization process focused on the geographical location component of each entry. The primary goal of this process is to make the country information explicit for every institution listed, ensuring uniformity across the dataset. This standardization is crucial for clarity, especially in contexts where the dataset might be shared or analyzed in an international setting, where the assumption of "USA" might not be immediately clear to all parties. The relationship between the input and output data underscores the importance of consistency in data presentation, particularly in terms of geographical information, without altering the essential identity or naming conventions of the institutions themselves., and input as ['University of Pennsylvania', 'Phialdelphia, PA, USA'] output is University of Pennsylvania, Phialdelphia, PA, USA, input as ['UCLA', 'Los Angeles, CA'] output is UCLA, Los Angeles, CA, USA, input as ['Cornell University', 'Ithaca, New York, USA'] output is Cornell University, Ithaca, New York, USA, input as ['Penn', 'Philadelphia, PA, USA'] output is Penn, Philadelphia, PA, USA, input as ['University of Maryland College Park', 'College Park, MD'] output is University of Maryland College Park, College Park, MD, USA, input as ['University of Michigan', 'Ann Arbor, MI, USA'] output is University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA, input as ['UC Berkeley', 'Berkeley, CA'] output is UC Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA, input as ['MIT', 'Cambridge, MA'] output is MIT, Cambridge, MA, USA, input as ['Rice University', 'Houston, TX'] output is Rice University, Houston, TX, USA, input as ['Yale University', 'New Haven, CT, USA'] output is Yale University, New Haven, CT, USA, input as ['Columbia University', 'New York, NY, USA'] output is Columbia University, New York, NY, USA, input as ['NYU', 'New York, New York, USA'] output is NYU, New York, New York, USA, input as ['UC Berkeley', 'Berkeley, CA'] output is UC Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA, input as ['UIUC', 'Urbana, IL'] output is UIUC, Urbana, IL, USA, input as ['Temple University', 'Philadelphia, PA'] output is Temple University, Philadelphia, PA, USA, input as ['Harvard University', 'Cambridge, MA, USA'] output is Harvard University, Cambridge, MA, USA, input as ['University of Connecticut', 'Storrs, CT, USA'] output is University of Connecticut, Storrs, CT, USA, input as ['Drexel University', 'Philadelphia, PA'] output is Drexel University, Philadelphia, PA, USA, input as ['New Haven University', 'New Haven, CT, USA'] output is New Haven University, New Haven, CT, USA, input as ['University of California, Santa Barbara', 'Santa Barbara, CA, USA'] output is University of California, Santa Barbara, Santa Barbara, CA, USA, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
