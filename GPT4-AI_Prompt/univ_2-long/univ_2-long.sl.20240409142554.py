Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Input Column Summary:

The input data consists of two primary columns, each containing distinct but related pieces of information about various educational institutions, primarily universities, across the United States. The first column lists the names of the institutions, which include a mix of full university names (e.g., "University of Pennsylvania"), abbreviations (e.g., "UCLA" for University of California, Los Angeles), and informal names (e.g., "Penn" as a shorthand for the University of Pennsylvania). The second column provides the geographical location of these institutions, including the city and state. In some instances, the country "USA" is also included, while in others, it is omitted, indicating a variation in the specificity of the location data provided.

### Output Column Summary:

The output data consolidates the information from the two input columns into a single, cohesive format. Each entry combines the name of the institution from the first column with its geographical location from the second column, separated by a comma. Notably, if the original input did not include "USA" in the location, it is appended in the output, ensuring a uniform mention of the country across all entries. This adjustment standardizes the data, making it clear that all mentioned institutions are located within the United States. The output format provides a clear, concise representation of each institution's name and location, facilitating easier identification and reference.

### Relationship Summary:

The transformation from the input columns to the output column demonstrates a process of data standardization and consolidation. By merging the institution names with their respective locations into a single string and ensuring the consistent mention of "USA" across all entries, the output provides a standardized format that enhances clarity and uniformity. This process not only makes the data more accessible by combining relevant pieces of information but also addresses any inconsistencies in the geographical data's specificity. The relationship between the input and output underscores the importance of data standardization, especially when dealing with qualitative data that may initially present variations in format and detail., and input as ['University of Pennsylvania', 'Phialdelphia, PA, USA'] output is University of Pennsylvania, Phialdelphia, PA, USA, input as ['UCLA', 'Los Angeles, CA'] output is UCLA, Los Angeles, CA, USA, input as ['Cornell University', 'Ithaca, New York, USA'] output is Cornell University, Ithaca, New York, USA, input as ['Penn', 'Philadelphia, PA, USA'] output is Penn, Philadelphia, PA, USA, input as ['University of Maryland College Park', 'College Park, MD'] output is University of Maryland College Park, College Park, MD, USA, input as ['University of Michigan', 'Ann Arbor, MI, USA'] output is University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA, input as ['UC Berkeley', 'Berkeley, CA'] output is UC Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA, input as ['MIT', 'Cambridge, MA'] output is MIT, Cambridge, MA, USA, input as ['Rice University', 'Houston, TX'] output is Rice University, Houston, TX, USA, input as ['Yale University', 'New Haven, CT, USA'] output is Yale University, New Haven, CT, USA, input as ['Columbia University', 'New York, NY, USA'] output is Columbia University, New York, NY, USA, input as ['NYU', 'New York, New York, USA'] output is NYU, New York, New York, USA, input as ['UC Berkeley', 'Berkeley, CA'] output is UC Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA, input as ['UIUC', 'Urbana, IL'] output is UIUC, Urbana, IL, USA, input as ['Temple University', 'Philadelphia, PA'] output is Temple University, Philadelphia, PA, USA, input as ['Harvard University', 'Cambridge, MA, USA'] output is Harvard University, Cambridge, MA, USA, input as ['University of Connecticut', 'Storrs, CT, USA'] output is University of Connecticut, Storrs, CT, USA, input as ['Drexel University', 'Philadelphia, PA'] output is Drexel University, Philadelphia, PA, USA, input as ['New Haven University', 'New Haven, CT, USA'] output is New Haven University, New Haven, CT, USA, input as ['University of California, Santa Barbara', 'Santa Barbara, CA, USA'] output is University of California, Santa Barbara, Santa Barbara, CA, USA, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
