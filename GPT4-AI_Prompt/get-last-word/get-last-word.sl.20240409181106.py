Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Input Column Summary:

The input data consists of phrases or sentences that appear to be snippets of advice, observations, or questions regarding life, productivity, and philosophy. Each entry in the input column is distinct but shares a commonality in that they all seem to provoke thought or offer a perspective on how to approach life or specific situations within it. The phrases range from practical advice ("focus on one thing at a time") to reflections on broader concepts ("premature optimization is the root of all evil", albeit with a typo in 'opt' instead of 'optimization'). There's also a direct question about existence ("where is life"), indicating a variety in the type of content presented. These inputs seem to be designed to elicit a specific keyword or idea that encapsulates the essence or moral of the statement.

### Output Column Summary:

The output data is a collection of single words ("time", "evil", "life") that appear to distill the essence or key focus of each input phrase. Each output word serves as a summary or the most significant element of the corresponding input, suggesting a process of abstraction or reduction to the most critical concept within each phrase. The output words are diverse in their scope, covering concepts of temporal focus, moral judgment, and existential inquiry, which aligns with the varied nature of the input data.

### Relationship Between Input and Output:

The relationship between the input and output data is characterized by a process of extraction and summarization, where the output serves as a distilled essence or focal point of the input phrases. This process suggests a methodical approach to understanding and interpreting the input data, where the goal is to identify the most significant word or concept that captures the core message or inquiry presented in each input. The output effectively acts as a keyword or a thematic anchor for each input, providing a concise reference point that encapsulates the broader or more complex ideas conveyed in the full phrases. This relationship underscores a practice of critical thinking and synthesis, where the ability to distill complex ideas into their most impactful elements is key., and input as ['focus on one thing at a time'] output is time, input as ['premature opt is the root of all evil'] output is evil, input as ['where is life'] output is life, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
