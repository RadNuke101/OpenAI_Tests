Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Summary of Input Column Data:

The input data consists of a series of phrases or statements that encapsulate advice, observations, or inquiries about life, productivity, and philosophy. Each phrase is distinct in its focus but shares a commonality in prompting reflection or offering a perspective on a specific aspect of human experience or behavior. The phrases range from advice on productivity and focus, such as "focus on one thing at a time," to philosophical musings about the nature of evil and the essence of life itself. This variety suggests that the input data is concerned with exploring different facets of human thought and action, providing a broad yet insightful look into the complexities of navigating life's challenges and questions.

### Summary of Output Column Data:

The output data consists of single words: "time," "evil," and "life." These words appear to be the essence or focal point extracted from each corresponding input phrase. They represent key concepts or themes that are central to the message or inquiry presented in the input data. The output words are abstract and carry significant weight in philosophical, ethical, and existential discussions. They encapsulate broad areas of human concern and interest, ranging from the practical and immediate, such as how one manages their time, to the profound and universal, such as the nature of evil and the meaning of life.

### Summary Describing the Relationship Between Input and Output:

The relationship between the input and output data can be characterized as a process of distillation or extraction, where a key concept or theme is identified from a broader statement or question. This process highlights the core focus or concern of each input phrase, simplifying complex ideas or advice into a single, impactful word. The output serves as a thematic anchor for each input, providing a concise summary or representation of the broader message or inquiry. This relationship underscores the ability of language to encapsulate complex and multifaceted ideas into singular words, which can then serve as a catalyst for deeper reflection or action. The input phrases prompt consideration of various aspects of human experience, while the output words distill these considerations into central themes, facilitating a focused exploration of these ideas., and input as ['focus on one thing at a time'] output is time, input as ['premature opt is the root of all evil'] output is evil, input as ['where is life'] output is life, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
