Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Input Column Summary:

The input data consists of four columns. The first column contains phrases or sentences describing various scenes or objects, with a focus on colors and sometimes specific items or elements (e.g., "yellow dog on green grass"). The subsequent three columns seem to list specific keywords or elements ('yellow', 'green', 'dog') that are to be identified within the phrases or sentences of the first column. The content of these columns suggests a pattern or criteria being applied to the phrases in the first column, with a particular emphasis on color (yellow and green) and an object or entity (dog).

### Output Column Summary:

The output data is a binary indicator (true or false), which appears to reflect whether the criteria or elements specified in the second, third, and fourth input columns are all present within the phrase or sentence in the first input column. A 'true' output indicates that all specified elements (both colors and the object) are mentioned or implied in the description, while a 'false' output suggests that one or more of the specified elements are missing from the description.

### Relationship Summary:

The relationship between the input and output columns is based on the presence or absence of specific elements (colors and objects) within the descriptive phrases or sentences of the first input column. The output (true or false) is determined by checking if the keywords listed in the subsequent three input columns are all found within the first column's content. This suggests a filtering or matching process where the criteria (colors and object) must be fully met for the output to be 'true'. The process seems to evaluate the textual content for specific features, indicating a form of qualitative analysis focused on the identification of mentioned attributes within a given text., and input as ['yellow dog on green grass', 'yellow', 'green', 'dog'] output is true, input as ['warm gray sweater', 'yellow', 'green', 'dog'] output is false, input as ['A yellow sun in a green field', 'yellow', 'green', 'dog'] output is true, input as ['yellow neon sign with a green background', 'yellow', 'green', 'dog'] output is true, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
