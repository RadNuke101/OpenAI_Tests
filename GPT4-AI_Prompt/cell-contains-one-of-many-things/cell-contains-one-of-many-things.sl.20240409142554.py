Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Summary for Input Column Data

The input data consists of a collection of sentences or phrases, each followed by a set of keywords. The first part of each input is a descriptive sentence that may or may not contain elements described by the subsequent keywords. These keywords are consistent across the dataset, specifically 'yellow', 'green', and 'dog'. The sentences vary in context, ranging from descriptions of scenes, objects, or scenarios, where the presence of the mentioned keywords can be literal or metaphorical. The keywords seem to act as filters or criteria that the sentences are evaluated against.

1. **Descriptive Sentences**: These are varied in nature but are primarily focused on visual imagery, describing colors, objects, and sometimes actions or settings. They provide the context in which the keywords need to be identified or related.

2. **Keywords**: 'Yellow', 'green', and 'dog' are the constant keywords across the inputs. They are used to assess the presence or relevance of these elements within the descriptive sentences.

### Summary for Output Column Data

The output data is binary, represented by true or false values. These outputs are determined based on whether the descriptive sentences meet certain criteria defined implicitly by the keywords 'yellow', 'green', and 'dog'. 

- **True**: Indicates that the criteria set by the keywords are met within the descriptive sentence. This could mean that all the keywords are present or relevant in the context of the description.
- **False**: Indicates that the criteria are not fully met, which could mean that one or more keywords are missing or irrelevant in the context of the description.

### Relationship Summary Between Input and Output

The relationship between the input and output data hinges on the presence and relevance of the specified keywords within the descriptive sentences. The output is true when the descriptive sentence includes or pertains to all the keywords provided ('yellow', 'green', and 'dog'). This suggests a direct correlation between the explicit mention or implied presence of these keywords in the sentence and the true output. Conversely, the absence or irrelevance of one or more keywords in the context of the sentence results in a false output.

This relationship underscores a filtering or matching process, where the descriptive sentences are evaluated based on the criteria set by the keywords. The true or false output serves as an indicator of whether the sentence successfully incorporates or relates to the keywords 'yellow', 'green', and 'dog', either through direct mention or through an implied presence that can be inferred from the context., and input as ['yellow dog on green grass', 'yellow', 'green', 'dog'] output is true, input as ['warm gray sweater', 'yellow', 'green', 'dog'] output is false, input as ['A yellow sun in a green field', 'yellow', 'green', 'dog'] output is true, input as ['yellow neon sign with a green background', 'yellow', 'green', 'dog'] output is true, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
