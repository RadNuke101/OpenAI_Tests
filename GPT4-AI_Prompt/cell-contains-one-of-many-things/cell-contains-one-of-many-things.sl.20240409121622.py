Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Input Column Summary:

The input data consists of four columns. The first column contains phrases or sentences that describe various scenes, objects, or situations. These descriptions are diverse, ranging from animals on grass to weather conditions, clothing items, and environmental settings. The next three columns contain specific keywords: 'yellow', 'green', and 'dog'. These keywords are consistent across all input rows, suggesting they are criteria used to evaluate the first column's content.

### Output Column Summary:

The output data is binary, represented by true or false values. These values seem to be determined based on the presence or absence of the keywords listed in the last three columns of the input data within the phrase or sentence described in the first column.

### Relationship Summary:

The relationship between the input and output columns appears to be a logical evaluation based on the presence of certain keywords within the descriptive phrases or sentences. Specifically, the output is true when all the keywords ('yellow', 'green', 'dog') are found within the first column's description. This indicates a rule-based system where the output is contingent upon the inclusion of all specified keywords within the descriptive text. The presence of 'yellow' and 'green' might suggest a color-based criteria, while 'dog' introduces an element of subject matter into the evaluation. The true or false output reflects whether the description successfully incorporates all these elements., and input as ['yellow dog on green grass', 'yellow', 'green', 'dog'] output is true, input as ['warm gray sweater', 'yellow', 'green', 'dog'] output is false, input as ['A yellow sun in a green field', 'yellow', 'green', 'dog'] output is true, input as ['yellow neon sign with a green background', 'yellow', 'green', 'dog'] output is true, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.

    - keyword2 (str): The second keyword to look for in the description.
    - keyword3 (str): The third keyword to look for in the description.
    
    Returns:
    - bool: True if all keywords are found in the description, False otherwise.
