Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Input Column Summary:

The input data consists of a list of full names, each presented as a single string within an array. These names are composed of two parts: the first name and the last name, separated by a space. The dataset includes a diverse range of names, indicating a variety of cultural backgrounds. Each entry is unique, suggesting that the data might represent individuals from a broad demographic or a specific group of people, such as members of an organization, participants in a study, or characters in a narrative. The names are presented in a consistent format, with the first name followed by the last name, which aids in the identification and processing of the data.

### Output Column Summary:

The output data extracts and presents the first name from each full name provided in the input data. This process involves separating the first name from the last name and discarding the latter. The output retains the original format of the first names, including capitalization, which suggests that the transformation process respects the integrity of the input data. The output data, like the input, showcases a variety of names, reflecting the diversity observed in the input column. This simplification of the data could serve purposes such as personalization, identification, or any context where the full name is unnecessary, and the first name suffices.

### Relationship Between Input and Output:

The relationship between the input and output data is a process of extraction and simplification. The input data, consisting of full names, is processed to isolate and output only the first names. This transformation indicates a focus on the individual's primary identifier (the first name) for scenarios where the specificity of the full name is not required. The consistent format between the input and output suggests a systematic approach to handling the data, likely automated, to ensure accuracy and efficiency in the extraction process. This relationship underscores the utility of data processing in tailoring information to meet specific needs or constraints, such as user interface design, database management, or communication strategies., and input as ['Nancy FreeHafer'] output is Nancy, input as ['Andrew Cencici'] output is Andrew, input as ['Jan Kotas'] output is Jan, input as ['Mariya Sergienko'] output is Mariya, input as ['Launa Withers'] output is Launa, input as ['Lakenya Edison'] output is Lakenya, input as ['Brendan Hage'] output is Brendan, input as ['Bradford Lango'] output is Bradford, input as ['Rudolf Akiyama'] output is Rudolf, input as ['Lara Constable'] output is Lara, input as ['Madelaine Ghoston'] output is Madelaine, input as ['Salley Hornak'] output is Salley, input as ['Micha Junkin'] output is Micha, input as ['Teddy Bobo'] output is Teddy, input as ['Coralee Scalia'] output is Coralee, input as ['Jeff Quashie'] output is Jeff, input as ['Vena Babiarz'] output is Vena, input as ['Karrie Lain'] output is Karrie, input as ['Tobias Dermody'] output is Tobias, input as ['Celsa Hopkins'] output is Celsa, input as ['Kimberley Halpern'] output is Kimberley, input as ['Phillip Rowden'] output is Phillip, input as ['Elias Neil'] output is Elias, input as ['Lashanda Cortes'] output is Lashanda, input as ['Mackenzie Spell'] output is Mackenzie, input as ['Kathlyn Eccleston'] output is Kathlyn, input as ['Georgina Brescia'] output is Georgina, input as ['Beata Miah'] output is Beata, input as ['Desiree Seamons'] output is Desiree, input as ['Jeanice Soderstrom'] output is Jeanice, input as ['Mariel Jurgens'] output is Mariel, input as ['Alida Bogle'] output is Alida, input as ['Jacqualine Olague'] output is Jacqualine, input as ['Joaquin Clasen'] output is Joaquin, input as ['Samuel Richert'] output is Samuel, input as ['Malissa Marcus'] output is Malissa, input as ['Alaina Partida'] output is Alaina, input as ['Trinidad Mulloy'] output is Trinidad, input as ['Carlene Garrard'] output is Carlene, input as ['Melodi Chism'] output is Melodi, input as ['Bess Chilcott'] output is Bess, input as ['Chong Aylward'] output is Chong, input as ['Jani Ramthun'] output is Jani, input as ['Jacquiline Heintz'] output is Jacquiline, input as ['Hayley Marquess'] output is Hayley, input as ['Andria Spagnoli'] output is Andria, input as ['Irwin Covelli'] output is Irwin, input as ['Gertude Montiel'] output is Gertude, input as ['Stefany Reily'] output is Stefany, input as ['Rae Mcgaughey'] output is Rae, input as ['Cruz Latimore'] output is Cruz, input as ['Maryann Casler'] output is Maryann, input as ['Annalisa Gregori'] output is Annalisa, input as ['Jenee Pannell'] output is Jenee, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
