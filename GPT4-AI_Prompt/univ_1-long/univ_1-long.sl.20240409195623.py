Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Input Column Summary:

The input data consists of two distinct columns, each representing a different aspect of information related to various universities and colleges across the United States. The first column contains the names of the institutions, which range from well-known universities such as "University of Pennsylvania" and "Harvard University" to more specific institutions like "New Haven University". This variety showcases a broad spectrum of higher education establishments, including both public and private institutions, as well as those specializing in a wide range of academic disciplines.

The second column provides geographical information, specifying the city and state where each institution is located. In some cases, the country ("USA") is also included, indicating that all these institutions are based in the United States. The geographical data varies in detail, with some entries providing a comprehensive address that includes the city, state, and country, while others omit the country, likely assuming it as given.

### Output Column Summary:

The output data consolidates the information provided in the two input columns into a single, cohesive format. Each entry in the output column combines the name of the institution from the first input column with its geographical location from the second input column, separated by a comma. This format provides a clear and concise way to present the name and location of each institution in a standardized manner, making it easy to identify and understand the relationship between the institution and its geographical setting. The inclusion of both the institution's name and its location in the output allows for a quick reference to where these institutions are based, catering to the needs of individuals seeking information on higher education options within the United States.

### Relationship Summary:

The relationship between the input and output columns is characterized by a transformation process that merges two pieces of related information into a single, streamlined format. The first input column, which lists the names of various higher education institutions, and the second input column, which provides their geographical locations, are combined in the output to offer a comprehensive view of each institution's identity and location. This process enhances the utility of the data by making it more accessible and informative for users, who can now easily associate each institution with its specific location in the United States. The standardized format of the output also facilitates easier comparison and reference among the listed institutions., and input as ['University of Pennsylvania', 'Phialdelphia, PA, USA'] output is University of Pennsylvania, Phialdelphia, PA, USA, input as ['UCLA', 'Los Angeles, CA'] output is UCLA, Los Angeles, CA, input as ['Cornell University', 'Ithaca, New York, USA'] output is Cornell University, Ithaca, New York, USA, input as ['Penn', 'Philadelphia, PA, USA'] output is Penn, Philadelphia, PA, USA, input as ['University of Maryland College Park', 'College Park, MD'] output is University of Maryland College Park, College Park, MD, input as ['University of Michigan', 'Ann Arbor, MI, USA'] output is University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA, input as ['UC Berkeley', 'Berkeley, CA'] output is UC Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, input as ['MIT', 'Cambridge, MA'] output is MIT, Cambridge, MA, input as ['Rice University', 'Houston, TX'] output is Rice University, Houston, TX, input as ['Yale University', 'New Haven, CT, USA'] output is Yale University, New Haven, CT, USA, input as ['Columbia University', 'New York, NY, USA'] output is Columbia University, New York, NY, USA, input as ['NYU', 'New York, New York, USA'] output is NYU, New York, New York, USA, input as ['UC Berkeley', 'Berkeley, CA'] output is UC Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, input as ['UIUC', 'Urbana, IL'] output is UIUC, Urbana, IL, input as ['Temple University', 'Philadelphia, PA'] output is Temple University, Philadelphia, PA, input as ['Harvard University', 'Cambridge, MA, USA'] output is Harvard University, Cambridge, MA, USA, input as ['University of Connecticut', 'Storrs, CT, USA'] output is University of Connecticut, Storrs, CT, USA, input as ['Drexel University', 'Philadelphia, PA'] output is Drexel University, Philadelphia, PA, input as ['New Haven University', 'New Haven, CT, USA'] output is New Haven University, New Haven, CT, USA, input as ['University of California, Santa Barbara', 'Santa Barbara, CA, USA'] output is University of California, Santa Barbara, Santa Barbara, CA, USA, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
