Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Input Column Summary:

The input data consists of two columns, each row containing information about a specific university or college. The first column includes the name of the institution, which can range from well-known abbreviations (e.g., "MIT", "UCLA", "NYU") to full names (e.g., "University of Michigan", "Cornell University"). These names represent a diverse set of higher education institutions across the United States, covering a wide geographical area and including both public and private universities.

The second column provides the location of each institution, typically formatted as the city and state abbreviation, though some entries also include the country ("USA") for clarity. This column helps to identify the specific campus or location of the institution, as some universities (e.g., "University of California") have multiple campuses across a state.

### Output Column Summary:

The output data consolidates the information from the two input columns into a single string for each row, combining the name of the institution with its location. The format is consistent across entries, with the university or college name followed by a comma, then the location (city, state abbreviation, and occasionally the country). This output format provides a concise yet comprehensive identification of each institution, making it easy to understand the specific campus or location being referred to.

### Relationship Between Input and Output:

The relationship between the input columns and the output column is a transformation process that merges the separate pieces of information (institution name and location) into a single, coherent string. This process involves concatenating the two input columns with a comma separator, ensuring that the output is easily readable and immediately recognizable. The transformation maintains the integrity of the original data while presenting it in a more streamlined and accessible format, suitable for quick reference or use in databases and listings where space or format might be limited. This summary format is particularly useful for distinguishing between campuses of universities with multiple locations and for providing clear geographical context for each institution., and input as ['University of Pennsylvania', 'Phialdelphia, PA, USA'] output is University of Pennsylvania, Phialdelphia, PA, USA, input as ['UCLA', 'Los Angeles, CA'] output is UCLA, Los Angeles, CA, input as ['Cornell University', 'Ithaca, New York, USA'] output is Cornell University, Ithaca, New York, USA, input as ['Penn', 'Philadelphia, PA, USA'] output is Penn, Philadelphia, PA, USA, input as ['University of Maryland College Park', 'College Park, MD'] output is University of Maryland College Park, College Park, MD, input as ['University of Michigan', 'Ann Arbor, MI, USA'] output is University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA, input as ['UC Berkeley', 'Berkeley, CA'] output is UC Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, input as ['MIT', 'Cambridge, MA'] output is MIT, Cambridge, MA, input as ['Rice University', 'Houston, TX'] output is Rice University, Houston, TX, input as ['Yale University', 'New Haven, CT, USA'] output is Yale University, New Haven, CT, USA, input as ['Columbia University', 'New York, NY, USA'] output is Columbia University, New York, NY, USA, input as ['NYU', 'New York, New York, USA'] output is NYU, New York, New York, USA, input as ['UC Berkeley', 'Berkeley, CA'] output is UC Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, input as ['UIUC', 'Urbana, IL'] output is UIUC, Urbana, IL, input as ['Temple University', 'Philadelphia, PA'] output is Temple University, Philadelphia, PA, input as ['Harvard University', 'Cambridge, MA, USA'] output is Harvard University, Cambridge, MA, USA, input as ['University of Connecticut', 'Storrs, CT, USA'] output is University of Connecticut, Storrs, CT, USA, input as ['Drexel University', 'Philadelphia, PA'] output is Drexel University, Philadelphia, PA, input as ['New Haven University', 'New Haven, CT, USA'] output is New Haven University, New Haven, CT, USA, input as ['University of California, Santa Barbara', 'Santa Barbara, CA, USA'] output is University of California, Santa Barbara, Santa Barbara, CA, USA, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
