Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Input Column Summary:

The input data consists of two distinct columns, each containing qualitative information about higher education institutions in the United States. The first column lists the names of universities and colleges, which vary from well-known public and private institutions to more specialized or less commonly referenced schools. These names include both formal names (e.g., "University of Pennsylvania") and informal or abbreviated names (e.g., "UCLA" for the University of California, Los Angeles). The second column provides the geographical location of each institution, specified by the city and state, with some entries also including the country ("USA") for additional clarity. This column sometimes presents variations in the level of detail, such as the inclusion or exclusion of "USA" and varying representations of state names (abbreviations vs. full names).

### Output Column Summary:

The output data consolidates the information from the two input columns into a single, cohesive string for each institution. It follows a consistent format where the university or college name is immediately followed by its geographical location, separated by a comma. This format standardizes the presentation of the data, making it easier to read and understand the association between an institution and its location. The output retains the original naming conventions and levels of geographical detail provided in the input columns, including the use of both formal and informal names for the institutions and the varying representations of state names and the inclusion of the country.

### Relationship Summary:

The relationship between the input and output data is a transformation process that merges two pieces of qualitative information (institution name and location) into a single, formatted string. This process enhances the readability and usability of the data by providing a standardized way to present each institution's name alongside its geographical context. The transformation respects the original data's nuances, such as the naming conventions for each institution and the level of detail in the location information, ensuring that the output remains true to the input while offering a more streamlined presentation. This approach facilitates easier identification and reference to specific institutions within the broader context of higher education in the United States., and input as ['University of Pennsylvania', 'Phialdelphia, PA, USA'] output is University of Pennsylvania, Phialdelphia, PA, USA, input as ['UCLA', 'Los Angeles, CA'] output is UCLA, Los Angeles, CA, input as ['Cornell University', 'Ithaca, New York, USA'] output is Cornell University, Ithaca, New York, USA, input as ['Penn', 'Philadelphia, PA, USA'] output is Penn, Philadelphia, PA, USA, input as ['University of Maryland College Park', 'College Park, MD'] output is University of Maryland College Park, College Park, MD, input as ['University of Michigan', 'Ann Arbor, MI, USA'] output is University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA, input as ['UC Berkeley', 'Berkeley, CA'] output is UC Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, input as ['MIT', 'Cambridge, MA'] output is MIT, Cambridge, MA, input as ['Rice University', 'Houston, TX'] output is Rice University, Houston, TX, input as ['Yale University', 'New Haven, CT, USA'] output is Yale University, New Haven, CT, USA, input as ['Columbia University', 'New York, NY, USA'] output is Columbia University, New York, NY, USA, input as ['NYU', 'New York, New York, USA'] output is NYU, New York, New York, USA, input as ['UC Berkeley', 'Berkeley, CA'] output is UC Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, input as ['UIUC', 'Urbana, IL'] output is UIUC, Urbana, IL, input as ['Temple University', 'Philadelphia, PA'] output is Temple University, Philadelphia, PA, input as ['Harvard University', 'Cambridge, MA, USA'] output is Harvard University, Cambridge, MA, USA, input as ['University of Connecticut', 'Storrs, CT, USA'] output is University of Connecticut, Storrs, CT, USA, input as ['Drexel University', 'Philadelphia, PA'] output is Drexel University, Philadelphia, PA, input as ['New Haven University', 'New Haven, CT, USA'] output is New Haven University, New Haven, CT, USA, input as ['University of California, Santa Barbara', 'Santa Barbara, CA, USA'] output is University of California, Santa Barbara, Santa Barbara, CA, USA, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.

def generated_function(name, location):
    """
    This function takes two strings: the name of a higher education institution and its geographical location,
    and returns a single string that combines these two pieces of information in a standardized format.
    
    Parameters:
    name (str): The name of the university or college.
    location (str): The geographical location of the institution, specified by city and state, and sometimes country.
    
    Returns:
    str: A single string that combines the institution's name and location, separated by a comma.
