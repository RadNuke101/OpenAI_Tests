Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Input Column Summary:

The input data consists of two columns, with each row representing a specific university or college and its corresponding location in the United States. The first column contains the name of the institution, which varies from full names like "University of Pennsylvania" to abbreviations such as "UCLA" (University of California, Los Angeles). This variety indicates a mix of formal and informal naming conventions for higher education institutions. The second column provides the geographical location of each institution, but the format is not consistent across entries. Some locations are fully detailed with the city, state, and country ("Philadelphia, PA, USA"), while others might omit the country ("Los Angeles, CA") or provide varying levels of detail.

### Output Column Summary:

The output data standardizes the format of the geographical locations associated with each institution from the input data. Each entry in the output column provides a consistent format that includes the city, state abbreviation, and the country ("USA"), even if the original input did not specify the country. This standardization process ensures that each location is clearly identified and uniformly presented, making it easier to understand and compare the geographical settings of different institutions.

### Relationship Summary:

The relationship between the input and output columns illustrates a process of standardization and clarification of geographical locations associated with various higher education institutions in the United States. The transformation from input to output corrects inconsistencies in the presentation of location data, such as missing country information or variations in detail. This process enhances the clarity and uniformity of the location information, making it more accessible and useful for comparison or analysis purposes. The output effectively addresses any ambiguities or inconsistencies present in the original input, ensuring that each institution's location is presented in a clear, consistent format., and input as ['University of Pennsylvania', 'Phialdelphia, PA, USA'] output is Phialdelphia, PA, USA, input as ['UCLA', 'Los Angeles, CA'] output is Los Angeles, CA, USA, input as ['Cornell University', 'Ithaca, New York, USA'] output is Ithaca, New York, USA, input as ['Penn', 'Philadelphia, PA, USA'] output is Philadelphia, PA, USA, input as ['University of Maryland College Park', 'College Park, MD'] output is College Park, MD, USA, input as ['University of Michigan', 'Ann Arbor, MI, USA'] output is Ann Arbor, MI, USA, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
