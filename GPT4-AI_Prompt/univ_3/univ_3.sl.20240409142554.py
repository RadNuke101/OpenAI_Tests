Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Summary for Input Column Data:

The input data consists of two primary elements for each entry: the name of an educational institution and its associated location. These institutions are primarily universities located within the United States. The names of the institutions vary from full names, such as "University of Pennsylvania," to abbreviations or informal names, such as "UCLA" for the University of California, Los Angeles, and "Penn" as a shorthand for the University of Pennsylvania. The locations provided alongside these institutions include the city and state, with some entries also specifying the country, "USA." The geographical scope within the input data is diverse, covering various states such as Pennsylvania, California, New York, Maryland, and Michigan. This variation in naming conventions for the institutions and the level of detail in the location information indicates a broad spectrum of how educational institutions and their locations can be represented.

### Summary for Output Column Data:

The output data standardizes the format of the location information associated with each educational institution. Regardless of the level of detail or naming convention used in the input data, the output consistently presents the location as a combination of the city, state abbreviation, and the country "USA" (when not already specified). This standardization process simplifies and unifies the way locations are represented, making it easier to understand and compare the geographical settings of these institutions. The output corrects any misspellings observed in the input (e.g., "Phialdelphia" to "Philadelphia") and ensures a uniform presentation of location data across all entries.

### Relationship Summary:

The relationship between the input and output data demonstrates a process of standardization and correction for the location information associated with various educational institutions in the United States. While the input data varies in the level of detail and accuracy (including naming conventions for the institutions and the specificity of the location information), the output focuses solely on providing a consistent and corrected format for representing the locations. This process involves appending the country "USA" where it is missing, correcting misspellings, and ensuring that each location is represented by the city, state abbreviation, and country. This transformation facilitates a clearer and more uniform understanding of where each institution is located, enhancing the usability and comparability of the location data., and input as ['University of Pennsylvania', 'Phialdelphia, PA, USA'] output is Phialdelphia, PA, USA, input as ['UCLA', 'Los Angeles, CA'] output is Los Angeles, CA, USA, input as ['Cornell University', 'Ithaca, New York, USA'] output is Ithaca, New York, USA, input as ['Penn', 'Philadelphia, PA, USA'] output is Philadelphia, PA, USA, input as ['University of Maryland College Park', 'College Park, MD'] output is College Park, MD, USA, input as ['University of Michigan', 'Ann Arbor, MI, USA'] output is Ann Arbor, MI, USA, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
