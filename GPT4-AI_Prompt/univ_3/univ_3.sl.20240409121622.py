Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Summary for Input Column Data:

The input data consists of two columns, with each row representing a specific educational institution in the United States. The first column contains the names of universities or colleges, which vary from well-known national universities to more specific campuses within a larger university system. These names include both formal names, such as "University of Pennsylvania," and informal or abbreviated names, such as "Penn" or "UCLA." This variety indicates a broad representation of how institutions are referred to colloquially or officially.

The second column provides the geographical location of each institution. However, the format of these locations is not consistent across entries. Some locations are provided with a full address format, including the city, state abbreviation, and the country (e.g., "Philadelphia, PA, USA"), while others omit the country (e.g., "Los Angeles, CA") or provide a more detailed state name without the country (e.g., "Ithaca, New York, USA"). This inconsistency suggests a flexible approach to specifying locations, reflecting how people might informally or formally address a place.

### Summary for Output Column Data:

The output data column provides a standardized format for the geographical locations associated with each educational institution from the input data. Each entry in the output column includes the city, state abbreviation, and, where missing from the input, the country ("USA") is appended to ensure consistency and clarity. This standardization process addresses the inconsistencies in the input data's second column, making the geographical information uniformly accessible and understandable.

### Relationship Summary:

The relationship between the input and output data columns demonstrates a process of standardization and clarification of geographical information associated with various educational institutions in the United States. The transformation from input to output involves maintaining the essential geographical details (city and state) while ensuring that each entry adheres to a consistent format by appending the country ("USA") where it is not originally specified. This process highlights the importance of uniformity in data presentation, especially for geographical locations, to facilitate clear and unambiguous communication. The output data serves as a refined version of the input's second column, optimized for clarity and consistency, without altering the inherent information about each institution's location., and input as ['University of Pennsylvania', 'Phialdelphia, PA, USA'] output is Phialdelphia, PA, USA, input as ['UCLA', 'Los Angeles, CA'] output is Los Angeles, CA, USA, input as ['Cornell University', 'Ithaca, New York, USA'] output is Ithaca, New York, USA, input as ['Penn', 'Philadelphia, PA, USA'] output is Philadelphia, PA, USA, input as ['University of Maryland College Park', 'College Park, MD'] output is College Park, MD, USA, input as ['University of Michigan', 'Ann Arbor, MI, USA'] output is Ann Arbor, MI, USA, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
