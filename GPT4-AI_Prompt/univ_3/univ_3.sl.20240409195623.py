Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Summary of Input Column Data:

The input data consists of two columns, with each row representing a specific university or college and its corresponding location. The first column contains the names of various higher education institutions, including a mix of full university names (e.g., "University of Pennsylvania", "Cornell University") and abbreviations or informal names (e.g., "UCLA", "Penn"). These institutions are located across different states in the USA, indicating a geographical diversity in the dataset.

The second column provides the location of each institution, typically in the format of "City, State" or "City, State, Country". However, there is some inconsistency in the presentation of the locations, as not all entries include the country ("USA"), and there are minor spelling errors (e.g., "Phialdelphia" instead of "Philadelphia"). Despite these inconsistencies, the locations are identifiable and correspond to the institutions listed in the first column.

### Summary of Output Column Data:

The output data is a cleaned and standardized version of the second column from the input data. It presents the locations of the various institutions in a consistent format, primarily focusing on correcting spelling errors and ensuring the inclusion of the country ("USA") when it is missing. This standardization process makes the data more uniform and easier to understand or analyze. The output retains the "City, State, USA" format for all entries, ensuring clarity and uniformity across the dataset.

### Relationship Between Input and Output:

The relationship between the input and output columns is a process of data cleaning and standardization. The output is derived directly from the second column of the input data, with modifications made to correct any inaccuracies, standardize the format, and ensure completeness. This process involves:

1. Correcting spelling errors in city names.
2. Adding the country ("USA") where it is missing to maintain consistency.
3. Retaining the original city and state information without alteration unless correcting spelling errors.

The goal of this transformation is to enhance the readability and usability of the location data associated with various universities and colleges in the USA. By standardizing the format and correcting errors, the output data becomes more reliable and easier to work with for any further analysis or application., and input as ['University of Pennsylvania', 'Phialdelphia, PA, USA'] output is Phialdelphia, PA, USA, input as ['UCLA', 'Los Angeles, CA'] output is Los Angeles, CA, USA, input as ['Cornell University', 'Ithaca, New York, USA'] output is Ithaca, New York, USA, input as ['Penn', 'Philadelphia, PA, USA'] output is Philadelphia, PA, USA, input as ['University of Maryland College Park', 'College Park, MD'] output is College Park, MD, USA, input as ['University of Michigan', 'Ann Arbor, MI, USA'] output is Ann Arbor, MI, USA, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
