Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Summary for Input Column Data:

The input data consists of two columns. The first column primarily contains strings that are a combination of fruit names followed by a series of digits, although there are instances where the string is just the fruit name without any digits. Examples include 'apples30', 'peaches24', 'peaches0', and 'pears'. The second column contains strings of digits, which seem to vary in value but do not directly correlate with the digits attached to the fruit names in the first column. Examples from the second column include '7', '8', and '6'.

### Summary for Output Column Data:

The output data consists of a single column that contains only the fruit names extracted from the first column of the input data. The digits, whether they are part of the fruit names in the first column or the entire content of the second column, are not included in the output. The output examples include 'apples', 'peaches', and 'pears'.

### Relationship Between Input and Output:

The relationship between the input and output data suggests a process of extracting only the alphabetical characters from the first column of the input, effectively removing any numerical characters that may be attached to the fruit names. The second column of the input data, which contains only numerical characters, does not appear to influence the output in any discernible way. The output is solely determined by the fruit names present in the first column of the input, indicating that the operation performed on the input data is focused on isolating and extracting the fruit names, disregarding any numerical data attached to these names or presented in the second column., and input as ['apples30', '7'] output is apples, input as ['peaches24', '8'] output is peaches, input as ['peaches0', '8'] output is peaches, input as ['pears', '6'] output is pears, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
