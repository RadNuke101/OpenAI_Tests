Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Input Column Summary:

The input data consists of two columns. The first column contains strings that are primarily names of fruits, possibly followed by a numeric value. The numeric value, when present, is directly attached to the fruit name without any separating character (e.g., "apples30", "peaches24"). In some cases, the fruit name might be followed by a '0' (e.g., "peaches0"), or it might not be followed by any numeric value at all (e.g., "pears"). The second column contains numeric values represented as strings (e.g., "7", "8", "6"). These numeric values do not directly correlate with the numeric values that might be attached to the fruit names in the first column.

### Output Column Summary:

The output data consists of a single column that contains only the names of fruits, with any numeric values removed. This suggests that the transformation from the input to the output involves extracting or isolating the fruit names from the first column of the input, disregarding any numeric values that may be attached to these names or presented in the second column.

### Relationship Summary:

The transformation from the input to the output demonstrates a clear relationship focused on isolating qualitative data (fruit names) from a mix of qualitative and quantitative data. The process involves:

1. **Extracting Fruit Names:** The primary operation is to identify and extract the names of fruits from the first column of the input data, regardless of whether these names are followed by numeric values or not. This indicates that the operation is not influenced by the presence or absence of numeric values attached to the fruit names.

2. **Ignoring Numeric Values:** Any numeric values, whether attached to the fruit names in the first column or present in the second column, are disregarded in the output. This shows that the transformation process is designed to filter out quantitative data, focusing solely on the qualitative aspect (fruit names).

3. **No Dependency on Second Column:** The transformation does not seem to depend on the values present in the second column of the input data, as these values do not influence the output. The process is solely concerned with the content of the first column, specifically the extraction of fruit names.

In summary, the relationship between the input and output data is characterized by the selective extraction of qualitative data (fruit names) from a dataset that also contains quantitative elements (numeric values). The operation effectively filters out the quantitative aspects, showcasing a focus on preserving or highlighting the qualitative information., and input as ['apples30', '7'] output is apples, input as ['peaches24', '8'] output is peaches, input as ['peaches0', '8'] output is peaches, input as ['pears', '6'] output is pears, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
