Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Summary for Input Column Data

The input data consists of two columns. The first column primarily contains strings that are a combination of fruit names and numbers, with the fruit names being consistent across different entries (e.g., apples, peaches, pears) and the numbers varying. In some cases, the string may consist solely of the fruit name without any accompanying numbers (e.g., pears). The second column contains numbers represented as strings. These numbers do not directly correlate with the numbers (if any) attached to the fruit names in the first column. The variability in the first column suggests a pattern where the fruit name is the key component of interest, while the numbers might represent a secondary attribute or a variable not directly influencing the output. The second column's numbers seem to be independent of the first column's content, suggesting they might play a different role or no significant role in determining the output.

### Summary for Output Column Data

The output data consists of the fruit names extracted from the first column of the input data, with all numerical values and other characters removed. This indicates a direct relationship between the first column of the input data and the output, where the output is derived by isolating the alphabetical characters (fruit names) from the first input column. The second column of the input data does not appear to influence the output, as the output solely consists of the fruit names without any numbers or reference to the values provided in the second input column.

### Relationship Summary Between Input and Output

The relationship between the input and output data is characterized by a process of extracting the fruit names from the first column of the input data, disregarding any numbers or other characters that may accompany these names. The second column of the input data does not influence the output, indicating that the process focuses solely on identifying and extracting the alphabetical components (fruit names) from the first column. This suggests that the primary function or algorithm applied to the input data involves text processing or string manipulation, specifically aimed at isolating and extracting the fruit names as the relevant output. The presence of numbers in the first column alongside the fruit names, and the presence of a separate column with numbers, do not affect the outcome, highlighting a selective extraction process based on the type of data (alphabetical vs. numerical) rather than the specific values or characters present., and input as ['apples30', '7'] output is apples, input as ['peaches24', '8'] output is peaches, input as ['peaches0', '8'] output is peaches, input as ['pears', '6'] output is pears, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
