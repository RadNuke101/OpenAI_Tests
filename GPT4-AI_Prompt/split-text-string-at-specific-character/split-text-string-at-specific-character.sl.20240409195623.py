Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Input Column Data Summary

The input data consists of two columns, each containing qualitative information:

1. **First Column**: This column contains strings that represent filenames with a specific format. Each filename starts with a six-digit date (in the format of DDMMYY), followed by an underscore, and then a descriptive name of the file. The file extension ".xlsx" indicates that these are Excel spreadsheet files. Examples include "011016_assignment.xlsx" and "030116_cost.xlsx".

2. **Second Column**: This column contains single-digit strings, either '1' or '2'. These digits appear to serve as indicators or commands that dictate what part of the filename from the first column should be extracted or focused on.

### Output Column Data Summary

The output data is derived from the combination of the two input columns. The output is contingent on the value provided in the second input column:

- When the second column's value is '1', the output extracts the date part (the first six digits) from the filename in the first column. For example, given "011016_assignment.xlsx" and '1', the output is "011016".
  
- When the second column's value is '2', the output extracts the descriptive name along with the file extension from the filename in the first column. For example, given "011016_assignment.xlsx" and '2', the output is "assignment.xlsx".

### Relationship Summary

The relationship between the input columns and the output column is a conditional extraction based on the indicator provided in the second input column. The process can be summarized as follows:

- **Indicator '1'**: Triggers the extraction of the date part from the filename. This indicates that the focus is on when the file was created or is referring to, isolating the temporal aspect of the data.
  
- **Indicator '2'**: Triggers the extraction of the descriptive name and file extension, focusing on the content or nature of the file rather than its temporal aspect.

This setup suggests a system designed to selectively parse filenames based on the need to either categorize files by date or by their content/type. It's a straightforward, yet effective method for handling file naming conventions that encode multiple pieces of information within a single string., and input as ['011016_assignment.xlsx', '1'] output is 011016, input as ['011016_assignment.xlsx', '2'] output is assignment.xlsx, input as ['030116_cost.xlsx', '1'] output is 030116, input as ['030116_cost.xlsx', '2'] output is cost.xlsx, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
