Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Input Column 1 Summary:

The first input column contains strings that represent filenames with a specific format. These filenames are composed of a date prefix (in the format DDMMYY), followed by an underscore, and then a descriptor of the file's content (e.g., "assignment", "cost"), ending with the file extension ".xlsx". This suggests that the files are Excel spreadsheets, likely related to assignments, costs, or other categorizable activities or data, with the date indicating when they were created, relevant to, or due.

### Input Column 2 Summary:

The second input column contains single-digit numerical strings, either '1' or '2'. This column appears to act as a selector or a mode indicator that determines what part of the filename from the first column is extracted and presented as output. Specifically, '1' seems to indicate that the output should be the date prefix of the filename, while '2' indicates that the output should be the descriptor of the file's content along with the file extension.

### Output Column Summary:

The output column contains strings that are either the date prefix (DDMMYY) extracted from the filenames in the first input column or the descriptor of the file's content along with the ".xlsx" extension. The content of the output is directly determined by the value in the second input column, with '1' leading to the extraction of the date prefix and '2' leading to the extraction of the file descriptor and extension.

### Relationship Summary:

The relationship between the input columns and the output column is a conditional extraction based on the value provided in the second input column. When the second input column contains '1', the output is the date prefix from the filename in the first input column. When the second input column contains '2', the output is the descriptor of the file's content along with the ".xlsx" extension from the first input column. This indicates a structured approach to parsing and extracting specific parts of a filename based on a given condition or mode, which could be useful for organizing, sorting, or categorizing files based on their dates or content types., and input as ['011016_assignment.xlsx', '1'] output is 011016, input as ['011016_assignment.xlsx', '2'] output is assignment.xlsx, input as ['030116_cost.xlsx', '1'] output is 030116, input as ['030116_cost.xlsx', '2'] output is cost.xlsx, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
