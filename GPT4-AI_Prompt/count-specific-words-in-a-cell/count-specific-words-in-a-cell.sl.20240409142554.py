Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Input Column Summary:

The input data consists of two columns. The first column contains sentences, while the second column contains specific substrings or words to be identified within the sentences from the first column. The sentences in the first column are fixed across the examples, with the sentence being "The fox jumped over the fox". This sentence is used to search for occurrences of the substrings provided in the second column. The substrings in the second column vary across the examples, including "fox", "ox", and "Fox". These substrings are the targets for which the occurrences within the sentence are counted.

### Output Column Summary:

The output data is a single column that represents the count of occurrences of the specified substring (from the second input column) within the sentence (from the first input column). The outputs for the given examples are numerical values that correspond to how many times the specified substring appears in the sentence. The provided examples result in outputs of 2, 2, and 0, corresponding to the substrings "fox", "ox", and "Fox", respectively.

### Relationship Summary:

The relationship between the input and output columns is a direct function of substring search within a given sentence. The output is determined by counting how many times the specified substring (second input column) appears within the sentence (first input column). This relationship highlights several key points:

1. **Case Sensitivity**: The search is case-sensitive, as evidenced by the difference in output when searching for "fox" versus "Fox". The lowercase "fox" is found twice, while the capitalized "Fox" yields a count of zero, indicating no occurrences.

2. **Substrings**: The search includes substrings within words, not just whole words. This is shown by the substring "ox" being found twice within the sentence, despite not being a standalone word but rather part of the word "fox".

3. **Exact Matches**: The output count is based on exact matches of the substring within the sentence. The count reflects the total number of times the exact sequence of characters in the substring appears in the sentence.

In summary, the relationship between the input columns and the output column is a demonstration of a case-sensitive, exact-match substring search within a sentence, where the output reflects the total occurrences of the specified substring., and input as ['The fox jumped over the fox', 'fox'] output is 2, input as ['The fox jumped over the fox', 'ox'] output is 2, input as ['The fox jumped over the fox', 'Fox'] output is 0, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
