Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Input Column Summary:

The input data consists of two columns. The first column contains sentences, and the second column specifies a substring to be searched within these sentences. The sentences provided in the examples are identical across the examples, specifically "The fox jumped over the fox". This sentence is structured to contain simple narrative content involving an animal (a fox) performing an action (jumping over another fox). The substrings provided for search vary in terms of their case sensitivity and the portion of the word they represent. These substrings include "fox", "ox", and "Fox", which target different aspects of case sensitivity and partial word matching within the search context.

### Output Column Summary:

The output data is a single column that represents the count of occurrences of the specified substring within the given sentence. The outputs provided in the examples are numerical values: 2, 2, and 0. These values directly correlate with the frequency of the specified substring's occurrence in the sentence. The variation in output values reflects the impact of case sensitivity and the specificity of the substring on the search results.

### Relationship Summary:

The relationship between the input and output columns demonstrates a straightforward pattern of substring search within a given sentence. The key factors influencing the output (the count of occurrences) are:

1. **Case Sensitivity**: The search for "fox" and "ox" yields counts of 2, indicating that the search is case-insensitive for these instances, as they match both occurrences of "fox" within the sentence regardless of case. However, the search for "Fox" results in a count of 0, highlighting that when the case does not match exactly, no occurrences are counted. This suggests that the search mechanism can be case-sensitive, depending on the specificity of the substring provided.

2. **Partial Matches**: The substring "ox", which is a part of the word "fox", also yields a count of 2. This indicates that the search mechanism is capable of identifying and counting occurrences of partial word matches within the sentence.

In summary, the relationship between the input data (sentences and specified substrings) and the output data (count of occurrences) is governed by the principles of substring search, with case sensitivity and the ability to match partial words playing significant roles in determining the outcome of the search., and input as ['The fox jumped over the fox', 'fox'] output is 2, input as ['The fox jumped over the fox', 'ox'] output is 2, input as ['The fox jumped over the fox', 'Fox'] output is 0, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
