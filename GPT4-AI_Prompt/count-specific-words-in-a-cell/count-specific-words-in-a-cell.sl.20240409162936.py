Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Input Column Summary:

The input data consists of two columns. The first column contains sentences, and the second column contains specific substrings or words to be identified within the sentences from the first column. The sentences provided as examples all include variations of the phrase "The fox jumped over the fox," which suggests a focus on the repetition of certain words, particularly "fox." The second column's values vary, including exact matches ("fox"), partial matches ("ox"), and case-sensitive mismatches ("Fox"). This setup indicates that the task involves searching for occurrences of the specified substrings or words within the given sentences, taking into account factors like exact matches and case sensitivity.

### Output Column Summary:

The output data is numerical, indicating the count of occurrences of the specified substring or word (from the second input column) within the sentence (from the first input column). The examples provided show outputs of 2, 2, and 0, corresponding to the counts of "fox," "ox," and "Fox" within the sentence "The fox jumped over the fox," respectively. This suggests that the output is directly related to how the search term from the second input column matches elements within the sentence from the first input column, with considerations for exact matches and case sensitivity.

### Relationship Summary:

The relationship between the input and output columns is a function of substring or word search within a given sentence. The output numerical value represents the count of occurrences of the specified search term within the sentence. This relationship is influenced by several factors:

1. **Exact Match:** The search term must exactly match the corresponding word or substring within the sentence for it to be counted, as seen in the counts for "fox" and "ox."
2. **Case Sensitivity:** The search is case-sensitive, as demonstrated by the difference in counts for "fox" (lowercase) and "Fox" (uppercase with the same letters), where the latter yields a count of 0 despite the presence of the word in the sentence.
3. **Partial Matches:** The search allows for partial matches, as indicated by the count for "ox" being 2, which is part of the word "fox" within the sentence.

In summary, the output is determined by how the search term from the second input column matches against the sentence in the first input column, with considerations for exact matching and case sensitivity playing crucial roles in determining the count of occurrences., and input as ['The fox jumped over the fox', 'fox'] output is 2, input as ['The fox jumped over the fox', 'ox'] output is 2, input as ['The fox jumped over the fox', 'Fox'] output is 0, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
