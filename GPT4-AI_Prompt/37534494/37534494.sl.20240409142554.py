Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Input Column Summary:

The input data consists of two primary components: statements and a keyword. The statements express a sentiment towards a specific fruit, either positive (e.g., "I love apples") or negative (e.g., "I hate bananas"). These statements are structured in a simple, straightforward manner, indicating a clear preference or aversion towards the mentioned fruit. The final component of the input is a keyword, which is a single word representing a fruit (e.g., "banana" or "apple"). This keyword does not contain any sentiment indication by itself but is crucial for determining the output based on the context provided by the preceding statements.

### Output Column Summary:

The output data is directly related to the input data, specifically the keyword provided as the last part of the input. The output selects a statement from the input that matches the sentiment towards the fruit mentioned in the keyword. If the keyword is "banana," the output is a statement from the input that expresses a sentiment about bananas (e.g., "I hate bananas"). Similarly, if the keyword is "apple," the output reflects the sentiment towards apples as expressed in the input (e.g., "I love apples"). The output is thus a reflection of the sentiment expressed towards the specific fruit mentioned in the keyword, indicating a direct relationship between the keyword and the sentiments expressed in the input statements.

### Relationship Summary:

The relationship between the input and output data is governed by the sentiment expressed towards the fruit mentioned in the keyword. The input provides a context of sentiments (love or hate) towards specific fruits, and the keyword acts as a selector that determines which of these sentiments is relevant for the output. The process involves matching the fruit mentioned in the keyword with the fruits mentioned in the input statements and selecting the statement that expresses a sentiment about that specific fruit. This mechanism highlights a clear, structured relationship where the output is a direct reflection of the sentiment towards the fruit identified by the keyword in the input data. This relationship underscores the importance of both the sentiment expressed in the statements and the selection role played by the keyword in determining the output., and input as ['I love apples', 'I hate bananas', 'banana'] output is I hate bananas, input as ['I love apples', 'I hate bananas', 'apple'] output is I love apples, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
