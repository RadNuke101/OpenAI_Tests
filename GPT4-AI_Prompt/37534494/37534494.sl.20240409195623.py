Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Input Column Summary:

The input data consists of two primary components: statements and a keyword. The first two elements in the input data are statements expressing a sentiment towards a specific fruit, either positive (love) or negative (hate). These statements are structured as "I [sentiment] [fruit]." The third element is a keyword, which is a single word representing a fruit. This keyword serves as a trigger or a filter to select one of the statements based on its relevance or association with the sentiments expressed in the statements.

### Output Column Summary:

The output data is a selection from the input statements, specifically chosen based on the relevance to the keyword provided in the input data. The output reflects a direct relationship with the keyword, showcasing a sentiment (either positive or negative) towards the fruit mentioned in the keyword. This selection process indicates a filtering mechanism that matches the keyword with the corresponding fruit mentioned in the statements and retrieves the statement that expresses a sentiment about that specific fruit.

### Relationship Summary:

The relationship between the input and output data is characterized by a filtering and matching process. The keyword in the input acts as a criterion to sift through the sentiment statements, selecting the one that matches the fruit mentioned in the keyword. This process demonstrates a conditional selection based on the relevance of the content in the statements to the keyword. The output is thus directly influenced by the keyword, as it determines which sentiment statement is selected based on the fruit it mentions. This relationship highlights the importance of the keyword in guiding the selection process, ensuring that the output reflects a sentiment that is specifically relevant to the keyword provided., and input as ['I love apples', 'I hate bananas', 'banana'] output is I hate bananas, input as ['I love apples', 'I hate bananas', 'apple'] output is I love apples, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
