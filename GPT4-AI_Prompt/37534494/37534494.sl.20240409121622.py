Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Input Column Summary:

The input data consists of two distinct parts: a list of statements and a single keyword. The statements express personal preferences towards certain fruits, specifically apples and bananas, using phrases like "I love" or "I hate." These preferences are explicitly stated, making it clear how the individual feels about each fruit. The final element in the input data is a keyword, which is a fruit name, either "apple" or "banana." This keyword does not contain any sentiment by itself but is crucial in determining the output based on the sentiments expressed in the preceding statements.

### Output Column Summary:

The output data is a single statement selected from the list of input statements. This selection is directly influenced by the keyword provided in the input data. The output reflects the sentiment (either positive or negative) associated with the keyword fruit. If the keyword is "apple," the output is a statement expressing sentiment about apples; if the keyword is "banana," the output is a statement expressing sentiment about bananas. The output is thus a direct reflection of the input keyword's match with the sentiments expressed in the input statements.

### Relationship Summary:

The relationship between the input and output data is governed by the keyword's match with the sentiments expressed in the input statements. The process involves filtering the input statements to find a match that corresponds with the keyword's sentiment and subject. This indicates a conditional selection mechanism where the keyword acts as a filter or a trigger to select the appropriate statement from the input list. The output is not random but is a calculated selection that aligns with the keyword provided, demonstrating a clear cause-and-effect relationship between the keyword in the input data and the statement in the output data. This mechanism showcases a basic form of sentiment analysis, where the sentiment towards a specific subject (in this case, a fruit) is identified and used to generate a relevant output., and input as ['I love apples', 'I hate bananas', 'banana'] output is I hate bananas, input as ['I love apples', 'I hate bananas', 'apple'] output is I love apples, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
