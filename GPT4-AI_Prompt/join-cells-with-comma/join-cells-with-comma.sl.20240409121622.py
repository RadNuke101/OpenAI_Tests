Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Input Column Summary:

The input column consists of lists of fruit names, which are qualitative data representing different types of fruits. Each list may contain a variable number of fruit names, and some lists may include empty strings indicating missing or unspecified fruit names. The fruit names are represented as strings, and there is no inherent order or hierarchy among the fruits listed within each input. The variety of fruits mentioned across the input lists suggests a diverse range of fruit types being considered.

### Output Column Summary:

The output column contains strings that are derived from the input lists of fruit names. Specifically, the output is a concatenation of the non-empty fruit names from the input lists, separated by commas. This transformation process effectively filters out any empty strings or unspecified fruit names from the input, resulting in a cleaner, more concise representation of the fruit names. The output maintains the original order of the fruit names as they appeared in the input, excluding the empty or unspecified entries.

### Relationship Summary:

The relationship between the input and output columns is characterized by a filtering and formatting process. The input lists, which may contain a mix of specified fruit names and empty strings, are processed to remove any empty or unspecified entries. The remaining fruit names are then concatenated into a single string, with commas serving as separators. This process preserves the original order of the fruit names from the input lists but presents them in a more compact and readable format in the output.

The transformation from input to output does not alter the nature of the data (i.e., the names of the fruits) but rather refines and restructures it for clarity and conciseness. This relationship highlights a data cleaning and formatting operation that is common in data processing tasks, where the goal is to extract and present the most relevant and meaningful information from a given dataset., and input as ['figs', '', 'apples'] output is figs, apples, input as ['mangos', 'kiwis', 'grapes'] output is mangos, kiwis, grapes, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
