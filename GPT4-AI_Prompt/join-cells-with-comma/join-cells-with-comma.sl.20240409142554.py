Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Input Column Summary:

The input column consists of lists of fruit names, which are qualitative data representing different types of fruits. Each list may vary in length and can include any fruit name, with the possibility of empty strings representing missing or unspecified fruit names. The data is categorical, with each entry representing a type of fruit. The variety of fruits mentioned across the input lists includes common fruits like apples, mangos, and grapes, as well as potentially less common ones like figs and kiwis. The presence of empty strings indicates that not all lists are fully populated with fruit names, suggesting variability in the completeness of the data provided.

### Output Column Summary:

The output column consists of strings that are derived from the input lists of fruit names. Each output is a concatenation of the non-empty fruit names from the corresponding input list, separated by commas. The transformation from input to output involves filtering out any empty strings (representing missing or unspecified fruits) and then joining the remaining fruit names into a single string. This process retains the order of fruit names as they appear in the input, ensuring that the output accurately reflects the sequence of fruits listed, minus any gaps or omissions.

### Relationship Summary:

The relationship between the input and output columns is a process of data cleaning and formatting. Specifically, the transformation involves two key steps: 
1. **Filtering:** Removing any empty strings from the input lists, which can be seen as a way of cleaning the data by eliminating missing or unspecified entries.
2. **Concatenation:** Joining the remaining fruit names into a single, comma-separated string, which formats the data into a more compact and readable form.

This process preserves the original order of the fruit names while ensuring that the output is free from gaps or omissions, making the data more presentable and easier to interpret. The relationship highlights a common data preprocessing task where raw or incomplete data is refined into a more usable format, maintaining the essence of the original information while improving its accessibility and readability., and input as ['figs', '', 'apples'] output is figs, apples, input as ['mangos', 'kiwis', 'grapes'] output is mangos, kiwis, grapes, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
