Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Input Column Summary:

The input column consists of lists of fruit names. These lists vary in length and can include any type of fruit, as well as empty strings which seem to represent missing or unspecified items. The fruits mentioned are diverse, ranging from common selections like apples and mangos to more specific choices like figs and kiwis. The presence of empty strings indicates that not every list is fully populated with fruit names, suggesting variability in the data completeness or the intention to signify a placeholder for data that could be either unknown or intentionally omitted.

### Output Column Summary:

The output column presents a concatenated string of the non-empty elements from the input lists, separated by commas. This transformation indicates a cleaning or preprocessing step where empty or null values are excluded from the final output. The output retains the order of the non-empty items as they appear in the input, maintaining the sequence of the fruit names. This process results in a more streamlined and readable format, suitable for applications where only the valid (non-empty) entries are of interest, such as in databases, displays, or further data processing tasks.

### Relationship Between Input and Output:

The relationship between the input and output data is characterized by a filtration and formatting process. Specifically, the transformation from input to output involves:

1. **Filtering:** Removing empty strings from the lists in the input column. This step cleans the data by excluding null or missing values, which are represented by empty strings in the context of this dataset.
2. **Formatting:** Converting the cleaned list of fruit names into a single, comma-separated string. This step enhances readability and makes the data more compact, facilitating its use in environments where a simple, clean list of terms is required.

This process suggests a focus on data cleaning and preparation, likely aimed at making the dataset more usable for subsequent analysis, reporting, or application development. The relationship underscores the importance of handling missing or irrelevant data (in this case, empty strings) and the utility of presenting the data in a format that is both accessible and easy to manipulate or query., and input as ['figs', '', 'apples'] output is figs, apples, input as ['mangos', 'kiwis', 'grapes'] output is mangos, kiwis, grapes, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
