Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Input Column Summary:

The input data consists of sentences or phrases that are statements or assertions. These sentences vary in their content, ranging from idiomatic expressions to informative statements. The variation in the input data includes numerical values presented in different formats (e.g., numeric digits vs. spelled out) and statements that might contain specific knowledge or advice. The diversity in the input data suggests that the analysis or processing applied to this data is focused on the interpretation or evaluation of the content based on certain criteria, which could be related to the format, meaning, or the presence of specific elements within the sentences.

### Output Column Summary:

The output data is binary, represented as true or false values. These values seem to be determined based on a specific criterion or set of criteria applied to the input sentences. The binary nature of the output suggests a classification or evaluation process where the input data is assessed against certain rules or conditions, leading to a decision that categorizes each input as either meeting the criteria (true) or not meeting the criteria (false).

### Relationship Between Input and Output:

The relationship between the input and output data appears to be governed by how the information within each input sentence adheres to specific criteria or rules. One observable pattern is the representation of numerical information within the sentences. For instance, when numbers are presented in numeric form ('2') rather than spelled out ('two'), the output tends to be true, suggesting that one of the criteria for the output being true might be related to the format of numerical representation. However, this pattern does not uniformly apply across all examples, indicating that there might be additional criteria at play, such as the context of the statement or the presence of certain keywords or phrases.

The evaluation process leading to the output seems to involve a nuanced analysis of the input sentences, where both the literal and possibly the figurative meaning of the sentences are considered. This implies that the criteria for determining the output are not solely based on surface-level features but also involve an interpretation of the content and context of each input sentence.

In summary, the relationship between the input and output data is characterized by a complex evaluation process where the input sentences are analyzed based on specific criteria, which may include the format of numerical information, the context of the statements, and possibly other factors not immediately evident from the provided examples. This process results in a binary classification that reflects whether each input sentence meets the established criteria., and input as ['A bird in the hand is worth 2 in the bush.'] output is true, input as ['A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush.'] output is false, input as ['The 15 shortcuts you simply must know'] output is true, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
