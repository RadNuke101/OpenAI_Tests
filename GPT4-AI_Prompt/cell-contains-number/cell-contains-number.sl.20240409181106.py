Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Input Column Summary:

The input data consists of textual statements or phrases that vary in their content and structure. These statements can be idiomatic expressions, as seen with "A bird in the hand is worth 2 in the bush." or "A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush.", or they can be informative statements like "The 15 shortcuts you simply must know". The variation in the input data suggests a focus on the use of numbers (whether spelled out or in numeral form) within the context of the statement. The input data showcases a mix of common sayings and potentially informative or instructional content, indicating a diversity in the type of text being analyzed.

### Output Column Summary:

The output data is binary, represented by boolean values true or false. These values are determined based on certain criteria applied to the input text. The criteria for determining the output seem to revolve around the specific representation of numbers within the text, whether they are spelled out as words or presented as numerals.

### Relationship Between Input and Output:

The relationship between the input and output data hinges on the representation of numbers within the input text. When numbers are presented as numerals (e.g., "2" in "A bird in the hand is worth 2 in the bush." or "15" in "The 15 shortcuts you simply must know"), the output is true. Conversely, when numbers are spelled out as words (e.g., "two" in "A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush."), the output is false. This pattern suggests that the determining factor for the output value is whether numbers within the text are explicitly stated as numerals rather than spelled out. This criterion for output determination highlights a specific interest in the numerical representation within textual data and its impact on the classification or analysis of the text., and input as ['A bird in the hand is worth 2 in the bush.'] output is true, input as ['A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush.'] output is false, input as ['The 15 shortcuts you simply must know'] output is true, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
