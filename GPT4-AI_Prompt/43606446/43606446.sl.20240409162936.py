Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Input Column Summary:

The input data consists of strings that represent financial instrument identifiers, specifically currency pairs, along with a trading platform and the nature of the transaction. Each string is structured in a specific format that includes multiple components separated by dots and angle brackets. The general format can be described as follows:

- **Base Currency.Target Currency**<**Trading Platform**, **Transaction Type**, **Settlement Currency**>

The components are:
1. **Base Currency**: The currency from which the conversion starts.
2. **Target Currency**: The currency to which the conversion is aimed.
3. **Trading Platform**: The platform where the trade is executed, e.g., IDEALPRO.
4. **Transaction Type**: The nature of the transaction, typically CASH.
5. **Settlement Currency**: The currency in which the transaction is settled.

Examples from the data include 'USD.EUR<IDEALPRO,CASH,EUR>' and 'KOR.JPN<IDEALPRO,CASH,YEN>', indicating trades from USD to EUR and KOR to JPN, respectively, on the IDEALPRO platform, both as cash transactions, with settlements in EUR and YEN.

### Output Column Summary:

The output data consists of currency codes, which represent the settlement currency for each transaction described in the input data. The settlement currency is the final currency that is used to settle the transaction. It is extracted from the input string, indicating the currency in which the transaction's financial obligations are finalized.

Examples of output data include 'EUR', 'USD', 'WON', and 'YEN', corresponding to the settlement currencies for the transactions described in the input data.

### Relationship Summary:

The relationship between the input and output data is direct and extractive. The output, which is the settlement currency, is directly extracted from the input string. Specifically, the settlement currency is the last component of the input string, encapsulated within the angle brackets. This indicates that the output is not determined through a transformation or calculation but rather through the extraction of a specific piece of information from the structured input data.

The process to derive the output from the input involves parsing the input string to identify and extract the settlement currency component. This relationship highlights the structured nature of the input data and the importance of the settlement currency in financial transactions, as it determines the currency in which the trade is ultimately settled., and input as ['USD.EUR<IDEALPRO,CASH,EUR>'] output is EUR, input as ['USD.EUR<IDEALPRO,CASH,USD>'] output is USD, input as ['KOR.JPN<IDEALPRO,CASH,WON>'] output is WON, input as ['KOR.JPN<IDEALPRO,CASH,YEN>'] output is YEN, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
