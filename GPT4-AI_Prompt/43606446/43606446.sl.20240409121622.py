Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Input Column Summary:

The input data consists of strings that follow a specific format, which can be broken down into several components:

1. **Currency Pair**: The beginning of each string starts with a currency pair, denoted by three-letter currency codes separated by a dot (e.g., "USD.EUR" for US Dollar to Euro). This indicates the currencies involved in the transaction or exchange rate query.

2. **Exchange Type**: Following the currency pair, there is an identifier within angle brackets that starts with the exchange type, "IDEALPRO" in all provided examples. This suggests that the transactions or queries are intended for a specific type of financial exchange platform or service.

3. **Transaction Type**: The next component within the angle brackets is "CASH," indicating the nature of the transaction or the asset type involved. In this context, it specifies that the operation concerns cash transactions as opposed to derivatives or other financial instruments.

4. **Base Currency**: The final part within the angle brackets is a three-letter currency code (e.g., "EUR," "USD," "WON," "YEN"). This specifies the base currency for the transaction or query, which is the currency in which the transaction is denominated or the currency of interest in the exchange rate query.

### Output Column Summary:

The output data consists of three-letter currency codes (e.g., "EUR," "USD," "WON," "YEN"). These codes represent the base currency in the context of the transaction or query as specified in the input data. The output directly corresponds to the last component of the input string within the angle brackets.

### Relationship Summary:

The relationship between the input and output data is straightforward: the output is determined by the last component of the input string, which specifies the base currency for the transaction or query. This base currency is the focus of the exchange rate or transaction in question, and it is extracted directly from the input to serve as the output. The rest of the input data provides context about the currency pair involved, the type of exchange or transaction, and the nature of the asset (cash), but it is the base currency component that directly determines the output., and input as ['USD.EUR<IDEALPRO,CASH,EUR>'] output is EUR, input as ['USD.EUR<IDEALPRO,CASH,USD>'] output is USD, input as ['KOR.JPN<IDEALPRO,CASH,WON>'] output is WON, input as ['KOR.JPN<IDEALPRO,CASH,YEN>'] output is YEN, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
