Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Input Column Summary:

The input data consists of strings that follow a structured format, encapsulating multiple pieces of information related to financial transactions or currency exchange information. Each string is divided into segments separated by periods (.) and angle brackets (< >), with the following general structure:

1. **Currency Pair**: The initial segment before the first period (e.g., USD.EUR, KOR.JPN) represents a currency pair involved in the transaction. This pair indicates the base currency and the target currency for the exchange.
   
2. **Exchange Type and Nature**: Following the currency pair, enclosed within angle brackets, are details about the exchange type and the nature of the transaction. This typically includes an exchange platform or method (e.g., IDEALPRO), the transaction type (e.g., CASH), and the currency of interest or settlement currency (e.g., EUR, USD, WON, YEN).

### Output Column Summary:

The output data consists of currency codes (e.g., EUR, USD, WON, YEN) extracted from the input strings. These codes represent the currency of interest or the settlement currency for the transaction described in the input. Each output is directly related to the last segment of the input string, indicating the specific currency that is the focus of the exchange or transaction.

### Relationship Summary:

The relationship between the input and output data is straightforward and follows a consistent pattern. The output currency code is always derived from the last segment of the input string, which is enclosed within angle brackets. This segment specifies the currency of interest or the settlement currency in the context of the currency exchange or financial transaction described. The input provides a detailed description of the transaction, including the currency pair involved, the exchange platform or method, and the nature of the transaction, while the output succinctly identifies the currency that is the focal point of the transaction. This relationship allows for the extraction of specific, targeted information (the settlement currency) from a more complex dataset (the full transaction description)., and input as ['USD.EUR<IDEALPRO,CASH,EUR>'] output is EUR, input as ['USD.EUR<IDEALPRO,CASH,USD>'] output is USD, input as ['KOR.JPN<IDEALPRO,CASH,WON>'] output is WON, input as ['KOR.JPN<IDEALPRO,CASH,YEN>'] output is YEN, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
