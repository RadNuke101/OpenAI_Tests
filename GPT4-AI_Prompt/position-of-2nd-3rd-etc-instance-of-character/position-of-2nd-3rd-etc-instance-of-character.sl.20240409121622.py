Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Summary for Input Columns:

#### Column 1: Patterns or Strings
- **Description**: This column contains strings that are composed of alphanumeric characters and special symbols. The strings appear to follow a pattern where multiple elements are concatenated using a specific delimiter (e.g., 'x' in '100x15x50', '-' in 'cat-in-the-hat').
- **Variability**: The content varies from numeric sequences to alphabetic words, suggesting a wide range of possible applications or contexts.
- **Commonality**: The common feature among the entries is the presence of a delimiter that separates different segments within the string.

#### Column 2: Delimiter
- **Description**: This column specifies the delimiter used in the corresponding string from Column 1. It is a single character that appears within the string to separate different segments or elements.
- **Consistency**: Each entry in this column is consistent with its role as a delimiter in the corresponding entry of Column 1.

#### Column 3: Position or Occurrence
- **Description**: This column contains numeric values that seem to represent a specific position or the occurrence of a segment within the string from Column 1, based on the delimiter specified in Column 2.
- **Range**: The values are integers, indicating a count or an ordinal position.

### Summary for Output Column:

#### Output: Resultant Value
- **Description**: The output values are integers that represent a result derived from applying some operation to the inputs.
- **Pattern**: The output seems to be related to the manipulation or analysis of the string in Column 1, considering the delimiter from Column 2 and the position/occurrence value from Column 3.

### Relationship Summary:

The relationship between the input columns and the output column appears to be a function that processes the string from Column 1 by utilizing the delimiter specified in Column 2 and the position or occurrence value from Column 3 to produce a numeric result captured in the output column. The process likely involves counting or identifying segments within the string, delimited by the specified character, and then applying the position/occurrence value in some manner to derive the final output.

For instance, in the given examples:
- The operation on '100x15x50' with delimiter 'x' and a position value of '2' results in '7', which might imply a calculation or extraction based on these inputs.
- Similarly, 'cat-in-the-hat' with '-' and '3' leading to '11' suggests a process that considers the segments within the string, delimited by '-', and uses the numeric input to calculate or determine the output.

The exact nature of the operation is not specified, but it is clear that the output is a function of the structured manipulation of the input string, guided by the specified delimiter and the numeric value indicating position or occurrence., and input as ['100x15x50', 'x', '2'] output is 7, input as ['cat-in-the-hat', '-', '3'] output is 11, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
