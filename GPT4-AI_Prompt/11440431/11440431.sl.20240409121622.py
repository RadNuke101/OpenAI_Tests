Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Input Column Summary:

The input column consists of strings that describe various types of economic activities or industries, often followed by a geographical identifier (such as a country abbreviation). These activities range from agriculture (e.g., "Soybean Farming") to resource extraction (e.g., "Mining", "Oil Extraction") and food production (e.g., "Fishing"). The geographical identifiers, when present, specify the location where these activities are primarily taking place, such as "US" for the United States and "CAN" for Canada. However, not all entries include a geographical identifier, indicating that some activities are considered without a specific regional focus.

### Output Column Summary:

The output column simplifies the input data by focusing solely on the type of economic activity or industry, removing any geographical identifiers if they were present. This results in a more generalized classification of the activities, such as "Mining", "Soybean Farming", "Oil Extraction", and "Fishing". The output emphasizes the nature of the economic activity itself, without specifying where it is conducted, making the information applicable to a broader context.

### Relationship Between Input and Output:

The transformation from the input to the output column represents a process of abstraction and generalization. The key operation in this process is the removal of geographical identifiers, which shifts the focus from specific instances of economic activities in particular locations to the general nature of these activities. This suggests that the purpose of the output is to categorize or classify the economic activities in a way that is independent of their geographical context. This could be useful for analyses or applications where the type of activity is more relevant than its location, or where data needs to be aggregated across different regions without bias towards any specific area. The relationship between the input and output columns highlights the importance of understanding economic activities at both specific and general levels, depending on the analytical or operational goals., and input as ['Mining US'] output is Mining, input as ['Soybean Farming CAN'] output is Soybean Farming, input as ['Soybean Farming'] output is Soybean Farming, input as ['Oil Extraction US'] output is Oil Extraction, input as ['Fishing'] output is Fishing, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
