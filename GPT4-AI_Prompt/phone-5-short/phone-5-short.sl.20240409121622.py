Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Summary of Input Column Data

The input data consists of strings that represent phone numbers in an international format. Each string begins with a '+' sign, followed by the country code, a space, and then the phone number itself which is divided into three groups by hyphens. The country codes vary in length, ranging from one to three digits. The phone numbers are consistently formatted but their prefixes (the parts before the hyphens) do not follow a specific pattern that correlates with the country code or its length. The input data is qualitative as it represents categories of phone numbers based on their country codes rather than quantitative measurements.

### Summary of Output Column Data

The output data extracts and presents the country code from each phone number in the input column as an integer. This transformation from the input to the output strips away the '+' sign and the rest of the phone number, focusing solely on the country code. The output is numerical but should still be considered qualitative in this context because it categorizes each phone number by its country code rather than representing a measurable quantity.

### Relationship Between Input and Output

The relationship between the input and output data is a direct extraction process where the output isolates and presents the country code from the input phone number. This process simplifies the input data from a detailed phone number to a categorization based on the country code. The transformation highlights the significance of the country code as a key identifier within the input data, effectively categorizing the phone numbers by their geographical or regional association. This relationship underscores the importance of the country code in understanding or organizing the input data, turning a complex string into a simpler, categorical identifier., and input as ['+106 769-858-438'] output is 106, input as ['+83 973-757-831'] output is 83, input as ['+62 647-787-775'] output is 62, input as ['+172 027-507-632'] output is 172, input as ['+72 001-050-856'] output is 72, input as ['+95 310-537-401'] output is 95, input as ['+6 775-969-238'] output is 6, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
