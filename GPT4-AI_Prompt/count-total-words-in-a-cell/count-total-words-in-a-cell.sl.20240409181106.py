Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Summary for Input Column Data:

The input data consists of fragments of sentences or phrases, which appear to be extracted from a narrative or a story. Each entry in the input column is a string of text that varies in length and structure. The phrases provided as examples include:

1. A simple naming or identification of characters or objects, as seen with 'humpty dumpty'.
2. A more complex sentence structure that describes an action or a scene, such as 'humpty dumpty sat on a wall,'
3. A narrative continuation or an outcome of an event, exemplified by 'couldnt put humpty together again.'

These inputs seem to be parts of a larger context or story, likely derived from the well-known nursery rhyme "Humpty Dumpty". The variations in the input data suggest that the data set could include a wide range of linguistic structures, from simple noun phrases to more complex sentences involving actions and outcomes.

### Summary for Output Column Data:

The output data consists of numerical values that correspond to each input string. The numbers provided in the examples are 2, 6, and 5. These numbers represent a count or a measurement related to the corresponding input text. Given the context of the examples, it is reasonable to infer that the output values represent the count of words in each input string.

### Relationship Summary:

The relationship between the input and output data is a direct correlation between the textual content of the input and a numerical representation of a specific characteristic of that text in the output. Specifically, the output value for each input string appears to be the count of words contained within that string. This relationship indicates a straightforward processing task where the input text is analyzed to determine the number of words it contains, and this count is then provided as the output.

This analysis suggests that the primary function of the data set and its processing is to perform word count operations on fragments of text. The choice of text fragments from the "Humpty Dumpty" nursery rhyme for the examples further implies that the data set might be used for educational, linguistic, or text analysis purposes, focusing on basic text processing tasks such as word counting., and input as ['humpty dumpty'] output is 2, input as ['humpty dumpty sat on a wall,'] output is 6, input as ['couldnt put humpty together again.'] output is 5, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
