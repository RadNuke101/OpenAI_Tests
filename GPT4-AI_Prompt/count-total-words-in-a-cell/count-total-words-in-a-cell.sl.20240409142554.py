Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Summary for Input Column Data

The input data consists of strings, each representing a fragment of text. These fragments vary in length and complexity, ranging from simple phrases like "humpty dumpty" to more complex sentences that include punctuation, such as "humpty dumpty sat on a wall,". The content of the input data appears to be derived from the well-known nursery rhyme about Humpty Dumpty, with each fragment capturing a different part of the story. The variation in the input data suggests an exploration of how different types of textual inputs, specifically in terms of length and structure, might be analyzed or processed.

### Summary for Output Column Data

The output data consists of integers that correspond to each input string. These integers range from 2 to 6 in the provided examples. The relationship between the input and output data suggests that the output represents a count of some element within the input text. Given the context and the examples provided, it is reasonable to infer that the output numbers represent the count of words in each input string. This indicates a direct relationship between the complexity or length of the input text and the numerical value of the output.

### Relationship Summary between Input and Output

The relationship between the input and output data can be summarized as a word count operation. The output integer for each input string represents the total number of words contained within that string. This relationship is consistent across the provided examples, indicating a straightforward processing task where the input text is analyzed to determine the number of words it contains. The process seems to ignore punctuation as a factor in the word count, focusing solely on the words themselves. This relationship showcases a basic yet fundamental text analysis operation, highlighting how textual data can be quantified in terms of its word content., and input as ['humpty dumpty'] output is 2, input as ['humpty dumpty sat on a wall,'] output is 6, input as ['couldnt put humpty together again.'] output is 5, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
