Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Input Column Summary:

The input data consists of a series of strings that combine a brand name with a numerical value. The brands represented in the data include Ducati, Honda, Acura, and Ferrari. These brands are followed by a numerical value that varies across entries but includes values such as 100, 125, 250, and 550. The numerical values are directly appended to the brand names without any space or delimiter, forming a single string for each entry.

### Output Column Summary:

The output data extracts and presents only the brand name component from each input string, disregarding the numerical values. The output for each input string is the brand name itself, which includes Ducati, Honda, Acura, and Ferrari, corresponding directly to the brand component of the input strings.

### Relationship Summary:

The relationship between the input and output data is a process of extracting the brand name from a combined string of brand name and numerical value. The output is derived by isolating and removing the numerical portion of the input string, leaving only the brand name. This process is consistent across all entries, indicating a systematic method of parsing the input strings to extract only the textual brand name component, irrespective of the numerical value attached to it in the input. The numerical values in the input do not influence the output beyond their role in being part of the input string to be processed and removed., and input as ['Ducati100'] output is Ducati, input as ['Honda125'] output is Honda, input as ['Ducati250'] output is Ducati, input as ['Honda250'] output is Honda, input as ['Honda550'] output is Honda, input as ['Ducati125'] output is Ducati, input as ['Acura100'] output is Acura, input as ['Acura125'] output is Acura, input as ['Ferrari250'] output is Ferrari, input as ['Ferrari250'] output is Ferrari, input as ['Honda550'] output is Honda, input as ['Ducati125'] output is Ducati, input as ['Ducati100'] output is Ducati, input as ['Honda125'] output is Honda, input as ['Ducati250'] output is Ducati, input as ['Honda250'] output is Honda, input as ['Honda550'] output is Honda, input as ['Ducati125'] output is Ducati, input as ['Acura100'] output is Acura, input as ['Acura125'] output is Acura, input as ['Ferrari250'] output is Ferrari, input as ['Ferrari250'] output is Ferrari, input as ['Honda550'] output is Honda, input as ['Ducati125'] output is Ducati, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
