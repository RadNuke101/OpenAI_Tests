Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: ### Input Column Summary:

The input data consists of a series of strings that combine a brand name with a numerical value, without any spaces between them. The brands mentioned in the dataset include Ducati, Honda, Acura, and Ferrari. The numerical values attached to these brand names vary and include 100, 125, 250, and 550. These strings seem to follow a consistent pattern where the brand name comes first, followed directly by the numerical value. The dataset includes repetitions for certain brand and number combinations, indicating that the same type of entry can occur multiple times.

### Output Column Summary:

The output data for each input string is the brand name extracted from the corresponding input string, without the numerical value. The output includes the names Ducati, Honda, Acura, and Ferrari, which directly correlate with the brand names present in the input data. There is a one-to-one relationship between the input and the output, where the output is consistently the brand component of the input string, irrespective of the numerical value attached to it in the input.

### Relationship Summary:

The relationship between the input and output data is straightforward and consistent: the output is derived by extracting the brand name portion from the input string, effectively removing the numerical value that follows the brand name in the input. This process is applied uniformly across all entries in the dataset, indicating a clear pattern of extracting textual (brand name) information from a mixed format string (brand name + numerical value). The numerical values in the input do not influence the output; they are simply discarded as part of the extraction process. This relationship suggests that the primary focus is on categorizing or identifying the brand component of the input data, without regard to the specific numerical values that are also present in the input strings., and input as ['Ducati100'] output is Ducati, input as ['Honda125'] output is Honda, input as ['Ducati250'] output is Ducati, input as ['Honda250'] output is Honda, input as ['Honda550'] output is Honda, input as ['Ducati125'] output is Ducati, input as ['Acura100'] output is Acura, input as ['Acura125'] output is Acura, input as ['Ferrari250'] output is Ferrari, input as ['Ferrari250'] output is Ferrari, input as ['Honda550'] output is Honda, input as ['Ducati125'] output is Ducati, input as ['Ducati100'] output is Ducati, input as ['Honda125'] output is Honda, input as ['Ducati250'] output is Ducati, input as ['Honda250'] output is Honda, input as ['Honda550'] output is Honda, input as ['Ducati125'] output is Ducati, input as ['Acura100'] output is Acura, input as ['Acura125'] output is Acura, input as ['Ferrari250'] output is Ferrari, input as ['Ferrari250'] output is Ferrari, input as ['Honda550'] output is Honda, input as ['Ducati125'] output is Ducati, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
