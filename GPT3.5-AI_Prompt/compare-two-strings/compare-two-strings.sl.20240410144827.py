Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Summary for Input Column Data:
- The input column data consists of fruit names, with some names being repeated with different capitalization.
- The data is qualitative in nature, representing different types of fruits.

Summary for Output Column Data:
- The output column data consists of boolean values (true or false) indicating whether the input fruit names are the same regardless of capitalization.
- The output is based on a comparison of the input fruit names, with true indicating a match and false indicating a mismatch.

Relationship between Input and Output:
- The relationship between the input and output is based on comparing the fruit names in the input column to determine if they are the same regardless of capitalization.
- The output column reflects the result of this comparison, with true indicating a match and false indicating a mismatch.
- The output is dependent on the input data and the comparison logic applied to it., and input as ['apple', 'apple'] output is true, input as ['orange', 'Orange'] output is false, input as ['peach', 'peach'] output is true, input as ['cherry', 'cherrY'] output is false, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.

    input_str1_lower = input_str1.lower()

    # Check if the lowercase input strings are the same
    if input_str1_lower == input_str2_lower:
        return True
    else:
        return False

# Test cases
print(generated_function('apple', 'apple'))  # Output: True
