Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Summary for Input Column Data:
- The input column data consists of qualitative phrases or words such as "The quick brown fox," "quick brown fox," and "fox."

Summary for Output Column Data:
- The output column data consists of the first word from each input phrase or word, such as "The," "quick," and an empty space for the last input.

Relationship between Input and Output:
- The output column data seems to be extracting the first word from each input phrase or word. The relationship between the input and output is that the output column displays the first word from each input, regardless of the length or complexity of the input phrase., and input as ['The quick brown fox.'] output is The, input as ['quick brown fox.'] output is quick, input as ['fox'] output is , , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.

    # Initialize an empty list to store the output
    output = []
    
    # Iterate through each input argument
    for arg in args:
        # Split the input argument by whitespace and get the first word
        first_word = arg.split()[0]
        # Append the first word to the output list
        output.append(first_word)
    
    # Return the output list as a string
    return ' '.join(output)

# Test cases
print(generated_function('The quick brown fox.'))
print(generated_function('quick brown fox.'))
print(generated_function('fox.'))

print(generated_function("quick brown fox."))  ## Output: quick
