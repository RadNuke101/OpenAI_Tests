Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Summary for Input Column 1:
- The input column 1 contains a mix of values starting with either a letter or a letter followed by a number.
- There is a variation in the length of the values in input column 1.
- The values in input column 1 do not follow a specific pattern or format.

Summary for Input Column 2:
- The input column 2 contains values that are all three-letter words.
- The values in input column 2 are consistent in length and format.

Summary for Output Column:
- The output column contains values that are either the same as the first value in input column 1 or the same as the values in input column 2.
- The output value seems to be selected based on a specific rule or condition related to the values in input column 1.
- The relationship between the input and output columns appears to be based on the presence or absence of specific patterns or characters in the values of input column 1., and input as ['C0abc', 'def'] output is C0abc, input as ['aabc', 'def'] output is def, input as ['C0dd', 'qwe'] output is C0dd, input as ['dd', 'qwe'] output is qwe, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
