Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Input Column 1 Summary: The input column contains two statements expressing feelings towards fruits, with one positive and one negative sentiment.

Input Column 2 Summary: The input column contains a single fruit mentioned, 'banana'.

Output Column Summary: The output column contains the statement "I hate bananas".

Relationship Summary: The output column seems to be directly related to the presence of the word 'banana' in the input column. When the word 'banana' is present in the input, the output expresses a negative sentiment towards it. This suggests a direct relationship between the input data and the output, where the sentiment expressed in the output is determined by the specific fruit mentioned in the input., and input as ['I love apples', 'I hate bananas', 'banana'] output is I hate bananas, input as ['I love apples', 'I hate bananas', 'apple'] output is I love apples, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
