Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Input Column Summaries:
1. The input column contains phrases expressing feelings towards specific fruits, such as "I love apples" and "I hate bananas".
2. The input column also includes individual fruit names like "banana".

Output Column Summary:
The output column contains a specific phrase from the input column that matches the fruit mentioned in the output. For example, if the output is "banana", the corresponding input phrase is "I hate bananas".

Relationship Summary:
The relationship between the input and output columns is that the output column displays a phrase from the input column that matches the fruit mentioned in the output. The input column provides various expressions of feelings towards different fruits, and the output column selects the corresponding phrase based on the fruit mentioned. This relationship helps to identify the specific sentiment associated with a particular fruit mentioned in the output., and input as ['I love apples', 'I hate bananas', 'banana'] output is I hate bananas, input as ['I love apples', 'I hate bananas', 'apple'] output is I love apples, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
