Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: For the input column data, it appears to consist of date ranges in different formats ('MM/DD/YY-MM/DD/YY' or 'MM/DD/YYYY-MM/DD/YYYY') followed by a number indicating either the start date or end date of the range. The input data seems to be related to dates and selecting a specific date within the range.

As for the output column, it consistently shows a single date extracted from the date range provided in the input. The output date corresponds to the date specified by the number in the input column, either the start or end date of the range.

The relationship between the input and output columns is that the output date is derived from the date range specified in the input column based on the number provided. The output date represents either the start or end date of the range, as indicated by the number in the input. This relationship suggests a process of selecting a specific date from a given date range based on the input number., and input as ['1/17/16-1/18/17', '1'] output is 1/17/16, input as ['1/17/16-1/18/17', '2'] output is 1/18/17, input as ['01/17/2016-01/18/2017', '1'] output is 01/17/2016, input as ['01/17/2016-01/18/2017', '2'] output is 01/18/2017, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
