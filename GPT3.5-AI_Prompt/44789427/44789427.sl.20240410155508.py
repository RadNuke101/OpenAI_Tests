Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Summary for Input Column 1:
- The input column 1 contains date ranges in the format of MM/DD/YY-MM/DD/YY or MM/DD/YYYY-MM/DD/YYYY.
- The dates in the input column are formatted differently, with some dates having leading zeros and others not.

Summary for Input Column 2:
- The input column 2 contains numbers that correspond to the start or end date in the date range provided in column 1.
- The numbers in the input column are all single digits.

Summary for Output Column:
- The output column contains the specific date from the date range provided in column 1 based on the number in column 2.
- The output column displays the date in the same format as it appears in the input column, maintaining consistency.

Relationship between Input and Output:
- The output column is directly related to the input columns, with the number in column 2 determining whether the start or end date from the date range in column 1 is displayed.
- The output column serves as a reference point to extract specific dates from the date ranges provided in the input columns.
- The input columns provide the context for the output column, allowing for the extraction of relevant information based on the given number., and input as ['1/17/16-1/18/17', '1'] output is 1/17/16, input as ['1/17/16-1/18/17', '2'] output is 1/18/17, input as ['01/17/2016-01/18/2017', '1'] output is 01/17/2016, input as ['01/17/2016-01/18/2017', '2'] output is 01/18/2017, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
