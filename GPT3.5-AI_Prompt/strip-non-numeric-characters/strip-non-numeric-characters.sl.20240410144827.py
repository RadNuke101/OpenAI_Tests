Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Summary for Input Column Data:
- The input column data consists of qualitative descriptions such as "100 apples", "the price is %500 dollars", and "serial number %003399".

Summary for Output Column Data:
- The output column data consists of numerical values extracted from the input column data, such as 100, 500, and 003399.

Relationship between Input and Output:
- The input column data contains qualitative descriptions that include numerical values, which are then extracted and converted into the output column data. The relationship between the input and output is that the numerical values mentioned in the input are extracted and presented as the output., and input as ['100 apples'] output is 100, input as ['the price is %500 dollars'] output is 500, input as ['serial number %003399'] output is 003399, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.

# Define the generated function
def generated_function(input_str):
    # Extract numerical value from input string
    output_str = ''.join(filter(str.isdigit, input_str))
    
    return output_str

# Test cases
print(generated_function("100 apples"))
print(generated_function("the price is %500 dollars"))
print(generated_function("serial number %003399"))
print(generated_function("100 apples"))  ## Output: 100
print(generated_function("the price is %500 dollars"))  ## Output: 500
print(generated_function("serial number %003399"))  ## Output: 003399
