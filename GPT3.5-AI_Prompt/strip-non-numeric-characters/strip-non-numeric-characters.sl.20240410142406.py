Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Summary for Input Column Data:
- The input column data consists of phrases or sentences containing numerical values embedded within them, such as '100 apples', 'the price is %500 dollars', and 'serial number %003399'. These values are not presented in a consistent format across all inputs.

Summary for Output Column Data:
- The output column data consists of extracted numerical values from the input column data, such as 100, 500, and 003399. These values represent the quantitative information hidden within the qualitative input data.

Relationship between Input and Output:
- The relationship between the input and output columns is that the output column extracts and presents the numerical values found within the qualitative input data. The output column serves as a way to convert the qualitative information into quantitative data, providing a clearer and more concise representation of the original input., and input as ['100 apples'] output is 100, input as ['the price is %500 dollars'] output is 500, input as ['serial number %003399'] output is 003399, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.

# Define the generated function
def generated_function(input_str):
    # Extract numerical values from the input string
    output = ''.join(filter(str.isdigit, input_str))
    
    return output

# Test cases
input1 = '100 apples'
input2 = 'the price is %500 dollars'
input3 = 'serial number %003399'

# Call the generated function with test inputs
output1 = generated_function(input1)
output2 = generated_function(input2)
output3 = generated_function(input3)
print(generated_function("100 apples"))  ## Output: 100
print(generated_function("the price is %500 dollars"))  ## Output: 500
print(generated_function("serial number %003399"))  ## Output: 003399
