Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Summary for Input Column 1:
The input column consists of strings containing placeholders for usernames. The strings vary in length and content, but they all follow a similar pattern of including the placeholder "_username" or "_example" multiple times.

Summary for Input Column 2:
The input column consists of specific usernames that are being searched for within the strings in column 1. Each row contains a different username to search for.

Summary for Output Column:
The output column contains the count of how many times the username from Input Column 2 appears in the corresponding string from Input Column 1. The values in this column range from 1 to 3, depending on how many times the username appears in the string.

Relationship between Input and Output:
The relationship between the input columns and the output column is that the output column value represents the frequency of the username from Input Column 2 appearing in the corresponding string from Input Column 1. The more times the username appears in the string, the higher the output value. This relationship allows for easy identification of how many times a specific username occurs in a given string., and input as ['An example string with _username in it RT _AwesomeUser says _username is awesome', 'username'] output is 2, input as ['An example string with _username in it RT _AwesomeUser says _username is awesome', 'AwesomeUser'] output is 1, input as ['An _example string with _example in it is awesome _example', 'example'] output is 3, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
