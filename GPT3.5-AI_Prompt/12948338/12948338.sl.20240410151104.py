Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Summary for Input Column Data:
1. In the first input column, the phrase "_username" appears twice in the given string.
2. In the second input column, the phrase "_AwesomeUser" appears once in the given string.
3. In the third input column, the phrase "_example" appears three times in the given string.

Summary for Output Column Data:
1. The output column data shows the count of how many times the specified username appears in the corresponding input string.

Relationship between Input and Output:
The output column provides the count of occurrences of the specified username in each input string. The summaries of the input column data show the frequency of different usernames in the input strings. The relationship between the input and output is that the output count corresponds to the number of times the specified username appears in each input string., and input as ['An example string with _username in it RT _AwesomeUser says _username is awesome', 'username'] output is 2, input as ['An example string with _username in it RT _AwesomeUser says _username is awesome', 'AwesomeUser'] output is 1, input as ['An _example string with _example in it is awesome _example', 'example'] output is 3, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.

print(generated_function("An _example string with _example in it is awesome _example", "example"))  ## Output: 3
