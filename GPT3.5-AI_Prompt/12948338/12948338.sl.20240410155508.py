Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Input Column 1 Summary: The first column contains strings with placeholders for usernames. The strings vary in length and content, but they all have a similar structure with the placeholder "_username" appearing multiple times.

Input Column 2 Summary: The second column contains specific usernames that are used as placeholders in the strings in the first column. Each input has a different username, and the usernames may or may not appear in the corresponding string in column 1.

Output Column Summary: The output column contains numerical values that represent the number of times the username from column 2 appears in the corresponding string in column 1. The values range from 1 to 3, indicating the frequency of the username in each string.

Relationship Summary: The relationship between the input columns and the output column is that the numerical value in the output column reflects how many times the specific username from column 2 appears in the corresponding string in column 1. The more times the username appears in the string, the higher the numerical value in the output column. This relationship allows for a quantitative measure of the presence of the username in each string, providing insight into its frequency and relevance in the context of the string., and input as ['An example string with _username in it RT _AwesomeUser says _username is awesome', 'username'] output is 2, input as ['An example string with _username in it RT _AwesomeUser says _username is awesome', 'AwesomeUser'] output is 1, input as ['An _example string with _example in it is awesome _example', 'example'] output is 3, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
