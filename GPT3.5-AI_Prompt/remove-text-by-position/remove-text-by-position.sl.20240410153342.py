Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Summary for Input Column Data:
- The input column data consists of file paths in the format 'c=/users/dave/filename.xls'.
- Each input represents a specific file located in the user's directory.

Summary for Output Column Data:
- The output column data consists of the filenames extracted from the input paths.
- The output column contains the extracted filenames such as 'shotcut.xls', 'formulas.xls', and 'pivot table.xls'.

Relationship between Input and Output:
- The input column provides the full file paths, while the output column displays only the filenames extracted from those paths.
- The relationship between the input and output is that the output column represents the specific files mentioned in the input paths.
- By extracting the filenames, the output column simplifies the information provided in the input paths, making it easier to identify and reference specific files., and input as ['c=/users/dave/shotcut.xls'] output is shotcut.xls, input as ['c=/users/dave/formulas.xls'] output is formulas.xls, input as ['c=/users/dave/pivot table.xls'] output is pivot table.xls, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
