Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Summary for Input Column Data:
1. The input column data consists of file paths in the format 'c=/users/dave/filename.xls'.
2. Each input represents a specific file path related to a file named in the format 'filename.xls'.
3. The input data is qualitative in nature, representing different file names within the 'dave' directory.

Summary for Output Column Data:
1. The output column data consists of the extracted file names from the input file paths.
2. Each output represents the file name extracted from the corresponding input file path.
3. The output data is qualitative, representing the specific file names extracted from the input paths.

Relationship between Input and Output:
1. The relationship between the input and output is that the output column contains the extracted file names from the input file paths.
2. The output is directly derived from the input by extracting the file names mentioned after the last '/' in each input path.
3. The input and output are related in that the output is a subset of the input, specifically representing the file names mentioned in the input paths.
4. The output provides a simplified and focused representation of the file names present in the input paths, making it easier to identify and work with specific files., and input as ['c=/users/dave/shotcut.xls'] output is shotcut.xls, input as ['c=/users/dave/formulas.xls'] output is formulas.xls, input as ['c=/users/dave/pivot table.xls'] output is pivot table.xls, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
