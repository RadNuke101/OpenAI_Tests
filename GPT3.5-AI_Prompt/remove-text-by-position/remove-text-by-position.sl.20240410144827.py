Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Summary for input column data:
1. ['c=/users/dave/shotcut.xls']: The input data is related to a file named shotcut.xls.
2. ['c=/users/dave/formulas.xls']: The input data is related to a file named formulas.xls.
3. ['c=/users/dave/pivot table.xls']: The input data is related to a file named pivot table.xls.

Summary for output column data:
1. The output column data consists of the file names extracted from the input column data, which are shotcut.xls, formulas.xls, and pivot table.xls.

Relationship between input and output:
The input column data contains information about file paths, specifically the location of Excel files. The output column data consists of the file names extracted from the input column data. Therefore, the relationship between the input and output is that the output column provides a simplified version of the file names extracted from the input column data, making it easier to identify and reference the Excel files., and input as ['c=/users/dave/shotcut.xls'] output is shotcut.xls, input as ['c=/users/dave/formulas.xls'] output is formulas.xls, input as ['c=/users/dave/pivot table.xls'] output is pivot table.xls, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.

# Define the generated function
def generated_function(input_str):
    # Extract the file name from the input string
    file_name = input_str.split('/')[-1].replace('.xls', '')
    
    # Return the extracted file name
    return file_name

# Test cases
print(generated_function('c=/users/dave/shotcut.xls'))  # Output: shotcut
print(generated_function('c=/users/dave/formulas.xls'))  # Output: formulas

print(generated_function("c=/users/dave/shotcut.xls"))  ## Output: shotcut.xls
print(generated_function("c=/users/dave/formulas.xls"))  ## Output: formulas.xls
print(generated_function("c=/users/dave/pivot table.xls"))  ## Output: pivot table.xls
