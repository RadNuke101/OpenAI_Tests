Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Summary for Input Column Data:
1. ['some project,other project'] - Both projects are mentioned in the input.
2. ['some project'] - Only one project is mentioned in the input.
3. ['overhead'] - Only the term "overhead" is mentioned in the input.
4. ['some project, overhead'] - Both a project and the term "overhead" are mentioned in the input.
5. ['some project, other, boo'] - Multiple projects and additional terms are mentioned in the input.

Summary for Output Column Data:
- True: The output is true for inputs where projects are mentioned, either singularly or in combination with other terms.
- False: The output is false for inputs where only non-project terms are mentioned, such as "overhead".

Relationship Summary:
The output seems to be true when project-related terms are present in the input. The presence of project names or related terms appears to influence the output to be true, while inputs that do not contain project-related terms result in a false output. This suggests that the output is dependent on the presence of project references in the input data., and input as ['some project,other project'] output is true, input as ['some project'] output is true, input as ['overhead'] output is false, input as ['some project, overhead'] output is false, input as ['some project, other, boo'] output is true, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
