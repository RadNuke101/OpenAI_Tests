Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Summary for Input Column Data:
1. ['some project,other project']: Both projects are related and present in the input.
2. ['some project']: Only one project is mentioned in the input.
3. ['overhead']: The term "overhead" is mentioned in the input.
4. ['some project, overhead']: Both "some project" and "overhead" are mentioned in the input.
5. ['some project, other, boo']: Multiple projects and additional terms are mentioned in the input.

Summary for Output Column Data:
1. True: The output is true for the inputs where projects are mentioned.
2. False: The output is false for the inputs where only "overhead" is mentioned.

Relationship between Input and Output:
The output is true when the input includes project names, regardless of additional terms. The output is false when the input only includes the term "overhead" without any project names. This suggests that the presence of project names in the input is a determining factor for the output to be true., and input as ['some project,other project'] output is true, input as ['some project'] output is true, input as ['overhead'] output is false, input as ['some project, overhead'] output is false, input as ['some project, other, boo'] output is true, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
