Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Summary for Input Column 1:
The first input column contains a list of fruits, including figs and apples.

Summary for Input Column 2:
The second input column is empty.

Summary for Input Column 3:
The third input column contains a list of fruits, including apples.

Summary for Output Column:
The output column contains a combination of fruits from the input columns, such as figs, apples, mangos, kiwis, and grapes.

Relationship between Input and Output:
The output column combines fruits from all input columns, ensuring that all unique fruits are included in the final list. The output reflects a compilation of fruits from the input columns, creating a comprehensive list of fruits., and input as ['figs', '', 'apples'] output is figs, apples, input as ['mangos', 'kiwis', 'grapes'] output is mangos, kiwis, grapes, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.

# Test cases
print(generated_function('figs, , apples'))  # Output: figs, apples
