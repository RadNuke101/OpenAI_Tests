Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Input Column Data Summary:
- The input column data consists of the names of various universities or educational institutions along with their locations.
- Each entry in the input column data includes the name of the institution followed by the city, state, and country where it is located.
- The entries in the input column data vary in length and format, with some including additional information such as the abbreviation of the institution.

Output Column Data Summary:
- The output column data consists of the names of the universities or educational institutions along with their locations, followed by the country (USA).
- Each entry in the output column data is a combination of the name of the institution, the city, state, and country where it is located.
- The output column data follows a consistent format of institution name, city, state, and country for each entry.

Relationship between Input and Output:
- The relationship between the input and output columns is that the input column data provides the name and location of various universities or educational institutions, while the output column data presents the same information with the addition of the country (USA) at the end.
- The output column data is derived from the input column data by appending the country (USA) to each entry.
- The output column data serves as a standardized representation of the input column data, ensuring consistency in the format and providing a clear indication of the country where each institution is located., and input as ['University of Pennsylvania', 'Phialdelphia, PA, USA'] output is University of Pennsylvania, Phialdelphia, PA, USA, input as ['UCLA', 'Los Angeles, CA'] output is UCLA, Los Angeles, CA, USA, input as ['Cornell University', 'Ithaca, New York, USA'] output is Cornell University, Ithaca, New York, USA, input as ['Penn', 'Philadelphia, PA, USA'] output is Penn, Philadelphia, PA, USA, input as ['University of Maryland College Park', 'College Park, MD'] output is University of Maryland College Park, College Park, MD, USA, input as ['University of Michigan', 'Ann Arbor, MI, USA'] output is University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
