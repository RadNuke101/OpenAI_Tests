Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Summary for input column data:
- The input column data consists of names of universities or colleges along with their locations.
- Each entry includes the name of the institution followed by the city, state, and country (if applicable).

Summary for output column data:
- The output column data combines the name of the institution with its location in a standardized format.
- The output includes the name of the institution followed by the city, state, and country (if applicable), separated by commas.

Relationship between input and output:
- The input data provides the name and location of various universities or colleges.
- The output data standardizes the format by combining the name and location of each institution with commas separating the different components.
- The relationship between the input and output is that the output transforms the input data into a consistent and easily readable format for each entry., and input as ['University of Pennsylvania', 'Phialdelphia, PA, USA'] output is University of Pennsylvania, Phialdelphia, PA, USA, input as ['UCLA', 'Los Angeles, CA'] output is UCLA, Los Angeles, CA, USA, input as ['Cornell University', 'Ithaca, New York, USA'] output is Cornell University, Ithaca, New York, USA, input as ['Penn', 'Philadelphia, PA, USA'] output is Penn, Philadelphia, PA, USA, input as ['University of Maryland College Park', 'College Park, MD'] output is University of Maryland College Park, College Park, MD, USA, input as ['University of Michigan', 'Ann Arbor, MI, USA'] output is University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
