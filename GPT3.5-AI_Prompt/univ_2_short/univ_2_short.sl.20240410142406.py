Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Summary for Input Column Data:
- The input column data consists of the names of various universities or educational institutions along with their locations.
- Each entry includes the name of the institution followed by the city, state, and country (if applicable) where it is located.
- The input data is qualitative in nature, providing information about the names and locations of different educational institutions.

Summary for Output Column Data:
- The output column data consists of the names of universities or educational institutions along with their locations, similar to the input data.
- The output includes the name of the institution followed by the city, state, and country (if applicable) where it is located, with the addition of "USA" at the end of each entry.
- The output data is a combination of the input data with the country "USA" appended to each location.

Relationship between Input and Output:
- The relationship between the input and output columns is that the output is a modified version of the input data, with the addition of "USA" to each location.
- The input data provides the names and locations of various educational institutions, while the output data includes the same information with the country "USA" specified for each location.
- The output column serves as a standardized format for presenting the names and locations of educational institutions, ensuring consistency in the representation of their locations., and input as ['University of Pennsylvania', 'Phialdelphia, PA, USA'] output is University of Pennsylvania, Phialdelphia, PA, USA, input as ['UCLA', 'Los Angeles, CA'] output is UCLA, Los Angeles, CA, USA, input as ['Cornell University', 'Ithaca, New York, USA'] output is Cornell University, Ithaca, New York, USA, input as ['Penn', 'Philadelphia, PA, USA'] output is Penn, Philadelphia, PA, USA, input as ['University of Maryland College Park', 'College Park, MD'] output is University of Maryland College Park, College Park, MD, USA, input as ['University of Michigan', 'Ann Arbor, MI, USA'] output is University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
