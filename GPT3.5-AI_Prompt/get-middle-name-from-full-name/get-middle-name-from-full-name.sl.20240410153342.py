Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Summary for Input Column Data:
- The input column data consists of full names in the format of first name, middle name/initial, last name.

Summary for Output Column:
- The output column consists of the middle name or initial extracted from the input names.

Relationship between Input and Output:
- The output column extracts the middle name or initial from the input names, if present. If there is no middle name or initial in the input, the output is left blank. This relationship helps in identifying and isolating the middle names or initials from the full names provided in the input column., and input as ['susan ann chang'] output is ann, input as ['ayako tanaka'] output is , input as ['bobby t. smith'] output is t., input as ['anthory r. tom brown'] output is r. tom, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.

        if len(names) == 3:

            output.append('')
        else:
            output.append(names[1] + '.')
    return output

# Test cases
