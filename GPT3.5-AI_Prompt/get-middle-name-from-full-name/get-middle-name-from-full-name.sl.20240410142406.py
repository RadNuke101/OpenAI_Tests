Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Summary for Input Column Data:
- The input column data consists of full names in the format of first name, middle name/initial, last name.
- The names provided in the input column data are diverse and represent individuals from different backgrounds.

Summary for Output Column Data:
- The output column data consists of middle names or initials extracted from the full names in the input column data.
- The output column data varies in length, with some entries having a middle name or initial and others not having one.

Relationship between Input and Output:
- The output column data specifically focuses on extracting and displaying the middle names or initials from the full names provided in the input column data.
- The output column serves as a way to isolate and highlight the middle names or initials present in the input data, providing a more concise representation of the names.
- The relationship between the input and output columns showcases the process of extracting specific information (middle names or initials) from a larger set of qualitative data (full names)., and input as ['susan ann chang'] output is ann, input as ['ayako tanaka'] output is , input as ['bobby t. smith'] output is t., input as ['anthory r. tom brown'] output is r. tom, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.

# Define the generated function

    output = []
    for name in args:
        # Split the full name into parts
        parts = name.split()
        # Check if there is a middle name/initial
        if len(parts) == 3:
            output.append(parts[1])
        elif len(parts) == 2:
            output.append('')
        else:
            output.append(parts[1] + '.')
    return output

# Test cases
print(generated_function('susan ann chang'))  # Output: ['ann']
print(generated_function('ayako tanaka'))  # Output: ['']
print(generated_function('bobby t. smith'))  # Output: ['t.']
print(generated_function('anthory r. tom brown'))  # Output: ['r.']
print(generated_function("susan ann chang"))  ## Output: ann
print(generated_function("ayako tanaka"))  ## Output: 
print(generated_function("bobby t. smith"))  ## Output: t.
print(generated_function("anthory r. tom brown"))  ## Output: r. tom
