Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Summary for Input Column Data:
- The input column data consists of full names in the format of first name, middle name/initial, last name.
- The names provided in the input column data are diverse and vary in length and structure.

Summary for Output Column Data:
- The output column data consists of middle names or initials extracted from the input column data.
- In some cases, there may not be a middle name or initial present in the input data, resulting in an empty output.

Relationship between Input and Output:
- The relationship between the input and output is that the output column extracts and displays the middle names or initials from the input column data.
- If a middle name or initial is present in the input data, it is extracted and displayed in the output.
- The output column serves as a way to isolate and highlight the middle names or initials from the full names provided in the input column data., and input as ['susan ann chang'] output is ann, input as ['ayako tanaka'] output is , input as ['bobby t. smith'] output is t., input as ['anthory r. tom brown'] output is r. tom, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.

# Define the generated function

    for name in args:
        # Split the full name into parts
        parts = name.split()
        # Check if there is a middle name or initial
        if len(parts) > 2:
            output.append(parts[1])
        else:
            output.append('')
    return ', '.join(output)

# Test cases
