Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Summary for Input Column Data:
- The input column data consists of phrases describing different scenes or objects.
- The phrases contain colors (yellow, green) and objects (dog) as key elements.
- The phrases vary in terms of the arrangement of colors and objects within the scene.

Summary for Output Column Data:
- The output column data consists of boolean values indicating whether the given input phrase meets certain criteria.
- The criteria involve the presence of specific colors (yellow, green) and objects (dog) in the input tradition.
- The output is 'true' if the input phrase contains all three elements (yellow, green, dog) and 'false' otherwise.

Relationship between Input and Output:
- The relationship between the input and output is based on the presence or absence of specific colors (yellow, green) and objects (dog) in the input phrases.
- The output is determined by whether the input depends on the fulfillment of the criteria set by the input column data.
- The output serves as a filter to identify phrases that contain all three elements (yellow, green, dog) and distinguish them from those that do not., and input as ['yellow dog on green grass', 'yellow', 'green', 'dog'] output is true, input as ['Lone dog with a green frisbie on yellow sand', 'yellow', 'green', 'dog'] output is true, input as ['A yellow sun in a green field', 'yellow', 'green', 'dog'] output is false, input as ['yellow neon sign with a green background', 'yellow', 'green', 'dog'] output is false, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.

# Define the generated function
def generated_function(input_str, color1, color2, object_str):
    # Check if all three elements are present in the input string
    if color1 in input_str and color2 in input_str and object_str in input_str:
        return True
    else:
        return False

# Test cases
print(generated_function('yellow dog on green grass', 'yellow', 'green', 'dog')) # Output: True
print(generated_function('Lone dog with a green frisbie on yellow sand', 'yellow', 'green', 'dog')) # Output: True
print(generated_function('A yellow sun in a green field', 'yellow', 'green', 'dog')) # Output: False
print(generated_function('yellow neon sign with a green background', 'yellow', 'green', 'dog')) # Output: False
print(generated_function("yellow dog on green grass", "yellow", "green", "dog"))  ## Output: true
print(generated_function("Lone dog with a green frisbie on yellow sand", "yellow", "green", "dog"))  ## Output: true
print(generated_function("A yellow sun in a green field", "yellow", "green", "dog"))  ## Output: false
print(generated_function("yellow neon sign with a green background", "yellow", "green", "dog"))  ## Output: false
