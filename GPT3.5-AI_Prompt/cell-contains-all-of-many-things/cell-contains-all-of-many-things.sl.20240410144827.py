Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Summary for Input Column Data:
- The input column data consists of descriptions of different scenes involving colors (yellow, green) and objects (dog). 
- The descriptions vary in terms of the arrangement of colors and objects within the scene.

Summary for Output Column Data:
- The output column data consists of boolean values indicating whether the input description meets certain criteria (true or false).

Relationship between Input and Output:
- The output column value is true when the input description contains all three elements (yellow, green, dog) in any order or arrangement.
- The output column value is false when the input description does not contain all three elements or if the elements are not present in the specified order.
- The relationship between the input and output is based on the presence or absence of specific elements within the input descriptions., and input as ['yellow dog on green grass', 'yellow', 'green', 'dog'] output is true, input as ['Lone dog with a green frisbie on yellow sand', 'yellow', 'green', 'dog'] output is true, input as ['A yellow sun in a green field', 'yellow', 'green', 'dog'] output is false, input as ['yellow neon sign with a green background', 'yellow', 'green', 'dog'] output is false, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
