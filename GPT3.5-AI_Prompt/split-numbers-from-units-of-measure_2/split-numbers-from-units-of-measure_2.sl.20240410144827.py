Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Summary for Input Column Data:
- The input column data consists of different units of measurement such as 'v' for volts, 'hrs' for hours, 'h' for hours, and 'm' for meters.

Summary for Output Column Data:
- The output column data consists of the units of measurement that are extracted from the input column data, such as 'v', 'hrs', 'h', and 'm'.

Relationship between Input and Output:
- The output column data represents the units of measurement that are present in the input column data. The relationship between the input and output is that the output column data is derived from the input column data by extracting the units of measurement present in each input value., and input as ['80v', '3'] output is v, input as ['10hrs', '3'] output is hrs, input as ['7h', '2'] output is h, input as ['500m', '4'] output is m, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.

# Define the generated function

    # Extract the unit of measurement from the input string
    output = input_str[-1]
    
    return output

# Test cases
print(generated_function('80v')) # Output: v
print(generated_function('10hrs')) # Output: hrs
print(generated_function('7h')) # Output: h
print(generated_function('500m')) # Output: m
print(generated_function("80v", "3"))  ## Output: v
print(generated_function("10hrs", "3"))  ## Output: hrs
print(generated_function("7h", "2"))  ## Output: h
print(generated_function("500m", "4"))  ## Output: m
