Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Summary for Input Column Data:
- The input column data consists of units of measurement such as 'v', 'hrs', 'h', and 'm'.
- Each entry in the input column data is followed by a numerical value indicating a quantity or measurement.

Summary for Output Column Data:
- The output column data consists of units of measurement such as 'v', 'hrs', 'h', and 'm'.
- Each entry in the output column data represents the unit of measurement corresponding to the input quantity.

Relationship between Input and Output:
- The relationship between the input and output is that the output column data represents the units of measurement for the corresponding input quantities.
- The output column provides a reference for the type of measurement being described in the input column data.
- The input and output columns work together to provide a complete description of the quantities and units being referenced in the dataset., and input as ['80v', '3'] output is v, input as ['10hrs', '3'] output is hrs, input as ['7h', '2'] output is h, input as ['500m', '4'] output is m, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.

# Define the generated function
def generated_function(input_str, quantity):
    # Extract the unit of measurement from the input string
    unit = input_str[-1]

    # Return the unit of measurement as the output
    return unit

# Test cases
print(generated_function('80v', '3'))  # Output: v
print(generated_function('10hrs', '3'))  # Output: hrs
print(generated_function('7h', '2'))  # Output: h
print(generated_function('500m', '4'))  # Output: m
print(generated_function("80v", "3"))  ## Output: v
print(generated_function("10hrs", "3"))  ## Output: hrs
print(generated_function("7h", "2"))  ## Output: h
print(generated_function("500m", "4"))  ## Output: m
