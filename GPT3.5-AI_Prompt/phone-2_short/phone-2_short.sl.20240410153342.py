Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: For the input columns, the data consists of phone numbers in the format XXX-XXX-XXX. Each input column represents a different phone number. The numbers in the input columns do not follow any specific pattern or relationship between them.

As for the output column, it represents the last three digits of each phone number. The output column shows that the last three digits of each phone number vary and do not follow a specific pattern or relationship with the input columns.

In summary, the input columns contain qualitative data in the form of phone numbers, while the output column represents the last three digits of each phone number. There is no apparent relationship or pattern between the input columns and the output column., and input as ['938-242-504'] output is 504, input as ['308-916-545'] output is 545, input as ['623-599-749'] output is 749, input as ['981-424-843'] output is 843, input as ['118-980-214'] output is 214, input as ['244-655-094'] output is 094, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
