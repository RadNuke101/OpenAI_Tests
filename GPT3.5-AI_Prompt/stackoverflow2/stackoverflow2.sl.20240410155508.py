Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Summary for Input Column Data:
- The input column data consists of countries: India, China, Japan, Indonesia, and Korea.

Summary for Output Column:
- The output column consists of countries: India, China, and Indonesia.

Relationship between Input and Output:
- The output column includes countries that are present in the input column data. Specifically, the output column includes India and China, which are part of the input data ['india china japan'], and Indonesia, which is part of the input data ['indonesia korea']. The output column seems to be a subset of the input column data, focusing on specific countries mentioned in the input., and input as ['india china japan'] output is india china, input as ['indonesia korea'] output is indonesia, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.

# Define the generated function
def generated_function(input_str):
    # Split the input string into individual country names
    countries = input_str.split()
    
    # Check if India is in the input countries
    if 'india' in countries:
        # Check if China is in the input countries
        if 'china' in countries:
            # Return India and China as the output
            return 'India China'
        # If China is not in the input countries, return India as the output
        else:
            return 'India'
    # Check if Indonesia is in the input countries
    elif 'indonesia' in countries:
        # Return Indonesia as the output
        return 'Indonesia'
    # If none of the specific countries are in the input, return an empty string
    else:
        return ''

# Test cases
print(generated_function('india china japan')) # Output: India China
print(generated_function('indonesia korea')) # Output: Indonesia
print(generated_function("india china japan"))  ## Output: india china
print(generated_function("indonesia korea"))  ## Output: indonesia
