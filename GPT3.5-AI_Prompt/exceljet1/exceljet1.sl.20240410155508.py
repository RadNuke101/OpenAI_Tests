Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Summary for Input Column 1:
The input column 1 contains full names of individuals.

Summary for Input Column 2:
The input column 2 contains email addresses with domain names.

Summary for Output Column:
The output column contains the domain names extracted from the email addresses in input column 2.

Relationship between Input and Output:
The output column consists of the domain names extracted from the email addresses provided in input column 2. The relationship between the input and output is that the output column represents the domain names associated with the email addresses of the individuals listed in input column 1. The output column provides a simplified version of the email domain names, removing the username and '@' symbol., and input as ['ann chang', 'achang_maaker.com'] output is maaker.com, input as ['bobby smith', 'bobt_sphynx.uk.co'] output is sphynx.uk.co, input as ['art lennox', 'art.lennox_svxn.com'] output is svxn.com, input as ['smith bagshaw', 'smith_bbbbb.com'] output is bbbbb.com, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.

# Define the generated function
def generated_function(full_name, email_address):
    # Split the email address to extract the domain name
    domain_name = email_address.split('@')[1]
    return domain_name

# Test cases
print(generated_function('ann chang', 'achang@maaker.com'))
print(generated_function('bobby smith', 'bobt_sphynx@uk.co'))
print(generated_function('art lennox', 'art.lennox@svxn.com'))
print(generated_function('smith bagshaw', 'smith_bbbbb@com'))
print(generated_function("ann chang", "achang_maaker.com"))  ## Output: maaker.com
print(generated_function("bobby smith", "bobt_sphynx.uk.co"))  ## Output: sphynx.uk.co
print(generated_function("art lennox", "art.lennox_svxn.com"))  ## Output: svxn.com
print(generated_function("smith bagshaw", "smith_bbbbb.com"))  ## Output: bbbbb.com
