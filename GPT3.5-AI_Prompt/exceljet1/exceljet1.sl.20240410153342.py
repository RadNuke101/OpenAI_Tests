Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Summary for Input Column Data:
- The input column data consists of two parts: a person's name and an email domain.
- The names appear to be a combination of first and last names.
- The email domains vary in length and structure, with some including underscores and periods.

Summary for Output Column Data:
- The output column data consists of the domain names extracted from the email addresses in the input column.
- The domain names are a mix of different lengths and structures, including combinations of letters and periods.

Relationship between Input and Output:
- The output column data is derived from the email domains in the input column data.
- The output column provides the domain names after extracting them from the email addresses.
- There is a clear relationship between the input email addresses and the output domain names, with the output being a subset of the input., and input as ['ann chang', 'achang_maaker.com'] output is maaker.com, input as ['bobby smith', 'bobt_sphynx.uk.co'] output is sphynx.uk.co, input as ['art lennox', 'art.lennox_svxn.com'] output is svxn.com, input as ['smith bagshaw', 'smith_bbbbb.com'] output is bbbbb.com, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.

# Define the generated function
def generated_function(name, email_domain):
    # Split the email address to extract the domain
    domain = email_domain.split('_')[-1].split('.')[-1]
    
    return domain

# Test cases
print(generated_function('ann chang', 'achang_maaker.com'))
print(generated_function('bobby smith', 'bobt_sphynx.uk.co'))
print(generated_function('art lennox', 'art.lennox_svxn.com'))
print(generated_function('smith bagshaw', 'smith_bbbbb.com'))
print(generated_function("ann chang", "achang_maaker.com"))  ## Output: maaker.com
print(generated_function("bobby smith", "bobt_sphynx.uk.co"))  ## Output: sphynx.uk.co
print(generated_function("art lennox", "art.lennox_svxn.com"))  ## Output: svxn.com
print(generated_function("smith bagshaw", "smith_bbbbb.com"))  ## Output: bbbbb.com
