Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Summary for input column data:
- The input column data consists of qualitative values represented as strings.
- Each value in the input column data represents a unique input.

Summary for output column data:
- The output column data consists of numerical values.
- Each value in the output column represents the corresponding input value converted to a numerical format.

Relationship between input and output:
- The input values are qualitative representations of numbers.
- The output values are the numerical representations of the input values.
- The relationship between the input and output is a conversion process where qualitative input values are transformed into numerical output values.
- The output values directly correspond to the input values, with no additional calculations or transformations involved., and input as ['101'] output is 101, input as ['1002'] output is 1002, input as ['743'] output is 743, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.

# Define the generated function
def generated_function(input_str):
    # Convert the input string to numerical format and return it
    return int(input_str)

# Test cases
print(generated_function('101'))  # Output: 101
print(generated_function('1002'))  # Output: 1002
print(generated_function('743'))  # Output: 743
print(generated_function("101"))  ## Output: 101
print(generated_function("1002"))  ## Output: 1002
print(generated_function("743"))  ## Output: 743
