Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Summary for Input Column Data:
- The input column data consists of qualitative values represented as strings.
- The values in the input column data are unique and do not follow a specific pattern or sequence.

Summary for Output Column Data:
- The output column data consists of numerical values.
- The output column data corresponds directly to the input column data, with each input value being transformed into a numerical output value.

Relationship between Input and Output:
- The input column data serves as the basis for generating the output column data.
- Each unique input value is directly translated into a numerical output value without any apparent transformation or calculation.
- The relationship between the input and output is one-to-one, with each input value having a corresponding output value.
- The output values directly reflect the input values without any additional processing or manipulation., and input as ['101'] output is 101, input as ['1002'] output is 1002, input as ['743'] output is 743, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.

# Define the generated function
def generated_function(input_str):
    # Convert the input string to integer and return as output
    return int(input_str)

# Test cases
print(generated_function('101'))  # Output: 101
print(generated_function('1002'))  # Output: 1002
print(generated_function('743'))  # Output: 743
print(generated_function("101"))  ## Output: 101
print(generated_function("1002"))  ## Output: 1002
print(generated_function("743"))  ## Output: 743
