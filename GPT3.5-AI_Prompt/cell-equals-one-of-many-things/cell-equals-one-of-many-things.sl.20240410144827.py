Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Summary for Input Column Data:
- The input column data consists of colors: yellow, gray, black, blue, pink, orange, and turkey.
- The colors yellow, blue, pink, and orange have a corresponding output of true, while gray, black, and turkey have a corresponding output of false.

Summary for Output Column:
- The output column consists of boolean values, true or false, based on the input color.
- The colors yellow, blue, pink, and orange result in a true output, while gray, black, and turkey result in a false output.

Relationship between Input and Output:
- The relationship between the input colors and the output is that certain colors (yellow, blue, pink, orange) lead to a true output, while others (gray, black, turkey) lead to a false output.
- It appears that the colors associated with warm and bright hues (yellow, blue, pink, orange) result in a true output, while colors associated with neutral or uncommon hues (gray, black, turkey) result in a false output., and input as ['yellow'] output is true, input as ['gray'] output is false, input as ['black'] output is false, input as ['blue'] output is true, input as ['pink'] output is true, input as ['orange'] output is true, input as ['turkey'] output is false, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
