Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Summary for Input Column Data:
- The input column data consists of colors: yellow, gray, black, blue, pink, orange, and turkey.
- The colors yellow, blue, pink, and orange are present in the input data.
- The colors gray, black, and turkey are not present in the input data.

Summary for Output Column Data:
- The output column data consists of true and false values.
- The output is true for the colors yellow, blue, pink, and orange.
- The output is false for the colors gray, black, and turkey.

Relationship between Input and Output:
- The output is true for the colors yellow, blue, pink, and orange, which are all present in the input data.
- The output is false for the colors gray, black, and turkey, which are not present in the input data.
- The relationship between the input colors and the output values is that the output is true if the input color is yellow, blue, pink, or orange, and false if the input color is gray, black, or turkey., and input as ['yellow'] output is true, input as ['gray'] output is false, input as ['black'] output is false, input as ['blue'] output is true, input as ['pink'] output is true, input as ['orange'] output is true, input as ['turkey'] output is false, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
