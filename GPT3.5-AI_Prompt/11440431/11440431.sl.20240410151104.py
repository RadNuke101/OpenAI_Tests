Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Summary for Input Column Data:
- The input column data consists of various industries or activities such as Mining, Soybean Farming, Oil Extraction, and Fishing. These activities are diverse and represent different sectors of the economy.

Summary for Output Column Data:
- The output column data consists of the main activity or industry associated with each input. It includes Mining, Soybean Farming, Oil Extraction, and Fishing.

Relationship between Input and Output:
- The input column data represents different industries or activities, while the output column data represents the main activity or industry associated with each input. The relationship between the input and output is that the output column provides a simplified version of the input, focusing on the main activity or industry. This relationship helps to categorize and summarize the diverse input data into more manageable and understandable categories., and input as ['Mining US'] output is Mining, input as ['Soybean Farming CAN'] output is Soybean Farming, input as ['Soybean Farming'] output is Soybean Farming, input as ['Oil Extraction US'] output is Oil Extraction, input as ['Fishing'] output is Fishing, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.

# Define the generated function
def generated_function(input_str):
    # Split the input string to extract the main activity or industry
    input_list = input_str.split()
    output = input_list[0]
    
    return output

# Test cases
print(generated_function('Mining US')) # Output: Mining
print(generated_function('Soybean Farming CAN')) # Output: Soybean
print(generated_function('Soybean Farming')) # Output: Soybean
print(generated_function('Oil Extraction US')) # Output: Oil
print(generated_function('Fishing')) # Output: Fishing
print(generated_function("Mining US"))  ## Output: Mining
print(generated_function("Soybean Farming CAN"))  ## Output: Soybean Farming
print(generated_function("Soybean Farming"))  ## Output: Soybean Farming
print(generated_function("Oil Extraction US"))  ## Output: Oil Extraction
print(generated_function("Fishing"))  ## Output: Fishing
