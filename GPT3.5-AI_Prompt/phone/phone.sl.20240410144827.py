Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Summary for Input Column Data:
- The input column data consists of phone numbers in the format XXX-XXX-XXX.
- Each phone number is unique and does not repeat in the dataset.
- The first part of the phone number seems to be a random three-digit number.

Summary for Output Column:
- The output column consists of the first three digits of each phone number in the input column.
- The output values are unique and do not repeat in the dataset.
- The output values seem to represent the area code of the phone numbers.

Relationship between Input and Output:
- The relationship between the input and output columns is that the output column represents the area code of each phone number in the input column.
- The first three digits of each phone number in the input column directly correspond to the values in the output column.
- The output column serves as a simplified representation of the area codes present in the input data., and input as ['938-242-504'] output is 938, input as ['308-916-545'] output is 308, input as ['623-599-749'] output is 623, input as ['981-424-843'] output is 981, input as ['118-980-214'] output is 118, input as ['244-655-094'] output is 244, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.

    return output
