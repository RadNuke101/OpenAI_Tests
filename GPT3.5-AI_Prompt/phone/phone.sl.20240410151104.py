Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Summary for Input Column Data:
- The input column data consists of phone numbers in the format XXX-XXX-XXX.
- Each phone number is unique and does not repeat in the dataset.
- The first three digits of each phone number vary, indicating different area codes.

Summary for Output Column:
- The output column consists of the first three digits of each phone number in the input column.
- The output values are unique and do not repeat in the dataset.
- The output values represent the area codes of the phone numbers in the input column.

Relationship between Input and Output:
- The output column (first three digits of each phone number) directly corresponds to the area code of the phone numbers in the input column.
- By analyzing the output column, we can determine the area codes associated with the phone numbers provided in the input column.
- The relationship between the input and output is clear and consistent, with each input phone number mapping to a unique output area code., and input as ['938-242-504'] output is 938, input as ['308-916-545'] output is 308, input as ['623-599-749'] output is 623, input as ['981-424-843'] output is 981, input as ['118-980-214'] output is 118, input as ['244-655-094'] output is 244, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.

# Define the generated function
def generated_function(input_str):
    # Split the input string to extract the phone number
    phone_number = input_str.split('-')
    # Extract the area code (first three digits) from the phone number
    area_code = phone_number[0]
    # Return the area code as output
    return area_code

# Test cases
print(generated_function('938-242-504'))  # Output: 938
print(generated_function('308-916-545'))  # Output: 308
print(generated_function('623-599-749'))  # Output: 623
print(generated_function('981-424-843'))  # Output: 981
