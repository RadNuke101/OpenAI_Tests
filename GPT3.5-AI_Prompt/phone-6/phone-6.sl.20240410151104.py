Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Summary for Input Column Data:
The input column data consists of phone numbers with country codes. Each entry starts with a country code followed by a phone number separated by hyphens. The country codes vary in length and format, but they all begin with a plus sign. The phone numbers consist of three sets of digits separated by hyphens.

Summary for Output Column Data:
The output column data consists of the middle set of digits from the phone numbers in the input column. These middle digits represent the area code or regional code of the phone numbers. The output values range from three to four digits.

Relationship between Input and Output:
The output column data represents the area code or regional code of the phone numbers in the input column. By extracting the middle set of digits, we can identify the specific region or area associated with each phone number. The relationship between the input and output is that the output provides a key piece of information about the geographical location of the phone numbers., and input as ['+106 769-858-438'] output is 769, input as ['+83 973-757-831'] output is 973, input as ['+62 647-787-775'] output is 647, input as ['+172 027-507-632'] output is 027, input as ['+72 001-050-856'] output is 001, input as ['+95 310-537-401'] output is 310, input as ['+6 775-969-238'] output is 775, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
