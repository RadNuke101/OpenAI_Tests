Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: The input data consists of phone numbers with country codes and phone number formats. The output data transforms the phone numbers into a standardized format with parentheses around the area code. 

The relationship between the input and output is that the output format consistently adds parentheses around the area code of the phone number while maintaining the country code and phone number format. This transformation ensures a standardized and visually appealing representation of the phone numbers. 

Overall, the input data provides various phone numbers with different country codes and formats, while the output data presents these numbers in a uniform and easily recognizable format., and input as ['+106 769-858-438'] output is +106 (769) 858-438, input as ['+83 973-757-831'] output is +83 (973) 757-831, input as ['+62 647-787-775'] output is +62 (647) 787-775, input as ['+172 027-507-632'] output is +172 (027) 507-632, input as ['+72 001-050-856'] output is +72 (001) 050-856, input as ['+95 310-537-401'] output is +95 (310) 537-401, input as ['+6 775-969-238'] output is +6 (775) 969-238, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
