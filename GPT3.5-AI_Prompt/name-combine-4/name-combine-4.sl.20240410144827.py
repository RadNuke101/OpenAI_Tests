Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Summary for Input Column Data:
- The input column data consists of pairs of first and last names.
- The first names in the input data are varied and unique.
- The last names in the input data are also diverse and distinct.

Summary for Output Column Data:
- The output column data consists of last names followed by the first initial of the corresponding first name.
- The output format consistently displays the last name first, followed by a comma and the first initial with a period.

Relationship between Input and Output:
- The relationship between the input and output is that the last name from the input data is used as the first element in the output, followed by a comma and the first initial of the corresponding first name.
- The output format is a rearrangement of the input data, with the last name taking precedence in the output.
- The output provides a concise and standardized way of presenting the input data, emphasizing the last name., and input as ['Launa', 'Withers'] output is Withers, L., input as ['Lakenya', 'Edison'] output is Edison, L., input as ['Brendan', 'Hage'] output is Hage, B., input as ['Bradford', 'Lango'] output is Lango, B., input as ['Rudolf', 'Akiyama'] output is Akiyama, R., , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.

# Define the generated function
def generated_function(first_name, last_name):
    # Rearrange the input data to match the output format
    output = last_name + ', ' + first_name[0] + '.'
    
    return output

# Test cases
print(generated_function('Launa', 'Withers'))
print(generated_function('Lakenya', 'Edison'))
print(generated_function('Brendan', 'Hage'))
print(generated_function('Bradford', 'Lango'))
print(generated_function('Rudolf', 'Akiyama'))
print(generated_function("Launa", "Withers"))  ## Output: Withers, L.
print(generated_function("Lakenya", "Edison"))  ## Output: Edison, L.
print(generated_function("Brendan", "Hage"))  ## Output: Hage, B.
print(generated_function("Bradford", "Lango"))  ## Output: Lango, B.
print(generated_function("Rudolf", "Akiyama"))  ## Output: Akiyama, R.
