Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Summary for Input Column 1 (First Names):
- The first names in the input column are Launa, Lakenya, Brendan, Bradford, and Rudolf.

Summary for Input Column 2 (Last Names):
- The last names in the input column are Withers, Edison, Hage, Lango, and Akiyama.

Summary for Output Column (Last Name, First Initial):
- The output column consists of the last names Withers, Edison, Hage, Lango, and Akiyama with the corresponding first initials L, L, B, B, and R.

Relationship between Input and Output:
- The output column consists of the last names of the individuals in the input column, followed by their first initial. This relationship allows for easy identification and organization of individuals based on their last names and first initials., and input as ['Launa', 'Withers'] output is Withers, L., input as ['Lakenya', 'Edison'] output is Edison, L., input as ['Brendan', 'Hage'] output is Hage, B., input as ['Bradford', 'Lango'] output is Lango, B., input as ['Rudolf', 'Akiyama'] output is Akiyama, R., , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.

# Define the generated function
def generated_function(first_name, last_name):
    # Combine the last name and first initial
    output = last_name + ', ' + first_name[0] + '.'
    return output

# Test cases
print(generated_function('Launa', 'Withers'))
print(generated_function('Lakenya', 'Edison'))
print(generated_function('Brendan', 'Hage'))
print(generated_function('Bradford', 'Lango'))
print(generated_function('Rudolf', 'Akiyama'))
print(generated_function("Launa", "Withers"))  ## Output: Withers, L.
print(generated_function("Lakenya", "Edison"))  ## Output: Edison, L.
print(generated_function("Brendan", "Hage"))  ## Output: Hage, B.
print(generated_function("Bradford", "Lango"))  ## Output: Lango, B.
print(generated_function("Rudolf", "Akiyama"))  ## Output: Akiyama, R.
