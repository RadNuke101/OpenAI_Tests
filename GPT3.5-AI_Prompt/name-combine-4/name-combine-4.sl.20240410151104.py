Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Summary for Input Column 1 (First Names):
- The first names in the input column are diverse and unique, ranging from Launa to Rudolf.
- There is no clear pattern or trend in the first names provided.

Summary for Input Column 2 (Last Names):
- The last names in the input column are also varied, including Withers, Edison, Hage, Lango, and Akiyama.
- Like the first names, there is no apparent connection or similarity between the last names.

Summary for Output Column (Last Name, First Initial):
- The output column consists of the last name followed by the first initial, such as Withers, L. and Edison, L.
- The pattern observed is that the last name comes first followed by a comma and then the first initial.

Relationship between Input and Output:
- The output column seems to be derived from the input columns by taking the last name and first initial of the corresponding first name.
- There is a clear relationship between the input and output columns, where the last name from the input is combined with the first initial to form the output.
- The output column provides a concise and standardized way of representing the input data, making it easier to identify individuals., and input as ['Launa', 'Withers'] output is Withers, L., input as ['Lakenya', 'Edison'] output is Edison, L., input as ['Brendan', 'Hage'] output is Hage, B., input as ['Bradford', 'Lango'] output is Lango, B., input as ['Rudolf', 'Akiyama'] output is Akiyama, R., , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.

print(generated_function("Launa", "Withers"))  ## Output: Withers, L.
print(generated_function("Lakenya", "Edison"))  ## Output: Edison, L.
print(generated_function("Brendan", "Hage"))  ## Output: Hage, B.
print(generated_function("Bradford", "Lango"))  ## Output: Lango, B.
print(generated_function("Rudolf", "Akiyama"))  ## Output: Akiyama, R.
