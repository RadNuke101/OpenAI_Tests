Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Summary for Input Column Data:
- The input column data consists of qualitative values representing different numbers with symbols like % and -.
- The values in the input column data include both positive and negative numbers, as well as decimal numbers.

Summary for Output Column Data:
- The output column data consists of numerical values without any symbols or special characters.
- The output column data represents the cleaned and formatted version of the input values.

Relationship between Input and Output:
- The input column data includes various formats and symbols to represent numbers, while the output column data presents the cleaned and standardized version of the input values.
- The relationship between the input and output is that the output column data removes any symbols or special characters from the input values to provide a clear and consistent representation of the numbers.
- The output column data serves as a processed and standardized version of the input values, making it easier to interpret and work with the numerical data., and input as ['-%134'] output is %134, input as ['500'] output is 500, input as ['5.125'] output is 5.125, input as ['-%43.00'] output is %43.00, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
