Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Input Column Summary:
The input column contains the names of various plant species, such as Polygonum amphibium, Hippuris vulgaris, Lysimachia vulgaris, Juncus bulbosus ssp. bulbosus, Lycopus europaeus ssp. europaeus, and Nymphaea alba.

Output Column Summary:
The output column contains the genus names of the plant species mentioned in the input column, such as Polygonum, Hippuris, Lysimachia, Juncus, Lycopus, and Nymphaea.

Relationship Summary:
The relationship between the input and output columns is that the output column provides the genus name of each plant species listed in the input column. By extracting the genus name from the full species name, we can identify the common genus shared by different species. This relationship helps in categorizing and organizing plant species based on their shared characteristics and evolutionary relationships., and input as ['Polygonum amphibium'] output is Polygonum, input as ['Hippuris vulgaris'] output is Hippuris, input as ['Lysimachia vulgaris'] output is Lysimachia, input as ['Juncus bulbosus ssp. bulbosus'] output is Juncus bulbosus, input as ['Lycopus europaeus ssp. europaeus'] output is Lycopus europaeus, input as ['Nymphaea alba'] output is Nymphaea, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.

# Define the generated function
def generated_function(input_str):
    # Split the input string to extract the plant species name
    input_list = input_str.split()
    
    # Extract the genus name from the plant species name
    output_list = [name.split()[0] for name in input_list]
    
    # Return the output as a string
    return ' '.join(output_list)

# Test cases
