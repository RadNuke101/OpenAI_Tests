Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Summary for Input Column Data:
The input column data consists of phone numbers with country codes and formatted with spaces and hyphens. Each entry follows the pattern of starting with a country code, followed by the phone number separated by spaces and hyphens.

Summary for Output Column Data:
The output column data consists of formatted phone numbers with country codes enclosed in parentheses and separated by spaces and hyphens. The output format consistently follows the pattern of enclosing the country code in parentheses and separating the phone number with spaces and hyphens.

Relationship between Input and Output:
The relationship between the input and output is that the input phone numbers are formatted with country codes, spaces, and hyphens, while the output phone numbers are reformatted to enclose the country code in parentheses and separate the phone number with spaces and hyphens. The output format transforms the input phone numbers into a standardized format with the country code enclosed in parentheses for consistency and clarity., and input as ['+106 769-858-438'] output is +106 (769) 858-438, input as ['+83 973-757-831'] output is +83 (973) 757-831, input as ['+62 647-787-775'] output is +62 (647) 787-775, input as ['+172 027-507-632'] output is +172 (027) 507-632, input as ['+72 001-050-856'] output is +72 (001) 050-856, input as ['+95 310-537-401'] output is +95 (310) 537-401, input as ['+6 775-969-238'] output is +6 (775) 969-238, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
