Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Summary for Input Column 1 (Universities):
- The input column contains names of various universities such as University of Pennsylvania, UCLA, Cornell University, Penn, University of Maryland College Park, and University of Michigan.

Summary for Input Column 2 (Locations):
- The input column contains locations associated with the universities such as Philadelphia, PA, USA; Los Angeles, CA; Ithaca, New York, USA; College Park, MD; and Ann Arbor, MI, USA.

Summary for Output Column (Locations):
- The output column consists of the locations associated with the universities mentioned in the input. It includes cities and states such as Philadelphia, PA, USA; Los Angeles, CA, USA; Ithaca, New York, USA; College Park, MD, USA; and Ann Arbor, MI, USA.

Relationship between Input and Output:
- The input column provides the names of universities along with their respective locations. The output column reflects the locations mentioned in the input. The relationship between the input and output is that the output represents the specific locations associated with each university mentioned in the input. The output serves as a geographical reference for the universities listed in the input., and input as ['University of Pennsylvania', 'Phialdelphia, PA, USA'] output is Phialdelphia, PA, USA, input as ['UCLA', 'Los Angeles, CA'] output is Los Angeles, CA, USA, input as ['Cornell University', 'Ithaca, New York, USA'] output is Ithaca, New York, USA, input as ['Penn', 'Philadelphia, PA, USA'] output is Philadelphia, PA, USA, input as ['University of Maryland College Park', 'College Park, MD'] output is College Park, MD, USA, input as ['University of Michigan', 'Ann Arbor, MI, USA'] output is Ann Arbor, MI, USA, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.

# Define the generated function
def generated_function(input_str):
    # Split the input string into university and location
    university, location = input_str.split(', ')
    
    # Return the location
    return location

# Test cases
print(generated_function('University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA')) # Output: Philadelphia, PA, USA
print(generated_function('UCLA, Los Angeles, CA')) # Output: Los Angeles, CA
print(generated_function('Cornell University, Ithaca, New York, USA')) # Output: Ithaca, New York, USA
print(generated_function('Penn, Philadelphia, PA, USA')) # Output: Philadelphia, PA, USA
print(generated_function('University of Maryland College Park, College Park, MD')) # Output: College Park, MD, USA
print(generated_function('University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA')) # Output: Ann Arbor, MI, USA
print(generated_function("University of Pennsylvania", "Phialdelphia, PA, USA"))  ## Output: Phialdelphia, PA, USA
print(generated_function("UCLA", "Los Angeles, CA"))  ## Output: Los Angeles, CA, USA
print(generated_function("Cornell University", "Ithaca, New York, USA"))  ## Output: Ithaca, New York, USA
print(generated_function("Penn", "Philadelphia, PA, USA"))  ## Output: Philadelphia, PA, USA
print(generated_function("University of Maryland College Park", "College Park, MD"))  ## Output: College Park, MD, USA
print(generated_function("University of Michigan", "Ann Arbor, MI, USA"))  ## Output: Ann Arbor, MI, USA
