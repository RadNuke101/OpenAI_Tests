Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Summary for Input Column Data:
- The input column data consists of pairs of first and last names.
- The first names in the input data are varied and include names like Nancy, Andrew, Jan, and Mariya.
- The last names in the input data are also diverse, such as FreeHafer, Cencici, Kotas, and Sergienko.

Summary for Output Column Data:
- The output column data consists of the first initial of the first name followed by a period and a space, and then the last name.
- The output column data shows a consistent format of displaying the first initial of the first name and the full last name.

Relationship between Input and Output:
- The relationship between the input and output is that the output column data takes the first initial of the first name and combines it with the full last name.
- The output column data simplifies the input data by condensing the first name to just the initial and maintaining the full last name.
- This relationship allows for a concise and standardized way of representing the input data., and input as ['Nancy', 'FreeHafer'] output is Nancy F., input as ['Andrew', 'Cencici'] output is Andrew C., input as ['Jan', 'Kotas'] output is Jan K., input as ['Mariya', 'Sergienko'] output is Mariya S., , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.

# Define the generated function
def generated_function(first_name, last_name):
    # Combine the first initial of the first name with the full last name
    output = first_name[0] + '. ' + last_name
    return output

# Test cases
print(generated_function('Nancy', 'FreeHafer'))  # Output: Nancy F.
print(generated_function('Andrew', 'Cencici'))  # Output: Andrew C.
print(generated_function('Jan', 'Kotas'))  # Output: Jan K.
print(generated_function('Mariya', 'Sergienko'))  # Output: Mariya S.
print(generated_function("Nancy", "FreeHafer"))  ## Output: Nancy F.
print(generated_function("Andrew", "Cencici"))  ## Output: Andrew C.
print(generated_function("Jan", "Kotas"))  ## Output: Jan K.
print(generated_function("Mariya", "Sergienko"))  ## Output: Mariya S.
