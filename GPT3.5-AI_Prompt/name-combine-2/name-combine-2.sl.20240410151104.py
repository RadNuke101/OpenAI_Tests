Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Summary for Input Column 1 (First Names):
- The input column 1 consists of various first names such as Nancy, Andrew, Jan, and Mariya.

Summary for Input Column 2 (Last Names):
- The input column 2 consists of various last names such as FreeHafer, Cencici, Kotas, and Sergienko.

Summary for Output Column (First Initial and Last Name):
- The output column consists of the first initial of the first name followed by the last name, such as Nancy F., Andrew C., Jan K., and Mariya S.

Relationship between Input and Output:
- The output column combines the first initial of the first name with the last name from the input columns. This relationship creates a concise and unique representation of each individual's full name. The output column effectively condenses the information from the input columns into a simplified format for easy identification., and input as ['Nancy', 'FreeHafer'] output is Nancy F., input as ['Andrew', 'Cencici'] output is Andrew C., input as ['Jan', 'Kotas'] output is Jan K., input as ['Mariya', 'Sergienko'] output is Mariya S., , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.

# Define the generated function
def generated_function(first_name, last_name):
    # Combine the first initial of the first name with the last name
    output = first_name[0] + '. ' + last_name
    return output

# Test cases
print(generated_function('Nancy', 'FreeHafer'))  # Output: Nancy F.
print(generated_function('Andrew', 'Cencici'))  # Output: Andrew C.
print(generated_function('Jan', 'Kotas'))  # Output: Jan K.
print(generated_function('Mariya', 'Sergienko'))  # Output: Mariya S.
print(generated_function("Nancy", "FreeHafer"))  ## Output: Nancy F.
print(generated_function("Andrew", "Cencici"))  ## Output: Andrew C.
print(generated_function("Jan", "Kotas"))  ## Output: Jan K.
print(generated_function("Mariya", "Sergienko"))  ## Output: Mariya S.
