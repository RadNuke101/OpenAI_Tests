Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Summary for Input Column Data:
- The input column data consists of phone numbers in the format XXX-XXX-XXX, where each X represents a digit.
- Each phone number is unique and does not repeat in the input column data.
- The input column data does not follow any specific pattern or sequence.

Summary for Output Column Data:
- The output column data consists of phone numbers in the format XXX.XXX.XXX, where each X represents a digit.
- The output column data is derived from the input column data by replacing the hyphens with periods.
- The output column data maintains the same order of digits as the input column data.

Relationship between Input and Output:
- The relationship between the input and output is a simple transformation of the phone numbers.
- The output is obtained by replacing the hyphens in the input phone numbers with periods.
- The input and output data are directly related, with each input phone number corresponding to a specific output phone number., and input as ['938-242-504'] output is 938.242.504, input as ['308-916-545'] output is 308.916.545, input as ['623-599-749'] output is 623.599.749, input as ['981-424-843'] output is 981.424.843, input as ['118-980-214'] output is 118.980.214, input as ['244-655-094'] output is 244.655.094, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
