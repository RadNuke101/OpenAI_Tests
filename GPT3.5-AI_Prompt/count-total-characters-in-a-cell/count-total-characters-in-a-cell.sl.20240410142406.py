Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Summary for Input Column Data:
- The first input column data consists of one word, 'The'.
- The second input column data consists of three words, 'The quick fox'.
- The third input column data consists of three words, 'The quick fox' with an extra space between 'quick' and 'fox'.

Summary for Output Column Data:
- The output column data consists of three numerical values, 3, 13, and 14.

Relationship between Input and Output:
- The length of the input data seems to directly correspond to the numerical output value.
- The number of characters in the input data appears to be the basis for the output value.
- The presence of extra spaces in the input data also affects the output value, as seen in the third input., and input as ['The'] output is 3, input as ['The quick fox'] output is 13, input as ['The quick  fox'] output is 14, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.

# Define the generated function
def generated_function(*args):
    output = []
    for arg in args:
        # Calculate the length of the input data
        length = len(arg)
        # Check for extra spaces and adjust the length accordingly
        if '  ' in arg:
            length += 1
        output.append(length)
    return output

# Test cases
print(generated_function('The'))  # Output: 3
print(generated_function('The quick fox'))  # Output: 13
print(generated_function('The quick  fox'))  # Output: 14
print(generated_function("The"))  ## Output: 3
print(generated_function("The quick fox"))  ## Output: 13
print(generated_function("The quick  fox"))  ## Output: 14
