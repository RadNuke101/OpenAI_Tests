Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Summary for Input Column Data:
- The first input column data is ['The'] with a length of 3 characters.
- The second input column data is ['The quick fox'] with a length of 13 characters.
- The third input column data is ['The quick  fox'] with a length of 14 characters.

Summary for Output Column Data:
- The output column data consists of the lengths of the input column data: 3, 13, and 14.

Relationship between Input and Output:
- The output column data seems to be directly related to the length of the input column data. The output value is the length of the input string, indicating a simple transformation or mapping between the input and output., and input as ['The'] output is 3, input as ['The quick fox'] output is 13, input as ['The quick  fox'] output is 14, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.

# Define the generated function
def generated_function(input_str):
    # Calculate the length of the input string
    output = len(input_str)
    return output

# Test cases
print(generated_function('The'))  # Output: 3
print(generated_function('The quick fox'))  # Output: 13
print(generated_function('The quick  fox'))  # Output: 14
print(generated_function("The"))  ## Output: 3
print(generated_function("The quick fox"))  ## Output: 13
print(generated_function("The quick  fox"))  ## Output: 14
