Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Summary for Input Column Data:
- The input column data consists of company names related to the trucking industry.
- The names vary in length and structure, including variations such as abbreviations, full names, and additional identifiers like "Inc." and "LLC".

Summary for Output Column Data:
- The output column data consists of modified versions of the input company names, with certain elements removed or adjusted.
- The modifications involve removing terms like "Inc." and "LLC" and potentially shortening the company names.

Relationship between Input and Output:
- The relationship between the input and output columns involves simplifying and refining the company names for a clearer and more concise representation.
- The output column appears to focus on extracting the essential components of the input names, such as the main company name, while omitting unnecessary details like legal identifiers.
- The process seems to aim at creating a more streamlined and user-friendly version of the original company names for easier reference and recognition in a business context., and input as ['Trucking Inc.'] output is Trucking, input as ['New Truck Inc'] output is New Truck, input as ['ABV Trucking Inc, LLC'] output is ABV Trucking, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
