Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Summary for Input Column Data:
- The input column data consists of company names related to the trucking industry.
- The company names vary in length and structure, with some including additional information such as 'Inc.', 'LLC', etc.

Summary for Output Column:
- The output column consists of the company names extracted from the input data by removing any additional information such as 'Inc.', 'LLC', etc.
- The output column represents the core name of the trucking companies.

Relationship between Input and Output:
- The input column data provides a range of company names within the trucking industry, each with varying structures and additional information.
- The output column simplifies the company names by extracting the core name, which is essential for identifying the trucking companies.
- The relationship between the input and output is that the output column focuses on the essential name of the trucking companies, providing a clearer and more concise representation of the companies., and input as ['Trucking Inc.'] output is Trucking, input as ['New Truck Inc'] output is New Truck, input as ['ABV Trucking Inc, LLC'] output is ABV Trucking, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
