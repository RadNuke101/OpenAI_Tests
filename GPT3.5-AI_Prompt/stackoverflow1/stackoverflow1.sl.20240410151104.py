Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Input Column Summary:
- The input column data consists of company names related to the trucking industry.
- The names vary in length and structure, with some including additional information like "Inc." or "LLC".

Output Column Summary:
- The output column data consists of the company names extracted from the input column data.
- The output names have been simplified by removing any additional information like "Inc." or "LLC".

Relationship Summary:
- The relationship between the input and output columns is that the output column represents a simplified version of the company names provided in the input column.
- The output column focuses on the core name of the company, removing any extraneous information that may be present in the input column.
- This simplification process helps to standardize the company names and make them more concise and easily recognizable in the context of the trucking industry., and input as ['Trucking Inc.'] output is Trucking, input as ['New Truck Inc'] output is New Truck, input as ['ABV Trucking Inc, LLC'] output is ABV Trucking, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.

    return output

# Test cases
generated_function('Trucking Inc.', 'New Truck Inc', 'ABV Trucking Inc, LLC')
print(generated_function("Trucking Inc."))  ## Output: Trucking
print(generated_function("New Truck Inc"))  ## Output: New Truck
