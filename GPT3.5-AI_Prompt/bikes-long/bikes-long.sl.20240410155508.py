Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: The input data consists of different brands of motorcycles and their corresponding engine sizes. The output data is the brand of the motorcycle. 

Summary of input data:
- The input data includes brands such as Ducati, Honda, Acura, and Ferrari.
- Each brand is followed by a number indicating the engine size of the motorcycle.

Summary of output data:
- The output data consists of the brand of the motorcycle.

Relationship between input and output:
- The output (brand of the motorcycle) is directly derived from the input data, specifically the brand name mentioned in each input.
- The input data provides information about the brand and engine size of the motorcycle, and the output simply identifies the brand based on this information.

Overall, the input data provides specific details about the motorcycles, while the output data simplifies this information by focusing solely on the brand name., and input as ['Ducati100'] output is Ducati, input as ['Honda125'] output is Honda, input as ['Ducati250'] output is Ducati, input as ['Honda250'] output is Honda, input as ['Honda550'] output is Honda, input as ['Ducati125'] output is Ducati, input as ['Acura100'] output is Acura, input as ['Acura125'] output is Acura, input as ['Ferrari250'] output is Ferrari, input as ['Ferrari250'] output is Ferrari, input as ['Honda550'] output is Honda, input as ['Ducati125'] output is Ducati, input as ['Ducati100'] output is Ducati, input as ['Honda125'] output is Honda, input as ['Ducati250'] output is Ducati, input as ['Honda250'] output is Honda, input as ['Honda550'] output is Honda, input as ['Ducati125'] output is Ducati, input as ['Acura100'] output is Acura, input as ['Acura125'] output is Acura, input as ['Ferrari250'] output is Ferrari, input as ['Ferrari250'] output is Ferrari, input as ['Honda550'] output is Honda, input as ['Ducati125'] output is Ducati, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
