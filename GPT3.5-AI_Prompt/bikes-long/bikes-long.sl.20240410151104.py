Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: The input data consists of different brand names followed by a number. The output is always the brand name without the number. 

Summary for Input Column Data:
- The input data includes various brand names such as Ducati, Honda, Acura, and Ferrari, followed by a number.
- Each brand name is associated with a specific number, but the number itself does not impact the output.
- The input data does not follow a specific pattern or sequence, as different brand names appear in random order.

Summary for Output Column Data:
- The output column consistently displays the brand name without the accompanying number.
- The output is determined solely by the brand name in the input, as the number following the brand name does not affect the output.
- The output column reflects a direct relationship between the input brand names and their corresponding output brand names.

Relationship between Input and Output:
- The relationship between the input and output is straightforward and deterministic.
- The output is directly derived from the brand name in the input, with the number being irrelevant to the final result.
- The output is a clear reflection of the brand name provided in the input, indicating a one-to-one mapping between the input brand names and their corresponding output brand names., and input as ['Ducati100'] output is Ducati, input as ['Honda125'] output is Honda, input as ['Ducati250'] output is Ducati, input as ['Honda250'] output is Honda, input as ['Honda550'] output is Honda, input as ['Ducati125'] output is Ducati, input as ['Acura100'] output is Acura, input as ['Acura125'] output is Acura, input as ['Ferrari250'] output is Ferrari, input as ['Ferrari250'] output is Ferrari, input as ['Honda550'] output is Honda, input as ['Ducati125'] output is Ducati, input as ['Ducati100'] output is Ducati, input as ['Honda125'] output is Honda, input as ['Ducati250'] output is Ducati, input as ['Honda250'] output is Honda, input as ['Honda550'] output is Honda, input as ['Ducati125'] output is Ducati, input as ['Acura100'] output is Acura, input as ['Acura125'] output is Acura, input as ['Ferrari250'] output is Ferrari, input as ['Ferrari250'] output is Ferrari, input as ['Honda550'] output is Honda, input as ['Ducati125'] output is Ducati, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
