Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: The input data consists of various brands and model numbers of motorcycles, such as Ducati, Honda, Acura, and Ferrari. The output data is the brand name extracted from the input data.

Summary of Input Data:
- The input data includes a variety of motorcycle brands and model numbers.
- The brands mentioned in the input data are Ducati, Honda, Acura, and Ferrari.
- Each input consists of a brand name followed by a model number.

Summary of Output Data:
- The output data consists of the brand names extracted from the input data.
- The output includes the brand names Ducati, Honda, Acura, and Ferrari.

Relationship between Input and Output:
- The relationship between the input and output data is that the output is derived from the brand names mentioned in the input data.
- The output column reflects the brand names present in the input data, indicating a direct relationship between the two.
- The output column serves as a simplified version of the input data, focusing solely on the brand names., and input as ['Ducati100'] output is Ducati, input as ['Honda125'] output is Honda, input as ['Ducati250'] output is Ducati, input as ['Honda250'] output is Honda, input as ['Honda550'] output is Honda, input as ['Ducati125'] output is Ducati, input as ['Acura100'] output is Acura, input as ['Acura125'] output is Acura, input as ['Ferrari250'] output is Ferrari, input as ['Ferrari250'] output is Ferrari, input as ['Honda550'] output is Honda, input as ['Ducati125'] output is Ducati, input as ['Ducati100'] output is Ducati, input as ['Honda125'] output is Honda, input as ['Ducati250'] output is Ducati, input as ['Honda250'] output is Honda, input as ['Honda550'] output is Honda, input as ['Ducati125'] output is Ducati, input as ['Acura100'] output is Acura, input as ['Acura125'] output is Acura, input as ['Ferrari250'] output is Ferrari, input as ['Ferrari250'] output is Ferrari, input as ['Honda550'] output is Honda, input as ['Ducati125'] output is Ducati, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
