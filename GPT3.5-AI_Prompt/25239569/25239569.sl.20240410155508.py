Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: The input data consists of different types of ad formats with various specifications such as size, pricing model, targeting, and deck type. The output data seems to be a standardized format that includes the original ad format with some modifications to make it more descriptive and user-friendly.

The relationship between the input and output columns is that the output column provides a more detailed and user-friendly description of the ad format compared to the input column. It seems like the output column aims to make it easier for users to understand the ad format by including additional information such as the type of ad (e.g., Branding, Leads, Direct Response), targeting details, and deck type.

Overall, the output column serves as a more informative and descriptive version of the input column, providing users with a clearer understanding of the ad format and its specifications., and input as ['Adf_ROCLeader_BAN_728x90_CPM_STD _BRD _NRT_DCK'] output is Adf_ROCLeader_BAN_728x90_CPM_STD _Branding _NRT_DCK, input as ['MMC_ContextualLarRec_BAN_336x280_CPM_STD _LDS _RTG_DCK'] output is MMC_ContextualLarRec_BAN_336x280_CPM_STD _Leads _RTG_DCK, input as ['Adf_ROC_DLBD_728x90_CPM_STD_DRS_NRT_NOR_DCK'] output is Adf_ROC_DLBD_728x90_CPM_STD_Direct Response_NRT_NOR_DCK, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
