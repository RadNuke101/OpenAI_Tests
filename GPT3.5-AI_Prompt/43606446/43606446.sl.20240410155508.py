Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: For the input columns, we can see that each entry consists of a currency pair followed by exchange options in angle brackets. The exchange options include IDEALPRO, CASH, and another currency. The currencies mentioned in the exchange options are EUR, USD, WON, and YEN.

Summary for Input Columns:
- Currency pairs include USD.EUR and KOR.JPN.
- Exchange options include IDEALPRO, CASH, and another currency.
- The currencies mentioned in the exchange options are EUR, USD, WON, and YEN.

Summary for Output Column:
- The output column includes the currencies EUR, USD, WON, and YEN.

Relationship between Input and Output:
- The output currency is determined by the exchange option that includes the output currency in the input column. For example, if the exchange option includes EUR, the output will be EUR. If the exchange option includes USD, the output will be USD. This relationship indicates that the output currency is directly influenced by the exchange options mentioned in the input column., and input as ['USD.EUR<IDEALPRO,CASH,EUR>'] output is EUR, input as ['USD.EUR<IDEALPRO,CASH,USD>'] output is USD, input as ['KOR.JPN<IDEALPRO,CASH,WON>'] output is WON, input as ['KOR.JPN<IDEALPRO,CASH,YEN>'] output is YEN, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.

# Define the generated function

    input_list = input_str.split('<')

    exchange_options = input_list[1][:-1].split(',')
    
    # Determine the output currency based on the exchange options
    for option in exchange_options:

            return 'EUR'
        elif option == 'USD':

print(generated_function("USD.EUR<IDEALPRO,CASH,EUR>"))  ## Output: EUR
print(generated_function("USD.EUR<IDEALPRO,CASH,USD>"))  ## Output: USD
print(generated_function("KOR.JPN<IDEALPRO,CASH,WON>"))  ## Output: WON
print(generated_function("KOR.JPN<IDEALPRO,CASH,YEN>"))  ## Output: YEN
