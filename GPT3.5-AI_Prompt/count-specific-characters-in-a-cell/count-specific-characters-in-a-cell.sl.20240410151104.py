Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Summary for Input Column Data:
- The input column data consists of the name "Hannah" and a single letter that varies (e.g., 'n', 'x', 'N', 'a', 'h').
- The name "Hannah" remains constant in all input data.
- The single letter varies in each input, potentially affecting the output.

Summary for Output Column Data:
- The output column data consists of numerical values ranging from 0 to 2.
- The output values represent the number of occurrences of the specified letter in the name "Hannah" from the input data.

Relationship between Input and Output:
- The output value is determined by the frequency of the specified letter in the name "Hannah" from the input data.
- If the specified letter is present in the name "Hannah," the output will be the count of occurrences of that letter.
- If the specified letter is not present in the name "Hannah," the output will be 0.
- The relationship between the input and output is direct and based on the presence or absence of the specified letter in the name "Hannah.", and input as ['Hannah', 'n'] output is 2, input as ['Hannah', 'x'] output is 0, input as ['Hannah', 'N'] output is 0, input as ['Hannah', 'a'] output is 2, input as ['Hannah', 'h'] output is 1, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.

# Define the generated function

    # Count the occurrences of the specified letter in the name "Hannah"
    count = name.count(letter)
    return count

# Test cases
generated_function('Hannah', 'n')
generated_function('Hannah', 'x')
generated_function('Hannah', 'N')
generated_function('Hannah', 'a')
generated_function('Hannah', 'h')
print(generated_function("Hannah", "n"))  ## Output: 2
print(generated_function("Hannah", "x"))  ## Output: 0
print(generated_function("Hannah", "N"))  ## Output: 0
print(generated_function("Hannah", "a"))  ## Output: 2
print(generated_function("Hannah", "h"))  ## Output: 1
