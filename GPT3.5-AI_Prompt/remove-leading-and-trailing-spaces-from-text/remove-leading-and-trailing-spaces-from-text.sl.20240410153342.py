Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Summary for Input Column Data:
- The input column data consists of movie titles with varying amounts of whitespace at the beginning and between words.

Summary for Output Column:
- The output column consists of the movie titles without any extra whitespace.

Relationship between Input and Output:
- The relationship between the input and output is that the output column is the cleaned-up version of the input column data, where any extra whitespace has been removed. The output column reflects the true movie titles without any unnecessary spaces, making it more readable and consistent., and input as ['  The shawshank'] output is The shawshank, input as ['The    godfather'] output is The godfather, input as ['    pulp   fiction'] output is pulp fiction, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.

# Define the generated function
def generated_function(*args):
    # Initialize an empty list to store the cleaned-up movie titles
    cleaned_titles = []
    
    # Iterate through each input argument
    for title in args:
        # Remove extra whitespace using strip() and join the words using split()
        cleaned_title = ' '.join(title.strip().split())
        # Append the cleaned-up title to the list
        cleaned_titles.append(cleaned_title)
    
    # Return the list of cleaned-up movie titles
    return cleaned_titles

# Test cases
generated_function('  The shawshank', 'The    godfather', '    pulp   fiction')
print(generated_function("  The shawshank"))  ## Output: The shawshank
print(generated_function("The    godfather"))  ## Output: The godfather
print(generated_function("    pulp   fiction"))  ## Output: pulp fiction
