Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Input Column Summary:
- The input column contains email addresses or website domains that are related to communication or support requests.

Output Column Summary:
- The output column contains the specific domain name that is being contacted for support requests.

Relationship Summary:
- The input column provides information on who to contact for support requests, with the output column specifying the exact domain name or email address to reach out to. The relationship between the input and output is that the input provides the general context, while the output provides the specific contact information needed to address the support request., and input as ['send email to json_acme.com'] output is json_acme.com, input as ['contact help_robot.com for all support requests'] output is help_robot.com, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
