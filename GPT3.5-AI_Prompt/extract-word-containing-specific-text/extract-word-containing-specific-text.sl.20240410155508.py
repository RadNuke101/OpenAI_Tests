Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Input Column Summary:
- The input column contains email addresses or website domains that are related to communication or support requests.

Output Column Summary:
- The output column contains the specific email addresses or website domains that are being contacted for communication or support requests.

Relationship Summary:
- The input column provides information on who to contact for specific tasks or inquiries, while the output column specifies the exact contact information for each task or inquiry. The relationship between the input and output is that the input column guides the action to be taken, while the output column provides the specific details needed to carry out that action., and input as ['send email to json_acme.com'] output is json_acme.com, input as ['contact help_robot.com for all support requests'] output is help_robot.com, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
