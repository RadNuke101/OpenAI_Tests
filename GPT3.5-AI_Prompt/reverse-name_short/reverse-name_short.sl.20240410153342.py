Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Summary for Input Column 1 (First Names):
- The first names in the input column are Launa, Lakenya, Brendan, Bradford, Rudolf, Lara.
- The names appear to be of various origins and do not follow a specific pattern.

Summary for Input Column 2 (Last Names):
- The last names in the input column are Withers, Edison, Hage, Lango, Akiyama, Constable.
- Similar to the first names, the last names also do not follow a specific pattern and seem to be of diverse origins.

Summary for Output Column (Last Name First, First Name Last):
- The output column displays the last name followed by the first name for each input pair.
- The pattern observed is consistent across all inputs, where the last name is listed first followed by the first name.

Relationship between Input and Output:
- The relationship between the input and output is that the last name is listed before the first name in the output.
- The output format consistently follows the pattern of Last Name First, First Name Last for all input pairs.
- This suggests a specific formatting rule or convention being applied to the input data to generate the output., and input as ['Launa', 'Withers'] output is Withers Launa, input as ['Lakenya', 'Edison'] output is Edison Lakenya, input as ['Brendan', 'Hage'] output is Hage Brendan, input as ['Bradford', 'Lango'] output is Lango Bradford, input as ['Rudolf', 'Akiyama'] output is Akiyama Rudolf, input as ['Lara', 'Constable'] output is Constable Lara, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
