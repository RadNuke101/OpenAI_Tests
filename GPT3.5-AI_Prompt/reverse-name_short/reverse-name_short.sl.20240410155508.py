Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Summary for Input Column 1 (First Names):
- The first names in the input data are varied and unique, ranging from Launa to Rudolf to Lara.
- There is no apparent pattern or common theme among the first names.

Summary for Input Column 2 (Last Names):
- The last names in the input data are also diverse, including Withers, Edison, Hage, Lango, Akiyama, and Constable.
- Similar to the first names, there is no clear pattern or commonality among the last names.

Summary for Output Column (Last Name First, First Name Last):
- The output column consistently follows the format of displaying the last name first followed by the first name.
- This format is maintained across all input data, indicating a consistent relationship between the input first and last names and the output order.

Relationship between Input and Output:
- The relationship between the input data (first and last names) and the output (last name first, first name last) is that the output consistently displays the last name first followed by the first name.
- This relationship is maintained across all input data, suggesting a systematic approach to arranging the names in the output column.
- The input data does not seem to influence the specific order in which the names are displayed in the output, as the format remains consistent regardless of the input names., and input as ['Launa', 'Withers'] output is Withers Launa, input as ['Lakenya', 'Edison'] output is Edison Lakenya, input as ['Brendan', 'Hage'] output is Hage Brendan, input as ['Bradford', 'Lango'] output is Lango Bradford, input as ['Rudolf', 'Akiyama'] output is Akiyama Rudolf, input as ['Lara', 'Constable'] output is Constable Lara, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
