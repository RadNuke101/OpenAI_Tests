Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Summary for Input Column 1 (First Names):
- The first names in the input data are Launa, Lakenya, Brendan, Bradford, Rudolf, Lara.
- There is no apparent pattern or similarity among the first names.

Summary for Input Column 2 (Last Names):
- The last names in the input data are Withers, Edison, Hage, Lango, Akiyama, Constable.
- There is no clear connection or common theme among the last names.

Summary for Output Column (Full Names):
- The output column combines the last name followed by the first name for each input.
- The output names are Withers Launa, Edison Lakenya, Hage Brendan, Lango Bradford, Akiyama Rudolf, Constable Lara.
- The output names do not follow a specific pattern or relationship based on the input data.

Relationship between Input and Output:
- The output column combines the last name followed by the first name from the input data.
- There is no discernible relationship or pattern between the input first names and last names that determines the order in the output.
- The output seems to simply reverse the order of the input names without any specific logic or connection., and input as ['Launa', 'Withers'] output is Withers Launa, input as ['Lakenya', 'Edison'] output is Edison Lakenya, input as ['Brendan', 'Hage'] output is Hage Brendan, input as ['Bradford', 'Lango'] output is Lango Bradford, input as ['Rudolf', 'Akiyama'] output is Akiyama Rudolf, input as ['Lara', 'Constable'] output is Constable Lara, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
