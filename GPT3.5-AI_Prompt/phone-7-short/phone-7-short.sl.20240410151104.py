Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Summary for Input Column Data:
The input column data consists of phone numbers in the format '+XX YYY-ZZZ-ZZZ', where XX is the country code, YYY is the area code, and ZZZ-ZZZ is the phone number. Each input represents a unique phone number with varying country codes, area codes, and phone numbers.

Summary for Output Column Data:
The output column data consists of the middle three digits of the phone numbers in the input column. These middle three digits vary across the inputs and do not follow a specific pattern based on the country code or area code.

Relationship between Input and Output:
The output column data represents the middle three digits of the phone numbers in the input column. There is no direct relationship between the country code, area code, and the middle three digits of the phone numbers. Each input produces a unique output, indicating that the middle three digits do not depend on the other parts of the phone number., and input as ['+106 769-858-438'] output is 858, input as ['+83 973-757-831'] output is 757, input as ['+62 647-787-775'] output is 787, input as ['+172 027-507-632'] output is 507, input as ['+72 001-050-856'] output is 050, input as ['+95 310-537-401'] output is 537, input as ['+6 775-969-238'] output is 969, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
