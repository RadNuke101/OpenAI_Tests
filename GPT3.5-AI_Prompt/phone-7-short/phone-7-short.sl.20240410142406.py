Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Summary for Input Column Data:
The input column data consists of phone numbers in the format of country code followed by three sets of numbers separated by hyphens. Each set of numbers represents a different part of the phone number. The first set seems to be random, the second set is the one that varies between inputs, and the third set also seems to be random.

Summary for Output Column Data:
The output column data consists of the middle set of numbers from the input phone numbers. This set of numbers varies between inputs and seems to be the focus of attention in the given data.

Relationship between Input and Output:
The relationship between the input and output is that the output is always the middle set of numbers from the input phone numbers. The first and third sets of numbers in the input are not relevant to the output. The middle set of numbers is the key information being extracted from the input data., and input as ['+106 769-858-438'] output is 858, input as ['+83 973-757-831'] output is 757, input as ['+62 647-787-775'] output is 787, input as ['+172 027-507-632'] output is 507, input as ['+72 001-050-856'] output is 050, input as ['+95 310-537-401'] output is 537, input as ['+6 775-969-238'] output is 969, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
