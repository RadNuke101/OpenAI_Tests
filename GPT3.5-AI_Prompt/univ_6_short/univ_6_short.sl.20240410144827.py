Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Summary for Input Column Data:
- The input column data consists of names of universities or colleges along with their locations.
- The locations include city, state, and country information.

Summary for Output Column Data:
- The output column data consists of the locations of the universities or colleges in a standardized format of city, state, and country.
- The output includes the city, state, and country information for each input.

Relationship between Input and Output:
- The input column data provides the names of universities or colleges along with their locations in varying formats.
- The output column standardizes the location information by extracting and displaying the city, state, and country details.
- The relationship between the input and output is that the output column transforms the diverse location formats from the input into a consistent format for easier comparison and analysis., and input as ['University of Pennsylvania', 'Phialdelphia, PA, USA'] output is Phialdelphia, PA, USA, input as ['UCLA', 'Los Angeles, CA'] output is Los Angeles, CA, USA, input as ['Cornell University', 'Ithaca, New York, USA'] output is Ithaca, NY, USA, input as ['Penn', 'Philadelphia, PA, USA'] output is Philadelphia, PA, USA, input as ['University of Maryland College Park', 'College Park, MD'] output is College Park, MD, USA, input as ['University of Michigan', 'Ann Arbor, MI, USA'] output is Ann Arbor, MI, USA, input as ['Columbia University', 'New York, NY, USA'] output is New York, NY, USA, input as ['NYU', 'New York, New York, USA'] output is New York, NY, USA, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.

# Define the generated function

    location_parts = location.split(', ')
    
    # If the country is not included, add 'USA' as default
    if len(location_parts) == 2:
        location_parts.append('USA')
    
    # Format the output as city, state, country
    output = ', '.join(location_parts)
    
    return output
