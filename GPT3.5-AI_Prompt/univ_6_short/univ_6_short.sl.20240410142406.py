Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Summary for Input Column 1 (Qualitative Data):
- The input column 1 consists of various university names such as University of Pennsylvania, UCLA, Cornell University, Penn, University of Maryland College Park, University of Michigan, Columbia University, and NYU.

Summary for Input Column 2 (Qualitative Data):
- The input column 2 consists of locations associated with the universities mentioned, such as Philadelphia, PA, USA, Los Angeles, CA, Ithaca, New York, USA, College Park, MD, Ann Arbor, MI, USA, and New York, NY, USA.

Summary for Output Column (Qualitative Data):
- The output column consists of locations associated with the universities mentioned in the input. The locations include Philadelphia, PA, USA, Los Angeles, CA, Ithaca, NY, USA, College Park, MD, USA, Ann Arbor, MI, USA, and New York, NY, USA.

Relationship between Input and Output:
- The relationship between the input university names and their associated locations in the output column is that each university name corresponds to a specific location. The output provides the location details for each university mentioned in the input, such as city, state, and country. The output column serves as a geographical reference for the universities listed in the input, helping to identify where each university is located., and input as ['University of Pennsylvania', 'Phialdelphia, PA, USA'] output is Phialdelphia, PA, USA, input as ['UCLA', 'Los Angeles, CA'] output is Los Angeles, CA, USA, input as ['Cornell University', 'Ithaca, New York, USA'] output is Ithaca, NY, USA, input as ['Penn', 'Philadelphia, PA, USA'] output is Philadelphia, PA, USA, input as ['University of Maryland College Park', 'College Park, MD'] output is College Park, MD, USA, input as ['University of Michigan', 'Ann Arbor, MI, USA'] output is Ann Arbor, MI, USA, input as ['Columbia University', 'New York, NY, USA'] output is New York, NY, USA, input as ['NYU', 'New York, New York, USA'] output is New York, NY, USA, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
