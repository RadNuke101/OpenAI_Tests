Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Summary for Input Column 1 (Names):
- The input column 1 contains the names of individuals such as Traci Brown, Mary Hannan, and Linda Thomas.

Summary for Input Column 2 (Addresses):
- The input column 2 contains the street addresses of individuals such as 1301 Robinson Court, 1195 Amethyst Drive, and 2479 North Bend Road.

Summary for Input Column 3 (Cities, States, ZIP Codes):
- The input column 3 contains the cities, states, and ZIP codes of individuals such as Saginaw, MI 48607, Lansing, MI 48933, and Allen, KY 41601.

Summary for Output Column (Combined Information):
- The output column combines the information from the input columns to form complete addresses for each individual, including their name, street address, city, state, and ZIP code.

Relationship between Input and Output:
- The input columns provide separate pieces of information (name, address, city/state/ZIP) for each individual, which are combined in the output column to create a full address. The output column serves as a compilation of the input data, organizing it into a coherent format for easy reference., and input as ['Traci Brown', '1301 Robinson Court', 'Saginaw, MI 48607'] output is Traci Brown/n1301 Robinson Court/nSaginaw, MI 48607, input as ['Mary Hannan', '1195 Amethyst Drive', 'Lansing, MI 48933'] output is Mary Hannan/n1195 Amethyst Drive/nLansing, MI 48933, input as ['Linda Thomas', '2479 North Bend Road', 'Allen, KY 41601'] output is Linda Thomas/n2479 North Bend Road/nAllen, KY 41601, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.

# Define the generated function

    # Combine the input information into a complete address
    output = f"{name}\n{address}\n{city_state_zip}"
    
    return output

# Test cases
input1 = ['Traci Brown', '1301 Robinson Court', 'Saginaw, MI 48607']
input2 = ['Mary Hannan', '1195 Amethyst Drive', 'Lansing, MI 48933']
input3 = ['Linda Thomas', '2479 North Bend Road', 'Allen, KY 41601']

# Call the generated function with the test cases
output1 = generated_function(*input1)
output2 = generated_function(*input2)
output3 = generated_function(*input3)
print(generated_function("Traci Brown", "1301 Robinson Court", "Saginaw, MI 48607"))  ## Output: Traci Brown/n1301 Robinson Court/nSaginaw, MI 48607
print(generated_function("Mary Hannan", "1195 Amethyst Drive", "Lansing, MI 48933"))  ## Output: Mary Hannan/n1195 Amethyst Drive/nLansing, MI 48933
print(generated_function("Linda Thomas", "2479 North Bend Road", "Allen, KY 41601"))  ## Output: Linda Thomas/n2479 North Bend Road/nAllen, KY 41601
