Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Summary for Input Column Data:
- The input column data consists of three elements: name, address, and city/state/ZIP code.
- Each element represents a different aspect of a person's contact information.
- The input column data provides specific details about individuals' identities and locations.

Summary for Output Column Data:
- The output column data combines the input elements into a formatted address.
- Each output represents a complete mailing address for an individual.
- The output column data organizes the input elements in a standardized way for mailing purposes.

Relationship between Input and Output:
- The input column data serves as the building blocks for creating the output column data.
- Each input element contributes to forming a complete mailing address in the output.
- The relationship between input and output is one of transformation, where individual details are combined to generate a functional address., and input as ['Traci Brown', '1301 Robinson Court', 'Saginaw, MI 48607'] output is Traci Brown/n1301 Robinson Court/nSaginaw, MI 48607, input as ['Mary Hannan', '1195 Amethyst Drive', 'Lansing, MI 48933'] output is Mary Hannan/n1195 Amethyst Drive/nLansing, MI 48933, input as ['Linda Thomas', '2479 North Bend Road', 'Allen, KY 41601'] output is Linda Thomas/n2479 North Bend Road/nAllen, KY 41601, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.

# Define the generated function
def generated_function(name, address, city_state_zip):
    # Combine the input elements into a formatted address
    output = f"{name}\n{address}\n{city_state_zip}"
    return output

# Test cases
print(generated_function('Traci Brown', '1301 Robinson Court', 'Saginaw, MI 48607'))
print(generated_function('Mary Hannan', '1195 Amethyst Drive', 'Lansing, MI 48933'))
print(generated_function('Linda Thomas', '2479 North Bend Road', 'Allen, KY 41601'))
print(generated_function("Traci Brown", "1301 Robinson Court", "Saginaw, MI 48607"))  ## Output: Traci Brown/n1301 Robinson Court/nSaginaw, MI 48607
print(generated_function("Mary Hannan", "1195 Amethyst Drive", "Lansing, MI 48933"))  ## Output: Mary Hannan/n1195 Amethyst Drive/nLansing, MI 48933
print(generated_function("Linda Thomas", "2479 North Bend Road", "Allen, KY 41601"))  ## Output: Linda Thomas/n2479 North Bend Road/nAllen, KY 41601
