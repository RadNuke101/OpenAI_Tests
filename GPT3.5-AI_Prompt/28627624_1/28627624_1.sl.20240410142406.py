Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: The input column data consists of dates, times, phone numbers, and text (loren ipsum). The output column data consists of dates and times extracted from the input column data. 

The relationship between the input and output columns is that the output column extracts and presents only the date and time information from the input column, ignoring the phone numbers and text. This suggests that the output is a refined version of the input, focusing only on the temporal information provided. 

In summary, the output column serves as a simplified and organized representation of the date and time data present in the input column, filtering out irrelevant information such as phone numbers and text., and input as ['Dec 2, 2014, 11=23 PM - +91 90000 80000= loren ipsum'] output is Dec 2, 2014, 11=23 PM, input as ['Dec 2, 2014, 11=24 PM - +91 90000 80000= loren'] output is Dec 2, 2014, 11=24 PM, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
