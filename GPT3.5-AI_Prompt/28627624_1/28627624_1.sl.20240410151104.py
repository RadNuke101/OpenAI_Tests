Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Based on the provided input data, it appears that the input column contains dates and times in the format 'Month Day, Year, Time', followed by additional text. The output column seems to extract only the date and time information from the input column, discarding the additional text.

The relationship between the input and output columns is that the output column simplifies the information by focusing only on the date and time details provided in the input column. This simplification allows for a clearer and more concise representation of the original data, making it easier to understand and work with.

In summary, the output column provides a refined version of the input data, highlighting the essential date and time information while omitting extraneous text. This relationship enhances the readability and usability of the data for further analysis or processing., and input as ['Dec 2, 2014, 11=23 PM - +91 90000 80000= loren ipsum'] output is Dec 2, 2014, 11=23 PM, input as ['Dec 2, 2014, 11=24 PM - +91 90000 80000= loren'] output is Dec 2, 2014, 11=24 PM, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
