Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Summary for Input Column 1:
- The input column contains information about the place of birth for individuals.
- The data includes locations such as Westerkerk HRL.
- Some entries do not have a place of birth specified.

Summary for Output Column:
- The output column contains the extracted place of birth information from the input data.
- It includes locations such as Westerkerk HRL.
- Some entries are empty, indicating that the place of birth was not provided in the input.

Relationship between Input and Output:
- The output column is derived from the input column by extracting the place of birth information.
- The presence or absence of a place of birth in the input directly affects the content of the output.
- The output provides a consolidated view of the various places of birth mentioned in the input data., and input as ['geb. 14 oct 1956 Westerkerk HRL'] output is Westerkerk HRL, input as ['geb. 14 oct 1956 '] output is , input as ['geb. 15 feb 1987 Westerkerk HRL'] output is Westerkerk HRL, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
