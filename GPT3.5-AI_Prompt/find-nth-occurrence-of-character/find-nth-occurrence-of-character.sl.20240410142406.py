Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Input Column 1 Summary:
The input column consists of qualitative data describing replies to different individuals (_aya, _tasisuke, and _chan). The number of individuals being replied to varies in each input.

Input Column 2 Summary:
The input column consists of qualitative data representing different levels (1, 2, 3) which may indicate the depth or intensity of the replies.

Output Column Summary:
The output column consists of quantitative data representing the total number of replies made based on the input data. The output values increase as the level of replies (input column 2) increases.

Relationship Summary:
The relationship between the input and output columns is that as the level of replies increases (from 1 to 3), the total number of replies also increases. This suggests that the more individuals are being replied to and the deeper the replies, the higher the total number of replies. The specific numbers (12, 18, 33) indicate a pattern of growth in the total number of replies corresponding to the level of replies., and input as ['replies to _aya, _tasisuke, and _chan', '1'] output is 12, input as ['replies to _aya, _tasisuke, and _chan', '2'] output is 18, input as ['replies to _aya, _tasisuke, and _chan', '3'] output is 33, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.

# Define the generated function
def generated_function(input_str, level_str):
    # Convert input and level to integers
    input_num = len(input_str.split(','))
    level = int(level_str)
    
    # Calculate the total number of replies based on the input and level
    if level == 1:
        return input_num * 4
    elif level == 2:
        return input_num * 6
    elif level == 3:
        return input_num * 11

# Test cases
print(generated_function('replies to _aya, _tasisuke, and _chan', '1')) # Output: 12
print(generated_function('replies to _aya, _tasisuke, and _chan', '2')) # Output: 18
print(generated_function('replies to _aya, _tasisuke, and _chan', '3')) # Output: 33
print(generated_function("replies to _aya, _tasisuke, and _chan", "1"))  ## Output: 12
print(generated_function("replies to _aya, _tasisuke, and _chan", "2"))  ## Output: 18
print(generated_function("replies to _aya, _tasisuke, and _chan", "3"))  ## Output: 33
