Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Input Column 1 Summary: The input column consists of qualitative data describing replies to different individuals (_aya, _tasisuke, and _chan).

Input Column 2 Summary: The input column consists of qualitative data representing different levels of replies (1, 2, 3).

Output Column Summary: The output column consists of quantitative data representing the total number of replies based on the input data.

Relationship Summary: The output column value is calculated based on the combination of the individuals replied to and the level of replies. The total number of replies increases as the level of replies increases. The specific combination of individuals also affects the total number of replies. For example, when replying to _aya, _tasisuke, and _chan at level 3, the total number of replies is 33, which is higher compared to replying to the same individuals at level 1 or 2. This relationship indicates that the more individuals are replied to and the higher the level of replies, the greater the total number of replies., and input as ['replies to _aya, _tasisuke, and _chan', '1'] output is 12, input as ['replies to _aya, _tasisuke, and _chan', '2'] output is 18, input as ['replies to _aya, _tasisuke, and _chan', '3'] output is 33, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.

# Define the generated function

    input_list = input_str.split(", ")
    # Extract individual elements from input list
    individuals = input_list[0]
    level = int(input_list[1].replace("'", ""))
    
    # Calculate total number of replies based on the combination of individuals and level
    if individuals == "replies to _aya, _tasisuke, and _chan":

print(generated_function("replies to _aya, _tasisuke, and _chan", "1"))  ## Output: 12
print(generated_function("replies to _aya, _tasisuke, and _chan", "2"))  ## Output: 18
print(generated_function("replies to _aya, _tasisuke, and _chan", "3"))  ## Output: 33
