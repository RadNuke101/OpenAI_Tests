Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Summary for Input Column Data:
- The input column data consists of phone numbers in the format XXX-XXX-XXX.
- Each phone number is unique and does not repeat in the dataset.
- The first three digits of each phone number vary, indicating different area codes.
- The input column data does not follow any specific pattern or sequence.

Summary for Output Column Data:
- The output column data consists of the first three digits of each phone number in the input column.
- The output column data includes a range of three-digit numbers from 118 to 981.
- Each output value corresponds to the first three digits of the respective input phone number.
- The output column data does not follow a specific pattern or sequence.

Relationship between Input and Output:
- The output column data directly corresponds to the first three digits of each phone number in the input column.
- The output value is derived from the input value by extracting the first three digits.
- There is a one-to-one relationship between the input and output data, with each input uniquely mapping to an output.
- The input and output data are related in a straightforward and deterministic manner based on the structure of the phone numbers., and input as ['938-242-504'] output is 938, input as ['308-916-545'] output is 308, input as ['623-599-749'] output is 623, input as ['981-424-843'] output is 981, input as ['118-980-214'] output is 118, input as ['244-655-094'] output is 244, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
