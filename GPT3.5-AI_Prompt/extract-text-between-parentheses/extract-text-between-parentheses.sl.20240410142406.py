Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Summary for Input Column Data:
- The input column data consists of qualitative information in the format 'Jones <number>'. The numbers in the input data represent some kind of attribute or value associated with the name 'Jones'.

Summary for Output Column:
- The output column consists of numerical values ranging from 55 to 60. These values seem to be associated with the input data in some way.

Relationship between Input and Output:
- The output values seem to correspond to the numerical values present in the input data. Each input value is followed by an output value that matches the number in the input. This suggests a direct relationship between the input and output, where the output value is derived from the numerical value in the input data., and input as ['Jones <60>'] output is 60, input as ['Jones <57>'] output is 57, input as ['Jones <55>'] output is 55, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.

# Define the generated function
def generated_function(input_str):
    # Extract the numerical value from the input string
    num = int(input_str.split('<')[-1].strip('>').strip())
    return num

# Test cases
print(generated_function('Jones <60>'))  # Output: 60
print(generated_function('Jones <57>'))  # Output: 57
print(generated_function('Jones <55>'))  # Output: 55
print(generated_function("Jones <60>"))  ## Output: 60
print(generated_function("Jones <57>"))  ## Output: 57
print(generated_function("Jones <55>"))  ## Output: 55
