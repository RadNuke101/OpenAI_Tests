Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Summary for Input Column Data:
- The input column data consists of qualitative information in the format 'Jones <number>'. The numbers in the input data represent some kind of value associated with the name 'Jones'.

Summary for Output Column:
- The output column consists of numerical values that correspond to the numbers in the input data. The output values seem to be directly related to the numbers in the input data.

Relationship between Input and Output:
- The relationship between the input and output data appears to be that the numerical values in the input data directly determine the output values. Each input number corresponds to a specific output value, with no apparent pattern or transformation between the two. The output values simply mirror the input numbers., and input as ['Jones <60>'] output is 60, input as ['Jones <57>'] output is 57, input as ['Jones <55>'] output is 55, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.

# Define the generated function
def generated_function(input_str):
    # Extract the number from the input string
    number = int(input_str.split('<')[1].strip('>').strip())
    
    # Return the extracted number as the output
    return number

# Test cases
print(generated_function('Jones <60>'))  # Output: 60
print(generated_function('Jones <57>'))  # Output: 57
print(generated_function('Jones <55>'))  # Output: 55
print(generated_function("Jones <60>"))  ## Output: 60
print(generated_function("Jones <57>"))  ## Output: 57
print(generated_function("Jones <55>"))  ## Output: 55
