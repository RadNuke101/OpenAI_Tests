Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Summary for Input Column Data:
- The input column data consists of qualitative information in the format 'Jones <number>'. The numbers in the input data represent some kind of attribute or value associated with the name 'Jones'.

Summary for Output Column:
- The output column consists of numerical values ranging from 55 to 60. These numbers seem to be associated with the input data in some way.

Relationship between Input and Output:
- The output column values seem to correspond directly to the numerical values present in the input data. Each input data entry has a corresponding output value that matches the number within the '< >' brackets. The name 'Jones' remains constant across all input data, indicating that the numbers are the key factor influencing the output values., and input as ['Jones <60>'] output is 60, input as ['Jones <57>'] output is 57, input as ['Jones <55>'] output is 55, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.

# Define the generated function
def generated_function(input_str):
    # Split the input string to extract the number
    number = int(input_str.split('<')[1].split('>')[0])
    return number

# Test cases
print(generated_function('Jones <60>')) # Output: 60
print(generated_function('Jones <57>')) # Output: 57
print(generated_function('Jones <55>')) # Output: 55
print(generated_function("Jones <60>"))  ## Output: 60
print(generated_function("Jones <57>"))  ## Output: 57
print(generated_function("Jones <55>"))  ## Output: 55
