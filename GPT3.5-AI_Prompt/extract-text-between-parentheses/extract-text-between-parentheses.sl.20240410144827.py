Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Summary for Input Column Data:
- The input column data consists of qualitative information in the format of 'Jones <number>'. The name 'Jones' is consistent across all entries, indicating a common factor. The numbers following the name vary, suggesting different values associated with each entry.

Summary for Output Column:
- The output column consists of numerical values extracted from the input data. The values range from 60 to 55, indicating a decreasing trend.

Relationship between Input and Output:
- The input data suggests that the name 'Jones' is associated with different numerical values. The output column shows a decreasing trend in the values associated with 'Jones'. This relationship implies that as the input data changes, the corresponding output values decrease., and input as ['Jones <60>'] output is 60, input as ['Jones <57>'] output is 57, input as ['Jones <55>'] output is 55, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.

# Define the generated function
def generated_function(input_str):
    # Extract the numerical value from the input string
    value = int(input_str.split('<')[1].strip('>').strip())
    
    # Return the extracted value
    return value

# Test cases
print(generated_function('Jones <60>'))  # Output: 60
print(generated_function('Jones <57>'))  # Output: 57
print(generated_function('Jones <55>'))  # Output: 55
print(generated_function("Jones <60>"))  ## Output: 60
print(generated_function("Jones <57>"))  ## Output: 57
print(generated_function("Jones <55>"))  ## Output: 55
