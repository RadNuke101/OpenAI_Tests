Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: For the input column data, the summary for each column is as follows:

1. Input column data summary:
   - Column 1: The data in this column consists of strings that represent different levels or categories. Each string represents a unique category.

For the output column data, the summary is as follows:

2. Output column data summary:
   - The output column data consists of numerical values that correspond to the number of levels or categories present in the input data. The numerical value represents the count of categories present in the input data.

Relationship between input and output:
- The relationship between the input column data and the output column is that the numerical value in the output column corresponds to the number of levels or categories present in the input data. Each level or category in the input data is represented by a string, and the output value indicates the total count of unique categories present in the input data., and input as ['one'] output is 1, input as ['one/ntwo'] output is 2, input as ['one/ntwo/nthree'] output is 3, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.

# Define the generated function
def generated_function(*args):
    # Initialize a set to store unique categories
    unique_categories = set()
    
    # Loop through each input argument
    for arg in args:
        # Split the input string by '/' to get individual categories
        categories = arg.split('/')
        
        # Add each category to the set
        for category in categories:
            unique_categories.add(category)
    
    # Return the count of unique categories
    return len(unique_categories)

# Test cases
print(generated_function('one'))  # Output: 1
print(generated_function('one/ntwo'))  # Output: 2
print(generated_function('one/ntwo/nthree'))  # Output: 3
print(generated_function("one"))  ## Output: 1
print(generated_function("one/ntwo"))  ## Output: 2
print(generated_function("one/ntwo/nthree"))  ## Output: 3
