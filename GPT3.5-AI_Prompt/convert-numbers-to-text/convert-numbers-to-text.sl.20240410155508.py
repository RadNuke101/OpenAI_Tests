Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Summary for Input Column Data:
- The input column data consists of qualitative values represented as strings. Each value is unique and does not follow a specific pattern or format.

Summary for Output Column Data:
- The output column data consists of numerical values that correspond to the input values. The output values are the same as the input values but converted to integers.

Relationship between Input and Output:
- The relationship between the input and output is that the input values are qualitative strings, while the output values are the same strings converted to integers. The output values directly correspond to the input values without any transformation or manipulation other than converting them to integers., and input as ['101'] output is 101, input as ['1002'] output is 1002, input as ['743'] output is 743, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.

# Define the generated function
def generated_function(input_str):
    # Convert the input string to an integer and return it
    return int(input_str)

# Test cases
print(generated_function('101'))  # Output: 101
print(generated_function('1002'))  # Output: 1002
print(generated_function('743'))  # Output: 743
print(generated_function("101"))  ## Output: 101
print(generated_function("1002"))  ## Output: 1002
print(generated_function("743"))  ## Output: 743
