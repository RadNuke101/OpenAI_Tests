Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Summary for Input Column Data:
- The input column data consists of strings representing numbers such as '101', '1002', and '743'. These strings are qualitative data and do not have a specific numerical value.

Summary for Output Column Data:
- The output column data consists of numerical values corresponding to the input strings, such as 101, 1002, and 743. These values are quantitative data and represent the converted form of the input strings.

Relationship between Input and Output:
- The relationship between the input and output columns is that the input strings are being converted into numerical values. The output column data directly corresponds to the input data, with each input string being transformed into a numerical output value. This conversion process is consistent and straightforward, with each input string having a unique numerical representation in the output column., and input as ['101'] output is 101, input as ['1002'] output is 1002, input as ['743'] output is 743, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.

# Define the generated function
def generated_function(input_str):
    # Convert the input string to numerical value and return it
    return int(input_str)

# Test cases
print(generated_function('101'))  # Output: 101
print(generated_function('1002'))  # Output: 1002
print(generated_function('743'))  # Output: 743
print(generated_function("101"))  ## Output: 101
print(generated_function("1002"))  ## Output: 1002
print(generated_function("743"))  ## Output: 743
