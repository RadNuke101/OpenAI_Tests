Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Summary for Input Column Data:
- The input column data consists of qualitative values represented as strings.
- The values in the input column data are unique and do not follow a specific pattern or sequence.

Summary for Output Column Data:
- The output column data consists of numerical values.
- The output values correspond directly to the input values, with each input value being converted to its numerical equivalent.

Relationship between Input and Output:
- The relationship between the input and output is a simple conversion of qualitative values to numerical values.
- Each input value is directly translated into its numerical equivalent as the output value.
- There is a one-to-one mapping between the input and output values, with no additional transformations or calculations involved., and input as ['101'] output is 101, input as ['1002'] output is 1002, input as ['743'] output is 743, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.

# Define the generated function
def generated_function(input_str):
    # Convert the input string to numerical value and return
    return int(input_str)

# Test cases
output1 = generated_function('101')
output2 = generated_function('1002')
output3 = generated_function('743')
print(generated_function("101"))  ## Output: 101
print(generated_function("1002"))  ## Output: 1002
print(generated_function("743"))  ## Output: 743
