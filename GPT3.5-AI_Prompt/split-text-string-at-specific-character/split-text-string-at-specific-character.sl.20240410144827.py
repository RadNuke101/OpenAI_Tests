Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: For the input column data:

1. ['011016_assignment.xlsx', '1']:
   - The first element '011016_assignment.xlsx' seems to represent a file name with a date (011016) and a description (assignment.xlsx).
   - The second element '1' does not provide much context on its own.

2. ['030116_cost.xlsx', '1']:
   - The first element '030116_cost.xlsx' seems to represent a file name with a date (030116) and a description (cost.xlsx).
   - The second element '1' does not provide much context on its own.

For the output column data:

1. '011016':
   - This output seems to be extracted from the first element of the input, representing a date (011016).

2. 'assignment.xlsx':
   - This output seems to be extracted from the first element of the input, representing a description or file name.

Relationship between input and output:
- The output column seems to be derived from the first element of the input column, specifically splitting the file name into date and description components.
- The date component from the input is extracted and presented as the output.
- The description component from the input is extracted and presented as the output.
- The second element of the input column does not seem to have a direct relationship with the output column., and input as ['011016_assignment.xlsx', '1'] output is 011016, input as ['011016_assignment.xlsx', '2'] output is assignment.xlsx, input as ['030116_cost.xlsx', '1'] output is 030116, input as ['030116_cost.xlsx', '2'] output is cost.xlsx, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
