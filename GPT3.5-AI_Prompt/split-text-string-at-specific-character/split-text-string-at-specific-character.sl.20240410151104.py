Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Summary for Input Column 1:
- The input column 1 contains dates in the format MMDDYY (e.g., 011016, 030116).
- The data in this column represents dates related to assignments or costs.

Summary for Input Column 2:
- The input column 2 contains text strings representing file names (e.g., assignment.xlsx, cost.xlsx).
- The data in this column represents the type of file associated with the corresponding date in column 1.

Summary for Output Column:
- The output column contains a combination of the date and file type from the input columns.
- The output column shows a relationship between the date and the type of file, with the date being the prefix and the file type being the suffix.

Relationship between Input and Output:
- The output column combines the date from input column 1 with the file type from input column 2.
- This relationship suggests that the specific date is associated with a particular type of file, such as an assignment or a cost document.
- The output column serves as a way to link the date information with the corresponding file type, providing a clear and organized representation of the data., and input as ['011016_assignment.xlsx', '1'] output is 011016, input as ['011016_assignment.xlsx', '2'] output is assignment.xlsx, input as ['030116_cost.xlsx', '1'] output is 030116, input as ['030116_cost.xlsx', '2'] output is cost.xlsx, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.

# Define the generated function
def generated_function(input_str, index):
    # Split the input string into date and file type
    date, file_type = input_str.split('_')
    
    # Return the date or file type based on the index
    if index == '1':
        return date
    elif index == '2':
        return file_type

# Test cases
print(generated_function('011016_assignment.xlsx', '1'))  # Output: 011016
print(generated_function('011016_assignment.xlsx', '2'))  # Output: assignment.xlsx
print(generated_function('030116_cost.xlsx', '1'))  # Output: 030116
print(generated_function('030116_cost.xlsx', '2'))  # Output: cost.xlsx
print(generated_function("011016_assignment.xlsx", "1"))  ## Output: 011016
print(generated_function("011016_assignment.xlsx", "2"))  ## Output: assignment.xlsx
print(generated_function("030116_cost.xlsx", "1"))  ## Output: 030116
print(generated_function("030116_cost.xlsx", "2"))  ## Output: cost.xlsx
