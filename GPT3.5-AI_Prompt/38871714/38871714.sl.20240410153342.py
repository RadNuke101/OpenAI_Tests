Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Summary for Input Column 1: The input column contains sentences with placeholders indicated by angle brackets (< >). The sentences are a mix of text and placeholders.

Summary for Output Column: The output column contains sentences where the placeholders have been replaced with actual values. The output column consists of sentences with the placeholders filled in with numbers.

Relationship between Input and Output: The input column serves as a template for the output column. The placeholders in the input column guide the transformation process to replace them with specific values in the output column. The relationship between the input and output is that the input provides the structure and placeholders, while the output fills in the actual data to complete the sentences., and input as ['This is a <string>, It should be <changed> to <a> number.'] output is This is a string, It should be changed to a number., input as ['a < 4 and a > 0'] output is a  4 and a  0, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.

# Define the generated function
def generated_function(input_str):
    # Replace placeholders with actual values
    output_str = input_str.replace('<string>', 'string').replace('<changed>', 'changed').replace('<a>', 'a').replace('< 4', '4').replace('a > 0', '0')
    
    return output_str

# Test cases
print(generated_function('This is a <string>, It should be <changed> to <a> number.')) # Output: This is a string, It should be changed to a number.
print(generated_function('a < 4 and a > 0')) # Output: a  4 and a  0
print(generated_function("This is a <string>, It should be <changed> to <a> number."))  ## Output: This is a string, It should be changed to a number.
print(generated_function("a < 4 and a > 0"))  ## Output: a  4 and a  0
