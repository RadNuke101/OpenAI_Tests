Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: For the input data provided, each column represents a different qualitative category. The relationship between the input columns and the output column can be summarized as follows:

1. In the first input column, the most common value is '5', appearing twice.
2. In the second input column, the most common value is '0', appearing three times.
3. In the third input column, the most common value is '0', appearing three times.
4. In the fourth input column, the most common value is '5', appearing once.
5. In the fifth input column, the most common value is '0', appearing twice.
6. In the sixth input column, the most common value is '4', appearing twice.

Based on the input data provided, it seems that the output value is most commonly associated with the value '0' in the second and fifth input columns. This suggests a potential relationship between these columns and the output value. Additionally, the input column with the value '4' in the sixth position also appears to have a strong association with the output value.

Overall, the input data suggests that the presence of certain qualitative values in specific input columns may influence the output value. Further analysis and exploration of the data may reveal additional insights into this relationship., and input as ['7 0 0 5 4 4'] output is 3, input as ['0 0 2 3 3 0'] output is 3, input as ['5 6 4 6 0 7'] output is 4, input as ['0 4 5 0 0 2'] output is 2, input as ['3 0 3 0 1 2'] output is 2, input as ['5 3 2 5 6 1'] output is 6, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
