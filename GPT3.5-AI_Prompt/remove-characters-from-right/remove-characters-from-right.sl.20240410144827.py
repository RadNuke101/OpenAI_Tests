Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Summary for Input Column Data:
- The input column data consists of distances in miles, with values such as 736 miles, 1255 miles, 1221 miles, and 790 miles.

Summary for Output Column Data:
- The output column data corresponds to the distances provided in the input column, with values such as 736, 1255, 1221, and 790.

Relationship between Input and Output:
- The input column data represents distances in miles, while the output column data provides the numerical values of those distances. The relationship between the input and output is that the output directly corresponds to the quantitative representation of the distances mentioned in the input. The output serves as a numerical representation of the qualitative distance values provided in the input., and input as ['736 miles'] output is 736, input as ['1255 miles'] output is 1255, input as ['1221 miles'] output is 1221, input as ['790 miles'] output is 790, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.

# Define the generated function
def generated_function(input_str):
    # Remove ' miles' from the input string and convert it to an integer
    input_num = int(input_str.replace(' miles', ''))
    
    # Return the numerical value of the distance
    return input_num

# Test cases
print(generated_function('736 miles'))  # Output: 736
print(generated_function('1255 miles'))  # Output: 1255
print(generated_function('1221 miles'))  # Output: 1221
print(generated_function('790 miles'))  # Output: 790
print(generated_function("736 miles"))  ## Output: 736
print(generated_function("1255 miles"))  ## Output: 1255
print(generated_function("1221 miles"))  ## Output: 1221
print(generated_function("790 miles"))  ## Output: 790
