Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Summary for Input Column Data:
- The input column data consists of phone numbers in the format XXX-XXX-XXX.
- Each phone number is unique and does not repeat within the dataset.
- The numbers in the input column data are qualitative identifiers for different entities.

Summary for Output Column Data:
- The output column data consists of phone numbers in the format XXX.XXX.XXX.
- Each output phone number corresponds to a specific input phone number.
- The output column data is a transformed version of the input column data, where dashes are replaced with dots.

Relationship between Input and Output:
- The relationship between the input and output is a simple transformation of the phone numbers.
- The output is derived from the input by replacing dashes with dots.
- The input and output columns are directly related, with each input phone number corresponding to a specific output phone number., and input as ['938-242-504'] output is 938.242.504, input as ['308-916-545'] output is 308.916.545, input as ['623-599-749'] output is 623.599.749, input as ['981-424-843'] output is 981.424.843, input as ['118-980-214'] output is 118.980.214, input as ['244-655-094'] output is 244.655.094, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
