Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Summary for Input Column Data:
The input column data consists of phone numbers formatted as XXX-XXX-XXX. Each phone number is unique and does not repeat within the dataset. The numbers are randomly generated and do not follow any specific pattern or sequence.

Summary for Output Column Data:
The output column data consists of phone numbers formatted as XXX.XXX.XXX. Each output corresponds to a specific input phone number, with the dashes replaced by periods. The output column directly reflects the input column data, with each input number transformed into the corresponding output number by replacing dashes with periods.

Relationship between Input and Output:
The relationship between the input and output columns is a simple formatting change. The input column contains phone numbers with dashes, while the output column displays the same numbers with dashes replaced by periods. This transformation does not alter the actual phone numbers themselves, only their visual representation. The input and output columns are directly linked, with each input number having a corresponding output number that follows a consistent formatting rule., and input as ['938-242-504'] output is 938.242.504, input as ['308-916-545'] output is 308.916.545, input as ['623-599-749'] output is 623.599.749, input as ['981-424-843'] output is 981.424.843, input as ['118-980-214'] output is 118.980.214, input as ['244-655-094'] output is 244.655.094, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
