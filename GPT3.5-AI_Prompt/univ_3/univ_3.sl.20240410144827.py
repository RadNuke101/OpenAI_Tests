Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Summary for Input Column 1 (Universities):
- The input column consists of various universities such as University of Pennsylvania, UCLA, Cornell University, Penn, University of Maryland College Park, and University of Michigan.

Summary for Input Column 2 (Locations):
- The input column consists of different locations including Philadelphia, PA, USA; Los Angeles, CA; Ithaca, New York, USA; College Park, MD; and Ann Arbor, MI, USA.

Summary for Output Column (Locations):
- The output column includes the locations associated with the universities mentioned in the input column, such as Philadelphia, PA, USA; Los Angeles, CA, USA; Ithaca, New York, USA; College Park, MD, USA; and Ann Arbor, MI, USA.

Relationship between Input and Output:
- The input column data represents various universities along with their respective locations. The output column provides the specific locations associated with each university mentioned in the input. The relationship between the input and output is that the output column directly corresponds to the locations provided for each university in the input column. The output column serves as a reference point to identify the locations of the universities listed in the input column., and input as ['University of Pennsylvania', 'Phialdelphia, PA, USA'] output is Phialdelphia, PA, USA, input as ['UCLA', 'Los Angeles, CA'] output is Los Angeles, CA, USA, input as ['Cornell University', 'Ithaca, New York, USA'] output is Ithaca, New York, USA, input as ['Penn', 'Philadelphia, PA, USA'] output is Philadelphia, PA, USA, input as ['University of Maryland College Park', 'College Park, MD'] output is College Park, MD, USA, input as ['University of Michigan', 'Ann Arbor, MI, USA'] output is Ann Arbor, MI, USA, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.

# Define the generated function
def generated_function(university, location):
    # Return the location associated with the university
    return location

# Test cases
