Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Summary for Input Column Data:
- The input column data consists of URLs related to technology companies and their products.
- The URLs provided are for well-known companies such as Apple and Microsoft.
- Each input represents a specific product or service offered by the company.

Summary for Output Column Data:
- The output column data consists of the specific products or services mentioned in the input URLs.
- The output column includes product names such as "mac," "windows," and "microsoft."

Relationship between Input and Output:
- The input URLs contain information about technology companies and their products.
- The output column extracts the specific product or service mentioned in each input URL.
- The relationship between the input and output is that the input URLs provide context about the company, while the output column identifies the specific product or service being referred to., and input as ['http=//www.apple.com/uk/mac'] output is mac, input as ['https=//www.microsoft.com/en-gb/windows'] output is windows, input as ['https=//www.microsoft.com/'] output is microsoft, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
