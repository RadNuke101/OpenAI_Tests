Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Summary for Input Column Data:
- The input column data consists of URLs related to technology companies and their products.
- Each input contains a URL with the company name and product name or category.
- The input data is qualitative and descriptive, providing information about the company and its products.

Summary for Output Column:
- The output column contains the product names or categories extracted from the input URLs.
- The output column consists of the specific products or categories associated with the technology companies mentioned in the input URLs.
- The output data is qualitative and specific, representing the main focus of each company mentioned in the input URLs.

Relationship between Input and Output:
- The relationship between the input and output is that the input URLs provide information about technology companies and their products, while the output column specifically identifies the product names or categories mentioned in the URLs.
- By analyzing the input URLs, the output column extracts and highlights the key products or categories associated with each company.
- The input and output columns work together to provide a clear picture of the technology companies and their main products or categories., and input as ['http=//www.apple.com/uk/mac'] output is mac, input as ['https=//www.microsoft.com/en-gb/windows'] output is windows, input as ['https=//www.microsoft.com/'] output is microsoft, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
