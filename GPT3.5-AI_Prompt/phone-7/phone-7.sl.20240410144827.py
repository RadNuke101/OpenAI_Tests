Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Summary for Input Column Data:
The input column data consists of phone numbers in the format '+XX YYY-ZZZ-ZZZ', where XX is the country code, YYY is the area code, and ZZZ-ZZZ is the phone number. Each input represents a unique phone number with different country codes, area codes, and phone numbers.

Summary for Output Column Data:
The output column data consists of the middle three digits of the phone numbers from the input column. These middle three digits vary across the input data and are not directly related to the country code or area code.

Relationship between Input and Output:
The output column data (middle three digits of the phone numbers) does not show a direct relationship with the input data (country code, area code, and phone number). The middle three digits seem to be randomly distributed across the input data and do not follow any specific pattern based on the country code or area code. Each input phone number generates a unique output middle three digits, indicating that there is no clear relationship between the input and output in this dataset., and input as ['+106 769-858-438'] output is 858, input as ['+83 973-757-831'] output is 757, input as ['+62 647-787-775'] output is 787, input as ['+172 027-507-632'] output is 507, input as ['+72 001-050-856'] output is 050, input as ['+95 310-537-401'] output is 537, input as ['+6 775-969-238'] output is 969, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
