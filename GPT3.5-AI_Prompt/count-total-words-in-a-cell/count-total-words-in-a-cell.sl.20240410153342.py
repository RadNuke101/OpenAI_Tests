Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Summary for Input Column Data:
- The input column data consists of phrases related to the nursery rhyme "Humpty Dumpty."
- Each input is a complete sentence or phrase related to the nursery rhyme.

Summary for Output Column Data:
- The output column data consists of the number of words in each input phrase.

Relationship between Input and Output:
- The relationship between the input and output is that the output represents the number of words in each input phrase.
- The length of the input phrases varies, leading to different output values.
- The output provides a quantitative measure of the length of each input phrase in terms of the number of words.
- The input phrases are qualitative descriptions related to the nursery rhyme, while the output provides a quantitative measure of their length., and input as ['humpty dumpty'] output is 2, input as ['humpty dumpty sat on a wall,'] output is 6, input as ['couldnt put humpty together again.'] output is 5, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.

# Define the generated function
def generated_function(*args):
    output = []
    for arg in args:
        output.append(len(arg.split()))
    return output

# Test cases
generated_function('humpty dumpty', 'humpty dumpty sat on a wall,', 'couldnt put humpty together again.')
print(generated_function("humpty dumpty"))  ## Output: 2
print(generated_function("humpty dumpty sat on a wall,"))  ## Output: 6
print(generated_function("couldnt put humpty together again."))  ## Output: 5
