Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Summary for Input Column Data:
- The input column data consists of phrases related to the nursery rhyme "Humpty Dumpty."
- Each input is a complete sentence or phrase related to the nursery rhyme.

Summary for Output Column:
- The output column contains the number of words in each input sentence or phrase.

Relationship between Input and Output:
- The relationship between the input and output is that the output represents the number of words in each input sentence or phrase.
- The output is a quantitative representation of the qualitative input data, providing a measure of the length of each input phrase.
- The output serves as a way to quantify and analyze the length of the phrases related to the nursery rhyme "Humpty Dumpty" in the input column data., and input as ['humpty dumpty'] output is 2, input as ['humpty dumpty sat on a wall,'] output is 6, input as ['couldnt put humpty together again.'] output is 5, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
