Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Summary for Input Column Data:
- In the first input column data, the word 'fox' appears twice in the sentence "The fox jumped over the fox".
- In the second input column data, the word 'ox' appears twice in the sentence "The fox jumped over the fox".
- In the third input column data, the word 'Fox' does not appear in the sentence "The fox jumped over the fox".

Summary for Output Column Data:
- The output column data consists of the count of how many times the specified word appears in each sentence.

Relationship between Input and Output:
- The relationship between the input column data and the output is that the output column shows the count of how many times the specified word appears in each sentence from the input column data.
- The output is directly related to the input word provided, showing how many times that word occurs in each sentence., and input as ['The fox jumped over the fox', 'fox'] output is 2, input as ['The fox jumped over the fox', 'ox'] output is 2, input as ['The fox jumped over the fox', 'Fox'] output is 0, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
