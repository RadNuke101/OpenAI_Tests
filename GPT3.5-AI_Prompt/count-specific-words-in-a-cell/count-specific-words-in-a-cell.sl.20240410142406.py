Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Summary for Input Column Data:
- The first input column data consists of sentences containing the phrase "fox" multiple times.
- The second input column data consists of the search term "fox" and "ox" to find occurrences in the sentences.
- The third input column data consists of the search term "fox" and "Fox" to find occurrences in the sentences.

Summary for Output Column Data:
- The output column data shows the number of times the search term appears in each sentence.

Relationship between Input and Output:
- In the first and second input scenarios, the output shows the number of times the search term appears in the sentences.
- In the third input scenario, the search term "Fox" does not match the case of "fox" in the sentences, resulting in an output of 0.
- The relationship between input and output is based on the exact match of the search term in the sentences, with case sensitivity being a factor., and input as ['The fox jumped over the fox', 'fox'] output is 2, input as ['The fox jumped over the fox', 'ox'] output is 2, input as ['The fox jumped over the fox', 'Fox'] output is 0, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.

# Define the generated function
def generated_function(sentence, search_term):
    # Count the number of occurrences of the search term in the sentence
    count = sentence.count(search_term)
    return count

# Test cases
print(generated_function('The fox jumped over the fox', 'fox'))  # Output: 2
print(generated_function('The fox jumped over the fox', 'ox'))  # Output: 2
print(generated_function('The fox jumped over the fox', 'Fox'))  # Output: 0
print(generated_function("The fox jumped over the fox", "fox"))  ## Output: 2
print(generated_function("The fox jumped over the fox", "ox"))  ## Output: 2
print(generated_function("The fox jumped over the fox", "Fox"))  ## Output: 0
