Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Summary for Input Column Data:
- The first input column data consists of sentences containing the phrase "The fox jumped over the fox" and the word "fox".
- The second input column data consists of sentences containing the phrase "The fox jumped over the fox" and the word "ox".
- The third input column data consists of sentences containing the phrase "The fox jumped over the fox" and the word "Fox".

Summary for Output Column Data:
- The output column data shows the frequency of the word "fox" appearing in each input sentence.

Relationship between Input and Output:
- In the first and second input column data, the word "fox" appears twice in each sentence, resulting in an output of 2 for both cases.
- In the third input column data, the word "Fox" does not match the case of "fox" in the input sentence, leading to an output of 0.

Overall, the output column data is directly related to the presence and matching of the word "fox" in the input sentences. The output value reflects the frequency of the word "fox" in each input sentence., and input as ['The fox jumped over the fox', 'fox'] output is 2, input as ['The fox jumped over the fox', 'ox'] output is 2, input as ['The fox jumped over the fox', 'Fox'] output is 0, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.

# Define the generated function
def generated_function(input_str, word):
    # Count the frequency of the word in the input sentence
    return input_str.count(word)

# Test cases
print(generated_function('The fox jumped over the fox', 'fox'))  # Output: 2
print(generated_function('The fox jumped over the fox', 'ox'))   # Output: 2
print(generated_function('The fox jumped over the fox', 'Fox'))  # Output: 0
print(generated_function("The fox jumped over the fox", "fox"))  ## Output: 2
print(generated_function("The fox jumped over the fox", "ox"))  ## Output: 2
print(generated_function("The fox jumped over the fox", "Fox"))  ## Output: 0
