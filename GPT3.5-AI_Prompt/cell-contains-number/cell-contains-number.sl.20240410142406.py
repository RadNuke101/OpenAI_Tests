Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Summary for Input Column Data:
1. The first input column data consists of a common saying about the value of having something certain versus something uncertain.
2. The second input column data is a variation of the first saying, using a numerical representation instead of words.
3. The third input column data is about knowing specific shortcuts.

Summary for Output Column Data:
1. The output column data consists of boolean values, true or false, based on the input column data.

Relationship between Input and Output:
The output column data is determined by whether the input column data follows a specific format or not. In the first and third cases, the output is true because the input data matches the expected format. In the second case, the output is false because the input data deviates from the expected format. The relationship between input and output is based on the adherence to a specific structure or pattern in the input data., and input as ['A bird in the hand is worth 2 in the bush.'] output is true, input as ['A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush.'] output is false, input as ['The 15 shortcuts you simply must know'] output is true, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
