Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Input column data summary:
- The input column data consists of phrases or sentences with various themes such as birds, hands, bushes, shortcuts, and knowledge.

Output column summary:
- The output column consists of boolean values (true or false) indicating whether the input phrase follows a specific pattern or rule.

Relationship between input and output:
- The output is true when the input phrase contains the correct numerical representation of words (e.g., "2" instead of "two") or follows a specific format (e.g., starting with "The" and containing numbers). The output is false when the input phrase does not meet these criteria. The relationship between input and output is based on the correct representation of numerical values and specific patterns within the input phrases., and input as ['A bird in the hand is worth 2 in the bush.'] output is true, input as ['A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush.'] output is false, input as ['The 15 shortcuts you simply must know'] output is true, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
