Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Summary for Input Column Data:
- The input column data consists of phrases describing different scenarios involving colors and objects.
- The phrases vary in length and complexity, but all contain at least one of the colors 'yellow' or 'green' and one object ('dog' in some cases).
- The phrases are not directly related to each other and do not follow a specific pattern.

Summary for Output Column Data:
- The output column data consists of boolean values (true or false) indicating whether the input phrase meets certain criteria.
- The criteria involve the presence of the colors 'yellow' and 'green' as well as the object 'dog' in the input phrase.
- The output column data reflects whether the input phrase contains the specified colors and object.

Relationship between Input and Output:
- The output column data is determined based on whether the input phrase contains the colors 'yellow' and 'green' as well as the object 'dog'.
- If all three criteria are met in the input phrase, the output is true; otherwise, it is false.
- The relationship between the input and output is based on the presence or absence of specific colors and objects in the input phrases.
- The output serves as a filter to identify phrases that match the specified criteria., and input as ['yellow dog on green grass', 'yellow', 'green', 'dog'] output is true, input as ['warm gray sweater', 'yellow', 'green', 'dog'] output is false, input as ['A yellow sun in a green field', 'yellow', 'green', 'dog'] output is true, input as ['yellow neon sign with a green background', 'yellow', 'green', 'dog'] output is true, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.

# Define the generated function
def generated_function(input_str, color1, color2, obj):
    # Check if all three criteria are present in the input string
    if color1 in input_str and color2 in input_str and obj in input_str:
        return True
    else:
        return False

# Test cases
print(generated_function('yellow dog on green grass', 'yellow', 'green', 'dog'))  # Output: True
print(generated_function('warm gray sweater', 'yellow', 'green', 'dog'))  # Output: False
print(generated_function('A yellow sun in a green field', 'yellow', 'green', 'dog'))  # Output: True
print(generated_function('yellow neon sign with a green background', 'yellow', 'green', 'dog'))  # Output: True
print(generated_function("yellow dog on green grass", "yellow", "green", "dog"))  ## Output: true
print(generated_function("warm gray sweater", "yellow", "green", "dog"))  ## Output: false
print(generated_function("A yellow sun in a green field", "yellow", "green", "dog"))  ## Output: true
print(generated_function("yellow neon sign with a green background", "yellow", "green", "dog"))  ## Output: true
