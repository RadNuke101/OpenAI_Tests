Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Summary for Input Column 1 (Qualitative Data):
- The input column 1 contains various fruits such as apples, peaches, and pears with corresponding numbers attached to them.

Summary for Input Column 2 (Qualitative Data):
- The input column 2 contains numbers that seem to be related to the fruits in column 1.

Summary for Output Column (Qualitative Data):
- The output column consists of the names of fruits extracted from the input column 1.

Relationship between Input and Output:
- The output column seems to be derived from the input column 1 by extracting the fruit names and removing any numerical values attached to them. The numbers in input column 2 do not seem to directly influence the output. The output is solely based on the fruit names present in the input column 1., and input as ['apples30', '7'] output is apples, input as ['peaches24', '8'] output is peaches, input as ['peaches0', '8'] output is peaches, input as ['pears', '6'] output is pears, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.

# Define the generated function
def generated_function(input_str):
    # Extract the fruit name from the input string by splitting at the numbers
    fruit_name = ''.join([i for i in input_str if not i.isdigit()])

    return fruit_name

# Test cases
print(generated_function('apples30'))  # Output: apples
print(generated_function('peaches24'))  # Output: peaches
print(generated_function('peaches0'))  # Output: peaches
print(generated_function('pears'))  # Output: pears
print(generated_function("apples30", "7"))  ## Output: apples
print(generated_function("peaches24", "8"))  ## Output: peaches
print(generated_function("peaches0", "8"))  ## Output: peaches
print(generated_function("pears", "6"))  ## Output: pears
