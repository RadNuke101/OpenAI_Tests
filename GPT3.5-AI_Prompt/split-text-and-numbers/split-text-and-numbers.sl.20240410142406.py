Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Summary for Input Column 1:
- The input column contains various fruits with some numerical values attached to them.
- The fruits mentioned in the input column are apples, peaches, and pears.

Summary for Input Column 2:
- The input column contains numerical values ranging from 0 to 30.
- The values in this column seem to represent some quantity or attribute related to the fruits mentioned in the first column.

Summary for Output Column:
- The output column contains the names of fruits without any numerical values attached to them.
- The output column seems to be derived from the input column by removing the numerical values associated with the fruits.

Relationship between Input and Output:
- The output column seems to be derived from the input column by simply extracting the names of the fruits and removing any numerical values attached to them.
- The output column represents the qualitative aspect of the input data, focusing only on the names of the fruits mentioned in the input column.
- The relationship between the input and output columns is that the output column is a refined version of the input column, emphasizing the names of the fruits., and input as ['apples30', '7'] output is apples, input as ['peaches24', '8'] output is peaches, input as ['peaches0', '8'] output is peaches, input as ['pears', '6'] output is pears, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
