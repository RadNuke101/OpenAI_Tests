Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Summary for Input Column Data:
- The input column data consists of the names of various universities or educational institutions along with their locations in the form of city, state, and country.

Summary for Output Column:
- The output column data consists of the locations of the universities or educational institutions in the form of city, state, and country.

Relationship between Input and Output:
- The input column data provides the names of universities or educational institutions along with their locations, while the output column data specifically focuses on extracting and displaying the locations in a standardized format of city, state, and country. The relationship between the input and output is that the output column serves as a standardized representation of the location information provided in the input column. The output column helps in organizing and presenting the location details in a consistent manner, making it easier to understand and compare the locations of different universities or educational institutions., and input as ['University of Pennsylvania', 'Phialdelphia, PA, USA'] output is Phialdelphia, PA, USA, input as ['UCLA', 'Los Angeles, CA'] output is Los Angeles, CA, USA, input as ['Cornell University', 'Ithaca, New York, USA'] output is Ithaca, NY, USA, input as ['Penn', 'Philadelphia, PA, USA'] output is Philadelphia, PA, USA, input as ['University of Maryland College Park', 'College Park, MD'] output is College Park, MD, USA, input as ['University of Michigan', 'Ann Arbor, MI, USA'] output is Ann Arbor, MI, USA, input as ['Columbia University', 'New York, NY, USA'] output is New York, NY, USA, input as ['NYU', 'New York, New York, USA'] output is New York, NY, USA, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.

# Define the generated function

    # Split the location string into city, state, and country
    location_parts = input_location.split(', ')
    city = location_parts[0]
    state = location_parts[1]
    country = location_parts[-1]
    
    # Return the standardized location format
    return f"{city}, {state}, {country}"
