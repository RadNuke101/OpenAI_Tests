Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Summary for Input Column Data:
- The input column data consists of the names of various universities and their corresponding locations in the form of city, state, and country.
- The universities mentioned include University of Pennsylvania, UCLA, Cornell University, Penn, University of Maryland College Park, University of Michigan, Columbia University, and NYU.
- The locations mentioned include Philadelphia, PA, USA; Los Angeles, CA, USA; Ithaca, New York, USA; College Park, MD, USA; Ann Arbor, MI, USA; New York, NY, USA.

Summary for Output Column Data:
- The output column data consists of the locations of the universities mentioned in the input column data.
- The output includes the cities, states, and countries where the universities are located, such as Philadelphia, PA, USA; Los Angeles, CA, USA; Ithaca, NY, USA; College Park, MD, USA; Ann Arbor, MI, USA; New York, NY, USA.

Relationship between Input and Output:
- The relationship between the input and output columns is that the output provides a more concise version of the location information provided in the input.
- The input column data includes the full names of universities along with detailed location information, while the output column data simplifies this information by only including the city, state, and country where each university is located.
- The output column serves as a summary or condensed version of the input column data, providing key location details in a standardized format for easy reference., and input as ['University of Pennsylvania', 'Phialdelphia, PA, USA'] output is Phialdelphia, PA, USA, input as ['UCLA', 'Los Angeles, CA'] output is Los Angeles, CA, USA, input as ['Cornell University', 'Ithaca, New York, USA'] output is Ithaca, NY, USA, input as ['Penn', 'Philadelphia, PA, USA'] output is Philadelphia, PA, USA, input as ['University of Maryland College Park', 'College Park, MD'] output is College Park, MD, USA, input as ['University of Michigan', 'Ann Arbor, MI, USA'] output is Ann Arbor, MI, USA, input as ['Columbia University', 'New York, NY, USA'] output is New York, NY, USA, input as ['NYU', 'New York, New York, USA'] output is New York, NY, USA, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
