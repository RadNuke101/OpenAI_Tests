Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Summary for Input Column Data:
The input column data consists of phone numbers with country codes and three sets of numbers separated by hyphens. Each entry follows the format of '+XX YYY-ZZZ-ZZZ', where XX is the country code, YYY is the area code, and ZZZ-ZZZ is the phone number. The numbers vary in length and do not follow a specific pattern.

Summary for Output Column Data:
The output column data consists of the last set of numbers in each phone number entry. This set represents the specific phone number of the individual. The numbers in this set vary in length and do not follow a specific pattern.

Relationship between Input and Output:
The output column data is directly derived from the input column data. The output represents the specific phone number of each individual, which is the last set of numbers in the phone number entry. There is a clear relationship between the input and output, as the output is a subset of the input data. The input provides the entire phone number, while the output focuses on the specific phone number of each individual., and input as ['+106 769-858-438'] output is 438, input as ['+83 973-757-831'] output is 831, input as ['+62 647-787-775'] output is 775, input as ['+172 027-507-632'] output is 632, input as ['+72 001-050-856'] output is 856, input as ['+95 310-537-401'] output is 401, input as ['+6 775-969-238'] output is 238, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
