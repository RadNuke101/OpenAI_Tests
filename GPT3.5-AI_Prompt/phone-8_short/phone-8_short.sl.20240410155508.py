Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: For the input column data, it appears to consist of phone numbers in a specific format: country code followed by three sets of numbers separated by hyphens. Each input seems to represent a unique phone number. The country code varies in length, and the last set of numbers is the output we are interested in.

As for the output column, it represents the last set of numbers in each input, which seems to be the unique identifier or code we are trying to extract from the phone numbers.

The relationship between the input and output columns is that the output column always corresponds to the last set of numbers in the input column, which is separated by hyphens. The output column seems to be the specific code or identifier we are trying to extract from the phone numbers provided in the input column.

In summary, the input column data consists of phone numbers in a specific format, and the output column represents the unique identifier extracted from the last set of numbers in each input. The relationship between the input and output columns is that the output corresponds to the last set of numbers in the input, serving as a code or identifier., and input as ['+106 769-858-438'] output is 438, input as ['+83 973-757-831'] output is 831, input as ['+62 647-787-775'] output is 775, input as ['+172 027-507-632'] output is 632, input as ['+72 001-050-856'] output is 856, input as ['+95 310-537-401'] output is 401, input as ['+6 775-969-238'] output is 238, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
