Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Summary for Input Column Data:
- The input column data consists of pairs of first and last names.
- The names in the input column data are diverse and unique, ranging from Launa Withers to Rudolf Akiyama.

Summary for Output Column:
- The output column consists of full names formed by combining the first and last names from the input column.
- The output column showcases the combination of diverse first and last names, resulting in unique full names such as Launa Withers and Rudolf Akiyama.

Relationship between Input and Output:
- The input column data provides the individual components (first and last names) that are combined to form the full names in the output column.
- By combining the first and last names from the input column, the output column creates distinct and complete identities for each individual.
- The relationship between the input and output columns highlights the process of combining separate elements to form a cohesive whole, reflecting the importance of individual components in creating a unified outcome., and input as ['Launa', 'Withers'] output is Launa Withers, input as ['Lakenya', 'Edison'] output is Lakenya Edison, input as ['Brendan', 'Hage'] output is Brendan Hage, input as ['Bradford', 'Lango'] output is Bradford Lango, input as ['Rudolf', 'Akiyama'] output is Rudolf Akiyama, input as ['Lara', 'Constable'] output is Lara Constable, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
