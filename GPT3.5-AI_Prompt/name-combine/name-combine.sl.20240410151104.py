Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Summary for Input Column 1 (First Names):
- The first names in the input column include Launa, Lakenya, Brendan, Bradford, Rudolf, and Lara.

Summary for Input Column 2 (Last Names):
- The last names in the input column include Withers, Edison, Hage, Lango, Akiyama, and Constable.

Summary for Output Column (Full Names):
- The output column consists of full names formed by combining the first and last names from the input columns.

Relationship between Input and Output:
- The input columns contain first names and last names, which are combined to form full names in the output column. Each row in the output column represents a unique individual with a combination of the first and last names provided in the input columns. The relationship between the input and output is that the input data is used to create the output data by merging the first and last names., and input as ['Launa', 'Withers'] output is Launa Withers, input as ['Lakenya', 'Edison'] output is Lakenya Edison, input as ['Brendan', 'Hage'] output is Brendan Hage, input as ['Bradford', 'Lango'] output is Bradford Lango, input as ['Rudolf', 'Akiyama'] output is Rudolf Akiyama, input as ['Lara', 'Constable'] output is Lara Constable, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
