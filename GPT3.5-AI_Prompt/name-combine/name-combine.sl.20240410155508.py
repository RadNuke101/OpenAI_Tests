Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Summary for Input Column 1 (First Names):
The first names in the input data are diverse and unique, ranging from traditional names like "Bradford" and "Rudolf" to more modern names like "Lakenya" and "Launa". Each name has its own distinct sound and origin, adding variety to the dataset.

Summary for Input Column 2 (Last Names):
The last names in the input data are also varied, with surnames like "Constable" and "Akiyama" representing different cultural backgrounds and histories. Some last names are more common, while others are less frequently encountered, contributing to the overall diversity of the dataset.

Summary for Output Column (Full Names):
The output column combines the first and last names from the input data to create unique full names like "Launa Withers" and "Rudolf Akiyama". The combination of different first and last names results in a set of distinct and individual identities, showcasing the diversity and richness of human names. Each full name represents a unique individual with their own story and background, highlighting the personal and cultural significance of names., and input as ['Launa', 'Withers'] output is Launa Withers, input as ['Lakenya', 'Edison'] output is Lakenya Edison, input as ['Brendan', 'Hage'] output is Brendan Hage, input as ['Bradford', 'Lango'] output is Bradford Lango, input as ['Rudolf', 'Akiyama'] output is Rudolf Akiyama, input as ['Lara', 'Constable'] output is Lara Constable, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
