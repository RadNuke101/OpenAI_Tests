Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Summary for Input Column 1: 
- In the first input column, the most common value is 'cat', appearing twice out of three total values. 
- The second most common value is 'dog', appearing once out of three total values. 

Summary for Input Column 2:
- In the second input column, the most common value is 'red', appearing twice out of three total values. 
- The second most common value is 'blue', appearing once out of three total values. 

Summary for Input Column 3:
- In the third input column, the most common value is 'soft', appearing twice out of three total values. 
- The second most common value is 'firm', appearing once out of three total values. 

Summary for Output Column:
- In the output column, the most common value is 'cat', 'red', and 'soft', each appearing once out of three total values. 

Relationship between Input and Output:
- Based on the provided data, it seems that the output value is most likely to be the same as the most common value in the input columns. 
- For example, when 'cat' is the most common value in the input column, the output is 'cat'. 
- This suggests a direct relationship between the input and output values, where the output is determined by the most common value in the input columns., and input as ['cat', 'dog', 'cat'] output is cat, input as ['blue', 'red', 'red'] output is red, input as ['firm', 'firm', 'soft'] output is firm, input as ['soft', 'soft', 'soft'] output is soft, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.

        return most_common3

# Test cases
generated_function('cat', 'red', 'soft')  # Output: 'cat'
generated_function('dog', 'red', 'soft')  # Output: 'red'
generated_function('cat', 'blue', 'soft')  # Output: 'soft'
generated_function('cat', 'red', 'soft')  # Output: 'cat'
print(generated_function("cat", "dog", "cat"))  ## Output: cat
print(generated_function("blue", "red", "red"))  ## Output: red
print(generated_function("firm", "firm", "soft"))  ## Output: firm
print(generated_function("soft", "soft", "soft"))  ## Output: soft
