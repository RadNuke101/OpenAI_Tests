Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: For the input columns, the summary for each column is as follows:

1. ['cat', 'dog', 'cat']: The most common value in this column is 'cat', which appears twice. The other value is 'dog'.

2. ['blue', 'red', 'red']: The most common value in this column is 'red', which appears twice. The other value is 'blue'.

3. ['firm', 'firm', 'soft']: The most common value in this column is 'firm', which appears twice. The other value is 'soft'.

4. ['soft', 'soft', 'soft']: The only value in this column is 'soft', which appears three times.

For the output column, the summary is as follows:

- The most common output value is 'soft', which appears once. The other output values are 'cat', 'red', and 'firm', each appearing once.

Based on the input and output data provided, it seems that the output value is determined by the most common value in the input column. In other words, the output value is likely to be the value that appears most frequently in the input column. This relationship suggests that there may be a pattern or rule that associates certain input values with specific output values., and input as ['cat', 'dog', 'cat'] output is cat, input as ['blue', 'red', 'red'] output is red, input as ['firm', 'firm', 'soft'] output is firm, input as ['soft', 'soft', 'soft'] output is soft, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
