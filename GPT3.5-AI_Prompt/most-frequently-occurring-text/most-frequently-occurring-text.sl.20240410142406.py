Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: For the input columns, the summary for each column is as follows:

1. ['cat', 'dog', 'cat']: The most common value in this column is 'cat', which appears twice. The other value is 'dog'.

2. ['blue', 'red', 'red']: The most common value in this column is 'red', which appears twice. The other value is 'blue'.

3. ['firm', 'firm', 'soft']: The most common value in this column is 'firm', which appears twice. The other value is 'soft'.

4. ['soft', 'soft', 'soft']: The only value in this column is 'soft', which appears three times.

For the output column, the summary is as follows:

- The most common value in the output column is 'cat', 'red', 'firm', or 'soft', depending on the input data. This suggests that the output is directly related to the most common value in the input column. In other words, the output tends to be the same as the most common value in the input column.

Overall, the relationship between the input and output columns seems to be that the output is determined by the most common value in the input column. This suggests a clear pattern or rule that links the input and output data., and input as ['cat', 'dog', 'cat'] output is cat, input as ['blue', 'red', 'red'] output is red, input as ['firm', 'firm', 'soft'] output is firm, input as ['soft', 'soft', 'soft'] output is soft, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
