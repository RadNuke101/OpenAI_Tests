Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Summary for Input Column Data:
- The input column data consists of dates in the format MM/DD/YYYY.
- Each date represents a specific point in time.

Summary for Output Column Data:
- The output column data consists of dates in the format MM/YYYY.
- Each output date represents a month and year.

Relationship between Input and Output:
- The output column data is derived from the input column data by removing the day component from the date.
- The relationship between the input and output is that the output provides a more generalized view of the input data by focusing on the month and year only.
- This relationship allows for a simpler and more concise representation of the original input dates., and input as ['01/15/2013'] output is 01/2013, input as ['03/07/2011'] output is 03/2011, input as ['05/09/2009'] output is 05/2009, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.

# Define the generated function
def generated_function(input_date):
    # Split the input date into month, day, and year components
    month, day, year = input_date.split('/')
    
    # Create the output date by keeping only the month and year components
    output_date = f"{month}/{year}"
    
    return output_date

# Test cases
print(generated_function('01/15/2013')) # Output: 01/2013
print(generated_function('03/07/2011')) # Output: 03/2011
print(generated_function('05/09/2009')) # Output: 05/2009
print(generated_function("01/15/2013"))  ## Output: 01/2013
print(generated_function("03/07/2011"))  ## Output: 03/2011
print(generated_function("05/09/2009"))  ## Output: 05/2009
