Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Summary for Input Column 1 (First Names):
- The first names in the input column are diverse and unique, including names like Launa, Lakenya, Brendan, Bradford, Rudolf, and Lara.

Summary for Input Column 2 (Last Names):
- The last names in the input column are also varied, with names like Withers, Edison, Hage, Lango, Akiyama, and Constable.

Summary for Output Column (Last Name First, First Name Last):
- The output column consistently follows the format of Last Name First, First Name Last for each pair of names provided. This format is maintained across all input examples.

Relationship between Input and Output:
- The relationship between the input and output is that the last name from the input is placed first in the output, followed by a space, and then the first name from the input. This consistent pattern is followed for all input examples, indicating a clear and predictable relationship between the input data and the output format., and input as ['Launa', 'Withers'] output is Withers Launa, input as ['Lakenya', 'Edison'] output is Edison Lakenya, input as ['Brendan', 'Hage'] output is Hage Brendan, input as ['Bradford', 'Lango'] output is Lango Bradford, input as ['Rudolf', 'Akiyama'] output is Akiyama Rudolf, input as ['Lara', 'Constable'] output is Constable Lara, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.

    # Concatenate the last name first followed by a space and then the first name
    output = last_name + ' ' + first_name
