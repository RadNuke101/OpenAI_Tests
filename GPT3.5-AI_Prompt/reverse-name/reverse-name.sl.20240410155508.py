Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Summary for Input Column 1 (First Names):
The first names in the input data are diverse and unique, ranging from Launa to Rudolf to Lakenya. There is no apparent pattern or common theme among the first names.

Summary for Input Column 2 (Last Names):
Similarly, the last names in the input data are varied, including Withers, Edison, Hage, and Constable. There is no clear connection or similarity between the last names.

Summary for Output Column (Full Names):
The output column combines the first and last names in reverse order (Last Name First Name). This pattern is consistent across all input data, indicating that the relationship between the input and output is that the last name always comes before the first name in the output. This suggests a specific formatting or naming convention being followed in generating the output., and input as ['Launa', 'Withers'] output is Withers Launa, input as ['Lakenya', 'Edison'] output is Edison Lakenya, input as ['Brendan', 'Hage'] output is Hage Brendan, input as ['Bradford', 'Lango'] output is Lango Bradford, input as ['Rudolf', 'Akiyama'] output is Akiyama Rudolf, input as ['Lara', 'Constable'] output is Constable Lara, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
