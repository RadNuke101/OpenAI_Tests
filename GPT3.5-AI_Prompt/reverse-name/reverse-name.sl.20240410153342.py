Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Summary for Input Column Data:
- The input column data consists of pairs of first and last names.
- The names in the input column data are diverse and varied, ranging from traditional to more unique names.
- Each pair of names in the input column data is distinct and does not follow a specific pattern or theme.

Summary for Output Column Data:
- The output column data consists of the last names followed by the first names from the input column data.
- The output column data follows a consistent pattern of last name first, followed by first name.
- The output column data effectively reverses the order of the names from the input column data.

Relationship between Input and Output:
- The relationship between the input and output columns is that the output column rearranges the order of the names from the input column.
- The output column consistently places the last name before the first name, creating a reversed version of the original input data.
- The output column serves as a mirror image of the input column, showcasing the names in a different order., and input as ['Launa', 'Withers'] output is Withers Launa, input as ['Lakenya', 'Edison'] output is Edison Lakenya, input as ['Brendan', 'Hage'] output is Hage Brendan, input as ['Bradford', 'Lango'] output is Lango Bradford, input as ['Rudolf', 'Akiyama'] output is Akiyama Rudolf, input as ['Lara', 'Constable'] output is Constable Lara, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.

# Define the generated function

    # Rearrange the names and return the output
    return last_name + ' ' + first_name

# Test cases

print(generated_function("Launa", "Withers"))  ## Output: Withers Launa
print(generated_function("Lakenya", "Edison"))  ## Output: Edison Lakenya
print(generated_function("Brendan", "Hage"))  ## Output: Hage Brendan
print(generated_function("Bradford", "Lango"))  ## Output: Lango Bradford
print(generated_function("Rudolf", "Akiyama"))  ## Output: Akiyama Rudolf
