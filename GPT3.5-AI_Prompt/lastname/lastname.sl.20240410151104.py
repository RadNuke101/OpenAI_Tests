Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Summary for Input Column Data:
- The input column data consists of full names of individuals.
- Each name is unique and represents a person's first and last name.
- The names do not follow a specific pattern or format.

Summary for Output Column Data:
- The output column consists of last names extracted from the input full names.
- The last names vary in length and structure.
- The last names are diverse and do not follow a specific pattern.

Relationship between Input and Output:
- The output column data is derived from the last names of the individuals in the input column.
- The last names in the output column are extracted from the corresponding full names in the input column.
- The relationship between the input and output is that the last names in the output column are a subset of the full names in the input column.
- The output column serves as a simplified version of the input column, focusing only on the last names of the individuals., and input as ['Nancy FreeHafer'] output is FreeHafer, input as ['Andrew Cencici'] output is Cencici, input as ['Jan Kotas'] output is Kotas, input as ['Mariya Sergienko'] output is Sergienko, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.

# Define the generated function
def generated_function(*names):
    # Initialize an empty list to store the extracted last names
    last_names = []
    
    # Iterate through each input name
    for name in names:
        # Split the full name into first and last name
        first_name, last_name = name.split(' ')
        # Append the extracted last name to the list
        last_names.append(last_name)
    
    # Return the list of extracted last names
    return last_names

# Test cases
generated_function('Nancy FreeHafer', 'Andrew Cencici', 'Jan Kotas', 'Mariya Sergienko')
print(generated_function("Nancy FreeHafer"))  ## Output: FreeHafer
print(generated_function("Andrew Cencici"))  ## Output: Cencici
print(generated_function("Jan Kotas"))  ## Output: Kotas
print(generated_function("Mariya Sergienko"))  ## Output: Sergienko
