Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Summary for Input Column 1: The input column consists of a famous quote "you can do anything but you can't do everything." Each input represents a word from the quote.

Summary for Input Column 2: The input column consists of numbers ranging from 1 to 4, each representing a position in the quote.

Summary for Output Column: The output column represents the word at the specified position in the quote.

Relationship between Input and Output: The input column provides the words from a quote, and the output column specifies the position of the word in the quote. The relationship between the input and output is that the output column displays the word at the specified position in the quote provided in the input column. The assistant helps in identifying specific words from the quote based on the position mentioned in the input., and input as ['you can do anything but you cant do everything.', '4'] output is anything, input as ['you can do anything but you cant do everything.', '1'] output is you, input as ['you can do anything but you cant do everything.', '2'] output is can, input as ['you can do anything but you cant do everything.', '3'] output is do, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
