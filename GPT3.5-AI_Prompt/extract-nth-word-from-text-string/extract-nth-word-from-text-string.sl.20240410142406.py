Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Summary for Input Column 1: The input column consists of a famous quote: "You can do anything but you can't do everything." Each phrase in the quote emphasizes the idea of possibilities and limitations.

Summary for Input Column 2: The input column consists of numbers ranging from 1 to 4, indicating the position of the word to be extracted from the quote in Input Column 1.

Summary for Output Column: The output column consists of individual words extracted from the quote in Input Column 1 based on the corresponding number in Input Column 2.

Relationship Summary: The relationship between the input columns and the output column is that the numbers in Input Column 2 determine which word from the quote in Input Column 1 should be extracted. The output column provides a selection of words from the quote, showcasing the variety of possibilities within the limitations mentioned in the quote. This relationship highlights the importance of making choices and prioritizing tasks in order to achieve goals effectively., and input as ['you can do anything but you cant do everything.', '4'] output is anything, input as ['you can do anything but you cant do everything.', '1'] output is you, input as ['you can do anything but you cant do everything.', '2'] output is can, input as ['you can do anything but you cant do everything.', '3'] output is do, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.

    input_list = input_str.split()

    # Extract the word based on the number provided
    output = input_list[num - 1]
