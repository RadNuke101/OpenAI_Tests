Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Summary for Input Column 1 (First Names):
- The first names in the input column are varied and unique, ranging from Launa to Rudolf to Lara.
- There is no apparent pattern or trend in the first names provided.

Summary for Input Column 2 (Last Names):
- The last names in the input column are diverse, including Withers, Edison, Hage, Lango, Akiyama, and Constable.
- There is no clear connection or similarity between the last names provided.

Summary for Output Column (Formatted Names):
- The output column consists of formatted names with the first initial followed by a period and the last name.
- The formatting consistently follows the pattern of initial period last name (e.g., L. Withers, B. Hage).

Relationship between Input and Output:
- The output column combines the first initial of the first name with the last name from the input columns.
- The formatting of the output column is consistent and follows a specific pattern.
- There is a direct relationship between the input first names and last names, as they are combined to create the formatted names in the output column., and input as ['Launa', 'Withers'] output is L. Withers, input as ['Lakenya', 'Edison'] output is L. Edison, input as ['Brendan', 'Hage'] output is B. Hage, input as ['Bradford', 'Lango'] output is B. Lango, input as ['Rudolf', 'Akiyama'] output is R. Akiyama, input as ['Lara', 'Constable'] output is L. Constable, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
