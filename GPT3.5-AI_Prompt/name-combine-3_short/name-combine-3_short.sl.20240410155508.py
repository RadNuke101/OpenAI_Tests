Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Summary for Input Column Data:
- The input column data consists of pairs of first and last names.
- The first names in the input column data vary in length and uniqueness.
- The last names in the input column data also vary in length and uniqueness.

Summary for Output Column Data:
- The output column data consists of a single initial followed by a last name.
- The initials in the output column data correspond to the first names in the input column data.
- The last names in the output column data are the same as the last names in the input column data.

Relationship between Input and Output:
- The output column data combines the initial of the first name from the input with the last name from the input.
- The output column data provides a concise representation of the input column data by using the initial of the first name.
- The output column data maintains the connection between the first and last names from the input column data., and input as ['Launa', 'Withers'] output is L. Withers, input as ['Lakenya', 'Edison'] output is L. Edison, input as ['Brendan', 'Hage'] output is B. Hage, input as ['Bradford', 'Lango'] output is B. Lango, input as ['Rudolf', 'Akiyama'] output is R. Akiyama, input as ['Lara', 'Constable'] output is L. Constable, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
