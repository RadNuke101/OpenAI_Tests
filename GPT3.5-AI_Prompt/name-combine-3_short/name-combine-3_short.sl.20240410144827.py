Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Summary for Input Column Data:
- The first names in the input column data are varied and diverse, ranging from Launa to Rudolf to Lara.
- The last names in the input column data are also diverse, including Withers, Edison, Hage, Lango, Akiyama, and Constable.
- Each input pair consists of a first name and a last name, creating a combination of unique names.

Summary for Output Column Data:
- The output column consists of a combination of the first initial of the first name and the last name, separated by a period.
- The output format consistently follows the pattern of "First Initial. Last Name" for each input pair.

Relationship between Input and Output:
- The output column combines the first initial of the first name with the last name from the input column.
- The output column maintains the original last name while simplifying the first name to just the initial, creating a concise and standardized format.
- The relationship between the input and output is a transformation that condenses the first name while preserving the last name, resulting in a clear and structured representation of the input data., and input as ['Launa', 'Withers'] output is L. Withers, input as ['Lakenya', 'Edison'] output is L. Edison, input as ['Brendan', 'Hage'] output is B. Hage, input as ['Bradford', 'Lango'] output is B. Lango, input as ['Rudolf', 'Akiyama'] output is R. Akiyama, input as ['Lara', 'Constable'] output is L. Constable, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
