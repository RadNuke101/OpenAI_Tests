Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Summary for Input Column 1 (First Names):
- The first names in the input column are varied and unique, ranging from Launa to Rudolf to Lara.
- There is no clear pattern or trend in the first names provided.

Summary for Input Column 2 (Last Names):
- The last names in the input column are diverse, including Withers, Edison, Hage, Lango, Akiyama, and Constable.
- There is no apparent connection or similarity between the last names.

Summary for Output Column (Full Names):
- The output column consists of the first initial of the first name followed by the last name, such as L. Withers or R. Akiyama.
- The output format consistently follows the pattern of initial period last name.

Relationship between Input and Output:
- The output column combines the first initial of the first name with the last name to create a new formatted full name.
- The relationship between the input and output is that the first initial of the first name is used in conjunction with the last name to generate the final output.
- The output column provides a standardized format for presenting the full names based on the input data., and input as ['Launa', 'Withers'] output is L. Withers, input as ['Lakenya', 'Edison'] output is L. Edison, input as ['Brendan', 'Hage'] output is B. Hage, input as ['Bradford', 'Lango'] output is B. Lango, input as ['Rudolf', 'Akiyama'] output is R. Akiyama, input as ['Lara', 'Constable'] output is L. Constable, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
