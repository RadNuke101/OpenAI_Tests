Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Summary for Input Column 1 (First Names):
- The first names in the input column are varied and diverse, ranging from Launa to Rudolf to Lara.
- There is no apparent pattern or common theme among the first names.

Summary for Input Column 2 (Last Names):
- The last names in the input column are also diverse, including Withers, Edison, Hage, Lango, Akiyama, and Constable.
- Similar to the first names, there is no clear pattern or commonality among the last names.

Summary for Output Column (Formatted Names):
- The output column consistently follows the format of initial of the first name followed by a period and the last name.
- This format creates a sense of formality and professionalism in the output names.

Relationship between Input and Output:
- The relationship between the input and output is that the initial of the first name is used in the output, followed by a period and the last name.
- This relationship creates a standardized and consistent format for the output names, regardless of the variation in the input first names and last names.
- The use of the initial of the first name in the output adds a personal touch while maintaining a professional appearance., and input as ['Launa', 'Withers'] output is L. Withers, input as ['Lakenya', 'Edison'] output is L. Edison, input as ['Brendan', 'Hage'] output is B. Hage, input as ['Bradford', 'Lango'] output is B. Lango, input as ['Rudolf', 'Akiyama'] output is R. Akiyama, input as ['Lara', 'Constable'] output is L. Constable, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.

# Define the generated function

    initial = first_name[0]
    # Format the output with the initial and last name
    formatted_name = initial + '. ' + last_name
    return formatted_name
