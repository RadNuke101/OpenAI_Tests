Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Summary for Input Column Data:
- The input column data consists of URLs in the format 'protocol=//domain/path'.
- Each URL contains a protocol (http or https), a domain, and a path.
- The URLs vary in terms of the domain and path specified.

Summary for Output Column Data:
- The output column data consists of URLs in the format 'protocol=//domain'.
- The output URLs only include the protocol and domain, excluding the path.

Relationship between Input and Output:
- The relationship between the input and output is that the output column data is derived from the input column data by removing the path component from the URLs.
- The output URLs provide a more generalized view of the original URLs by focusing on the protocol and domain only, without considering the specific paths.
- This transformation simplifies the URLs and may be useful for certain analysis or categorization purposes., and input as ['https=//abc.com/def'] output is https=//abc.com/, input as ['http=//www.abc.com/def/cef'] output is http=//www.abc.com, input as ['http=//chandoo.org/wp/def-def'] output is http=//chandoo.org/, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.

# Define the python function
def generated_function(input_str):
    # Split the input string into protocol, domain, and path
    protocol, rest = input_str.split('=')
    domain, path = rest.split('/', 1)
    
    # Generate the output URL with protocol and domain only
    output_str = f"{protocol}={domain}/"
    
    return output_str

# Test cases
print(generated_function('https=//abc.com/def'))  # Output: https=//abc.com/
print(generated_function('http=//www.abc.com/def/cef'))  # Output: http=//www.abc.com
print(generated_function('http=//chandoo.org/wp/def-def'))  # Output: http=//chandoo.org/
print(generated_function("https=//abc.com/def"))  ## Output: https=//abc.com/
print(generated_function("http=//www.abc.com/def/cef"))  ## Output: http=//www.abc.com
print(generated_function("http=//chandoo.org/wp/def-def"))  ## Output: http=//chandoo.org/
