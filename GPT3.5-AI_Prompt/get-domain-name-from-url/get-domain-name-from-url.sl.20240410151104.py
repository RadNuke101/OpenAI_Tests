Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Summary for Input Column Data:
- The input column data consists of URLs in the format 'protocol=//domain/path'.
- Each input represents a different website URL with varying protocols, domains, and paths.

Summary for Output Column:
- The output column consists of the domain and protocol extracted from the input URLs.
- The output only includes the protocol and domain of the original URLs, excluding the path.

Relationship between Input and Output:
- The output column provides a simplified version of the input URLs by extracting only the protocol and domain.
- The relationship between the input and output is that the output column condenses the information from the input URLs to focus on the essential elements of protocol and domain., and input as ['https=//abc.com/def'] output is https=//abc.com/, input as ['http=//www.abc.com/def/cef'] output is http=//www.abc.com, input as ['http=//chandoo.org/wp/def-def'] output is http=//chandoo.org/, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.

    domain = '/'.join(domain_path.split('/')[:2])
    
    # Return the extracted protocol and domain
