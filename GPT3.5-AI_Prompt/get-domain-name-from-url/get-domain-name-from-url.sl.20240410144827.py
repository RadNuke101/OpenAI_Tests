Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Summary for Input Column Data:
- The input column data consists of URLs in the format of protocol=//domain/path.
- Each URL in the input column data follows a similar structure with variations in the domain and path.

Summary for Output Column Data:
- The output column data consists of URLs with the protocol and domain extracted from the corresponding input URLs.
- The output URLs retain the protocol and domain from the input URLs while removing the path component.

Relationship between Input and Output:
- The relationship between the input and output is that the output URLs are derived from the input URLs by extracting the protocol and domain components while excluding the path component.
- The output URLs serve as a simplified version of the input URLs, focusing on the essential protocol and domain information.
- This process of extracting and simplifying the URLs helps in creating a more concise and structured representation of the original URLs., and input as ['https=//abc.com/def'] output is https=//abc.com/, input as ['http=//www.abc.com/def/cef'] output is http=//www.abc.com, input as ['http=//chandoo.org/wp/def-def'] output is http=//chandoo.org/, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
