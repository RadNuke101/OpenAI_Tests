Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Summary for Input Column Data:
- The input column data consists of different motorcycle brands followed by their engine sizes, such as Ducati100, Honda125, Ducati250, Honda250, Honda550, and Ducati125.
- The input data primarily includes two motorcycle brands: Ducati and Honda, with engine sizes ranging from 100 to 550.
- The input data does not follow a consistent pattern in terms of engine sizes or brand order.

Summary for Output Column Data:
- The output column data consists of the motorcycle brands extracted from the input data, such as Ducati, Honda, Ducati, Honda, Honda, and Ducati.
- The output column data reflects the motorcycle brands mentioned in the input data without the engine sizes.

Relationship between Input and Output:
- The relationship between the input and output data is that the output column represents only the motorcycle brands extracted from the input data, excluding the engine sizes.
- The output column serves as a simplified version of the input data, focusing solely on the motorcycle brands mentioned.
- The output column provides a clear indication of the predominant motorcycle brands present in the input data, which are Ducati and Honda., and input as ['Ducati100'] output is Ducati, input as ['Honda125'] output is Honda, input as ['Ducati250'] output is Ducati, input as ['Honda250'] output is Honda, input as ['Honda550'] output is Honda, input as ['Ducati125'] output is Ducati, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.

    # Extract the motorcycle brand from the input string
    brand = input_str.split(' ')[0]
    return brand

# Test cases
print(generated_function('Ducati100'))  # Output: Ducati
print(generated_function('Honda125'))   # Output: Honda
print(generated_function('Ducati250'))  # Output: Ducati
print(generated_function('Honda250'))   # Output: Honda
print(generated_function('Honda550'))   # Output: Honda
print(generated_function('Ducati125'))  # Output: Ducati
print(generated_function("Ducati100"))  ## Output: Ducati
print(generated_function("Honda125"))  ## Output: Honda
print(generated_function("Ducati250"))  ## Output: Ducati
print(generated_function("Honda250"))  ## Output: Honda
print(generated_function("Honda550"))  ## Output: Honda
print(generated_function("Ducati125"))  ## Output: Ducati
