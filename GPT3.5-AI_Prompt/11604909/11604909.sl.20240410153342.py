Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Summary for Input Column Data:
1. ['AIX 5.1']: The input data consists of an operating system name followed by a version number. The version number in this case is 5.1.
2. ['VMware ESX Server 3.5.0 build-110268']: The input data consists of a virtualization software name followed by a version number. The version number in this case is 3.5.
3. ['Linux Linux 2.6 Linux']: The input data consists of the word "Linux" repeated multiple times followed by a version number. The version number in this case is 2.6.
4. ['Red Hat Enterprise AS 4 <2.6-78.0.13.ELlargesmp>']: The input data consists of an operating system name followed by a version number. The version number in this case is 2.6.
5. ['Microsoft <R> Windows <R> 2000 Advanced Server 1.0']: The input data consists of a Windows operating system name followed by a version number. The version number in this case is 1.0.
6. ['Microsoft Windows XP Win2008R2 6.1.7601']: The input data consists of a Windows operating system name followed by a version number. The version number in this case is 6.1.

Summary for Output Column Data:
- The output column consists of version numbers extracted from the input data. The version numbers range from 1.0 to 6.1.

Relationship between Input and Output:
- The output column represents the version numbers extracted from the input data, which are related to the operating systems or software mentioned in the input. The input data provides information about different operating systems and software versions, and the output column specifically focuses on the version numbers mentioned in the input. The relationship between the input and output is that the output column provides a summary of the version numbers extracted from the input data, which helps in understanding the different versions of operating systems and software mentioned in the input., and input as ['AIX 5.1'] output is 5.1, input as ['VMware ESX Server 3.5.0 build-110268'] output is 3.5, input as ['Linux Linux 2.6 Linux'] output is 2.6, input as ['Red Hat Enterprise AS 4 <2.6-78.0.13.ELlargesmp>'] output is 2.6, input as ['Microsoft <R> Windows <R> 2000 Advanced Server 1.0'] output is 1.0, input as ['Microsoft Windows XP Win2008R2 6.1.7601'] output is 6.1, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
