Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: The input data consists of sentences with specific instructions to delete or keep certain words in the text. The output column shows the result of following those instructions. The relationship between the input and output is that the input provides guidance on which words to remove or retain, and the output reflects the text after those actions have been taken. The assistant's role is to accurately carry out the instructions provided in the input data to generate the desired output., and input as ['This is a line. /delete words in the area /keep this part'] output is This is a line. keep this part, input as ['/delete words in the area /'] output is , , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
