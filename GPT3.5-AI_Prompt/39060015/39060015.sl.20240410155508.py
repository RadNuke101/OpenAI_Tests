Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Summary for Input Column Data:
- The input column data consists of sentences with instructions on which words to delete and which words to keep.

Summary for Output Column Data:
- The output column data shows the result of following the instructions provided in the input column, where words specified to be deleted have been removed.

Relationship between Input and Output:
- The input column provides specific instructions on which words to delete and which words to keep, which are then applied to the text in the output column. The relationship between the input and output is that the output is the result of following the instructions given in the input., and input as ['This is a line. /delete words in the area /keep this part'] output is This is a line. keep this part, input as ['/delete words in the area /'] output is , , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.

print(generated_function('This is a line. /delete words in the area /keep this part'))

print(generated_function("This is a line. /delete words in the area /keep this part"))  ## Output: This is a line. keep this part
print(generated_function("/delete words in the area /"))  ## Output:
