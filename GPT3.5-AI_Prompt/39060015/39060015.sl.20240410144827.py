Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Summary for Input Column 1:
The input column contains sentences with instructions to delete certain words or phrases in the text.

Summary for Output Column:
The output column shows the result of following the instructions in the input column, where the specified words or phrases have been deleted from the original text.

Relationship between Input and Output:
The input column provides specific instructions on which words or phrases to delete from the text. The output column demonstrates the result of following these instructions, with the deleted words or phrases removed from the original text. The relationship between the input and output is one of transformation, where the input guides the changes made to the text to produce the final output., and input as ['This is a line. /delete words in the area /keep this part'] output is This is a line. keep this part, input as ['/delete words in the area /'] output is , , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
