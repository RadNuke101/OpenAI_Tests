Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Input Column Summary:
- The input column data consists of company names, with the format 'Name= Company Name'. The company names vary, with examples including ABC Retailers and XYZ Suppliers.

Output Column Summary:
- The output column consists of the company names extracted from the input data, such as ABC Retailers and XYZ Suppliers.

Relationship Summary:
- The relationship between the input and output columns is that the output column directly reflects the company names provided in the input data. The input data contains additional text ('Name=') that is not present in the output, indicating that the output is a clean extraction of the company names. The input data serves as the source of information for the output, with the output column serving as a simplified representation of the input data., and input as ['Name= ABC Retailers'] output is ABC Retailers, input as [' ame= XYZ Suppliers'] output is XYZ Suppliers, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.

    company_name = input_str.split('= ')[1]
    
    return company_name

# Test cases
print(generated_function('Name= ABC Retailers'))  # Output: ABC Retailers
print(generated_function('Name= XYZ Suppliers'))  # Output: XYZ Suppliers
print(generated_function("Name= ABC Retailers"))  ## Output: ABC Retailers
print(generated_function(" ame= XYZ Suppliers"))  ## Output: XYZ Suppliers
