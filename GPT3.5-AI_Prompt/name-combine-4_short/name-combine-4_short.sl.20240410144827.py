Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Summary for Input Column 1 (First Names):
- The first names in the input column are diverse and unique, ranging from Launa to Rudolf.
- There is no apparent pattern or common theme among the first names.

Summary for Input Column 2 (Last Names):
- The last names in the input column are also varied, including Withers, Edison, Hage, Lango, and Akiyama.
- Like the first names, there is no clear pattern or similarity among the last names.

Summary for Output Column (Last Name, First Initial):
- The output column consistently displays the last name followed by the first initial, separated by a comma and a space.
- This format is maintained for all input combinations, creating a uniform and standardized output.

Relationship between Input and Output:
- The output column follows a specific format of last name followed by first initial, regardless of the input first and last names.
- The relationship between the input and output is that the last name is prioritized in the output, with the first initial added for clarity.
- This relationship ensures that the output remains consistent and easy to read, despite the varying input data., and input as ['Launa', 'Withers'] output is Withers, L., input as ['Lakenya', 'Edison'] output is Edison, L., input as ['Brendan', 'Hage'] output is Hage, B., input as ['Bradford', 'Lango'] output is Lango, B., input as ['Rudolf', 'Akiyama'] output is Akiyama, R., , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.

# Define the generated function
def generated_function(first_name, last_name):
    # Combine last name and first initial in the specified format
    output = last_name + ', ' + first_name[0] + '.'
    return output

# Test cases
print(generated_function('Launa', 'Withers'))
print(generated_function('Lakenya', 'Edison'))
print(generated_function('Brendan', 'Hage'))
print(generated_function('Bradford', 'Lango'))
print(generated_function('Rudolf', 'Akiyama'))
print(generated_function("Launa", "Withers"))  ## Output: Withers, L.
print(generated_function("Lakenya", "Edison"))  ## Output: Edison, L.
print(generated_function("Brendan", "Hage"))  ## Output: Hage, B.
print(generated_function("Bradford", "Lango"))  ## Output: Lango, B.
print(generated_function("Rudolf", "Akiyama"))  ## Output: Akiyama, R.
