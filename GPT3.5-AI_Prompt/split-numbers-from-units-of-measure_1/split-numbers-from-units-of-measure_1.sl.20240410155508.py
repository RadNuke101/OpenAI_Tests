Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Summary for Input Column Data:
- The input column data consists of measurements with units such as 'v' for volts, 'hrs' for hours, and 'm' for meters. The values in the input column data range from single digits to three digits.

Summary for Output Column Data:
- The output column data consists of numerical values ranging from single digits to three digits.

Relationship between Input and Output:
- The relationship between the input and output columns is that the numerical value in the input column corresponds to the output value. The units in the input column do not affect the output value, as the output is always the numerical value without the unit. The output value is directly derived from the numerical value in the input column., and input as ['80v', '3'] output is 80, input as ['10hrs', '3'] output is 10, input as ['7h', '2'] output is 7, input as ['500m', '4'] output is 500, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.

# Define the generated function
def generated_function(input_str, output_str):
    # Remove the units from the input string and convert to integer for output
    output = int(''.join(filter(str.isdigit, input_str)))
    return output

# Test cases
generated_function('80v', '80')
generated_function('10hrs', '10')
generated_function('7h', '7')
generated_function('500m', '500')
print(generated_function("80v", "3"))  ## Output: 80
print(generated_function("10hrs", "3"))  ## Output: 10
print(generated_function("7h", "2"))  ## Output: 7
print(generated_function("500m", "4"))  ## Output: 500
