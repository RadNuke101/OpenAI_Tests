Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Summary for input column data:
- The input column data consists of a combination of numbers and units (e.g., '80v', '10hrs', '7h', '500m'). The units vary in format, including 'v' for volts, 'hrs' for hours, 'h' for hours, and 'm' for meters.

Summary for output column data:
- The output column data consists of numbers only (e.g., 80, 10, 7, 500). The numbers represent a quantity related to the input data, but the specific relationship is not immediately clear from the examples provided.

Relationship between input and output:
- Based on the examples provided, it appears that the output is derived from the numerical value in the input data, with the units being disregarded. For example, '80v' corresponds to an output of 80, '10hrs' corresponds to an output of 10, '7h' corresponds to an output of 7, and '500m' corresponds to an output of 500. This suggests that the output is a direct representation of the numerical value in the input data, independent of the units provided., and input as ['80v', '3'] output is 80, input as ['10hrs', '3'] output is 10, input as ['7h', '2'] output is 7, input as ['500m', '4'] output is 500, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.

# Define the generated function
def generated_function(input_str, num):
    # Extract the numerical value from the input string
    num_value = int(''.join(filter(str.isdigit, input_str)))
    return num_value

# Test cases
print(generated_function('80v', 3))  # Output: 80
print(generated_function('10hrs', 3))  # Output: 10
print(generated_function('7h', 2))  # Output: 7
print(generated_function('500m', 4))  # Output: 500
print(generated_function("80v", "3"))  ## Output: 80
print(generated_function("10hrs", "3"))  ## Output: 10
print(generated_function("7h", "2"))  ## Output: 7
print(generated_function("500m", "4"))  ## Output: 500
