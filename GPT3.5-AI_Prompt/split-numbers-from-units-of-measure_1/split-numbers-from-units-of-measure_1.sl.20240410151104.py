Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Summary for Input Column Data:
- The input column data consists of a combination of numbers and units (e.g., '80v', '10hrs', '7h', '500m'). The units vary in format, including 'v' for volts, 'hrs' for hours, 'h' for hours, and 'm' for meters.

Summary for Output Column Data:
- The output column data consists of numerical values extracted from the input column data. The output values represent the magnitude of the input data without the units.

Relationship between Input and Output:
- The relationship between the input and output data involves extracting the numerical value from the input data while disregarding the units. The output values represent the quantitative magnitude of the qualitative input data. This process involves interpreting the input data to determine the relevant numerical information., and input as ['80v', '3'] output is 80, input as ['10hrs', '3'] output is 10, input as ['7h', '2'] output is 7, input as ['500m', '4'] output is 500, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.

# Define the generated function

    # Extract the numerical value from the input data
    output = int(''.join(filter(str.isdigit, input_str)))
    
    return output

# Test cases

print(generated_function('7h', 2))  # Output: 7
print(generated_function('500m', 4))  # Output: 500
print(generated_function("80v", "3"))  ## Output: 80
print(generated_function("10hrs", "3"))  ## Output: 10
print(generated_function("7h", "2"))  ## Output: 7
print(generated_function("500m", "4"))  ## Output: 500
