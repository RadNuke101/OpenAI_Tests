Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Summary for Input Column Data:
- The input column data consists of a combination of numerical values followed by qualitative units such as 'v' for volts, 'hrs' for hours, and 'm' for meters.

Summary for Output Column Data:
- The output column data consists of numerical values representing a quantity or measurement.

Relationship between Input and Output:
- The input column data provides information about the unit of measurement for the numerical value, while the output column data represents the actual quantity or measurement. The relationship between the input and output is that the numerical value in the input column corresponds to the quantity or measurement in the output column. The input column helps to interpret and understand the numerical value in the output column by providing context in terms of units of measurement., and input as ['80v', '3'] output is 80, input as ['10hrs', '3'] output is 10, input as ['7h', '2'] output is 7, input as ['500m', '4'] output is 500, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.

# Define the generated function
def generated_function(input_str):
    # Split the input string into numerical value and unit
    num, unit = input_str[:-1], input_str[-1]
    
    # Convert numerical value to integer
    num = int(num)
    
    # Return the numerical value
    return num

# Test cases
print(generated_function('80v')) # Output: 80
print(generated_function('10hrs')) # Output: 10
print(generated_function('7h')) # Output: 7
print(generated_function('500m')) # Output: 500
print(generated_function("80v", "3"))  ## Output: 80
print(generated_function("10hrs", "3"))  ## Output: 10
print(generated_function("7h", "2"))  ## Output: 7
print(generated_function("500m", "4"))  ## Output: 500
