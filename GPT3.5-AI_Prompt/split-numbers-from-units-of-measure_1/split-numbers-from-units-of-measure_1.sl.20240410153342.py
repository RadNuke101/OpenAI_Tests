Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Summary for Input Column Data:
- The input column data consists of measurements with a unit attached to them, such as '80v', '10hrs', '7h', '500m'. The units vary between volts (v), hours (hrs), hours (h), and meters (m).

Summary for Output Column Data:
- The output column data consists of numerical values without units, such as 80, 10, 7, 500.

Relationship between Input and Output:
- The relationship between the input and output data appears to involve extracting the numerical value from the input measurement while disregarding the unit. This suggests that the output is derived solely from the numerical part of the input data, regardless of the unit attached to it., and input as ['80v', '3'] output is 80, input as ['10hrs', '3'] output is 10, input as ['7h', '2'] output is 7, input as ['500m', '4'] output is 500, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.

# Define the generated function
def generated_function(input_str, output_str):
    # Extract the numerical value from the input string
    numerical_value = int(''.join(filter(str.isdigit, input_str)))
    return numerical_value

# Test cases
print(generated_function('80v', '80'))
print(generated_function('10hrs', '10'))
print(generated_function('7h', '7'))
print(generated_function('500m', '500'))
print(generated_function("80v", "3"))  ## Output: 80
print(generated_function("10hrs", "3"))  ## Output: 10
print(generated_function("7h", "2"))  ## Output: 7
print(generated_function("500m", "4"))  ## Output: 500
