Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Input Summary:
The input data consists of phrases or statements that are focused on different aspects such as time, evil, and life. Each input represents a different concept or idea.

Output Summary:
The output column consists of words that are related to negative or undesirable concepts, such as evil. The output seems to be a reflection of the negative or challenging aspects of the input data.

Relationship Summary:
The relationship between the input and output columns appears to be centered around the idea of focusing on negative or challenging aspects of life. The input data may be prompting reflection on these aspects, while the output column highlights the negative or undesirable elements present in the input. This suggests a theme of introspection and contemplation of difficult truths., and input as ['focus on one thing at a time'] output is time, input as ['premature opt is the root of all evil'] output is evil, input as ['where is life'] output is life, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
