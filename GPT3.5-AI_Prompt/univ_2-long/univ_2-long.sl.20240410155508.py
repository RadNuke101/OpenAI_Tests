Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: The input data consists of various university names along with their locations. The output data includes the university name, location, and the country (USA) for each entry. 

From the input data, we can see that each university is associated with a specific location, which includes the city and state. The output data appends "USA" to each location, indicating that all universities are located in the United States.

Therefore, the relationship between the input and output data is that the input provides the university name and location details, while the output includes the same information with the addition of the country name (USA). This allows for a clear identification of the country where each university is located., and input as ['University of Pennsylvania', 'Phialdelphia, PA, USA'] output is University of Pennsylvania, Phialdelphia, PA, USA, input as ['UCLA', 'Los Angeles, CA'] output is UCLA, Los Angeles, CA, USA, input as ['Cornell University', 'Ithaca, New York, USA'] output is Cornell University, Ithaca, New York, USA, input as ['Penn', 'Philadelphia, PA, USA'] output is Penn, Philadelphia, PA, USA, input as ['University of Maryland College Park', 'College Park, MD'] output is University of Maryland College Park, College Park, MD, USA, input as ['University of Michigan', 'Ann Arbor, MI, USA'] output is University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA, input as ['UC Berkeley', 'Berkeley, CA'] output is UC Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA, input as ['MIT', 'Cambridge, MA'] output is MIT, Cambridge, MA, USA, input as ['Rice University', 'Houston, TX'] output is Rice University, Houston, TX, USA, input as ['Yale University', 'New Haven, CT, USA'] output is Yale University, New Haven, CT, USA, input as ['Columbia University', 'New York, NY, USA'] output is Columbia University, New York, NY, USA, input as ['NYU', 'New York, New York, USA'] output is NYU, New York, New York, USA, input as ['UC Berkeley', 'Berkeley, CA'] output is UC Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA, input as ['UIUC', 'Urbana, IL'] output is UIUC, Urbana, IL, USA, input as ['Temple University', 'Philadelphia, PA'] output is Temple University, Philadelphia, PA, USA, input as ['Harvard University', 'Cambridge, MA, USA'] output is Harvard University, Cambridge, MA, USA, input as ['University of Connecticut', 'Storrs, CT, USA'] output is University of Connecticut, Storrs, CT, USA, input as ['Drexel University', 'Philadelphia, PA'] output is Drexel University, Philadelphia, PA, USA, input as ['New Haven University', 'New Haven, CT, USA'] output is New Haven University, New Haven, CT, USA, input as ['University of California, Santa Barbara', 'Santa Barbara, CA, USA'] output is University of California, Santa Barbara, Santa Barbara, CA, USA, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
