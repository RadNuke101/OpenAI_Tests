Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Summary for Input Column Data:
- The input column data consists of dates, times, phone numbers, and text (loren ipsum or loren).
- The text in the input column data seems to be random and unrelated to the other elements such as dates, times, and phone numbers.

Summary for Output Column Data:
- The output column data consists of the text "loren ipsum" or "loren".
- The output column data seems to be a mix of the text "loren" and "ipsum", with "loren" being the most common.

Relationship between Input and Output:
- The input column data does not seem to have a direct relationship with the output column data.
- The output column data appears to be a subset of the text found in the input column data, specifically containing variations of the word "loren".
- The input column data may contain additional information or context that is not reflected in the output column data.
- The output column data seems to be a result of filtering or extracting specific text elements from the input column data., and input as ['Dec 2, 2014, 11=23 PM - +91 90000 80000= loren ipsum'] output is loren ipsum, input as ['Dec 2, 2014, 11=24 PM - +91 90000 80000= loren'] output is loren, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.

# Define the generated function
def generated_function(input_str):
    # Split the input string into date, time, phone number, and text
    input_list = input_str.split(' - ')
    text = input_list[1].split('= ')[1]
    
    # Return the extracted text
    return text

# Test cases
print(generated_function('Dec 2, 2014, 11=23 PM - +91 90000 80000= loren ipsum'))
print(generated_function('Dec 2, 2014, 11=24 PM - +91 90000 80000= loren'))
print(generated_function("Dec 2, 2014, 11=23 PM - +91 90000 80000= loren ipsum"))  ## Output: loren ipsum
print(generated_function("Dec 2, 2014, 11=24 PM - +91 90000 80000= loren"))  ## Output: loren
