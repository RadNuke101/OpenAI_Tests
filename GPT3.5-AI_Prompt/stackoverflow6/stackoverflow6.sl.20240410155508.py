Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Summary for Input Column Data:
- The input column data consists of dates, times, phone numbers, and text (loren ipsum or loren).
- The text in the input column data seems to be randomly placed within the string.

Summary for Output Column Data:
- The output column data consists of the text "loren ipsum" or "loren".
- The text in the output column data is the last part of the input string.

Relationship between Input and Output:
- The output column data seems to be extracted from the input column data by taking the last part of the string after the "=" sign.
- The input column data provides additional context such as dates, times, and phone numbers, with the output being the text that follows the "=" sign.
- The input column data serves as a source of information, with the output column data being a specific piece of text extracted from it., and input as ['Dec 2, 2014, 11=23 PM - +91 90000 80000= loren ipsum'] output is loren ipsum, input as ['Dec 2, 2014, 11=24 PM - +91 90000 80000= loren'] output is loren, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
