Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Summary for Input Column Data:
- The input column data consists of dates, times, phone numbers, and text (loren ipsum or loren).
- The dates are in the format "Month Day, Year" (e.g., Dec 2, 2014).
- The times are in the format "Hour:Minute AM/PM" (e.g., 11:23 PM).
- The phone numbers are in the format "+91 90000 80000".
- The text is either "loren ipsum" or "loren".

Summary for Output Column Data:
- The output column data consists of the text "loren ipsum" or "loren".

Relationship between Input and Output:
- The input data seems to contain a pattern where the text "loren ipsum" is associated with a specific date, time, and phone number combination.
- The output data is either "loren ipsum" or "loren", with the former being more common in the input data.
- It appears that the presence of specific date, time, and phone number combinations in the input data leads to the output being "loren ipsum".
- The input data may be structured in a way that links the text "loren ipsum" to certain contextual information provided in the input columns., and input as ['Dec 2, 2014, 11=23 PM - +91 90000 80000= loren ipsum'] output is loren ipsum, input as ['Dec 2, 2014, 11=24 PM - +91 90000 80000= loren'] output is loren, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.

# Define the generated function
def generated_function(input_str):
    # Split the input string into date, time, phone number, and text
    date, time, phone, text = input_str.split(', ')
    
    # Check if the text is "loren ipsum" and return the appropriate output
    if text == "loren ipsum":
        return "loren ipsum"
    else:
        return "loren"

# Test cases
print(generated_function("Dec 2, 2014, 11:23 PM - +91 90000 80000, loren ipsum"))  # Output: loren ipsum
print(generated_function("Dec 2, 2014, 11:24 PM - +91 90000 80000, loren"))  # Output: loren
print(generated_function("Dec 2, 2014, 11=23 PM - +91 90000 80000= loren ipsum"))  ## Output: loren ipsum
print(generated_function("Dec 2, 2014, 11=24 PM - +91 90000 80000= loren"))  ## Output: loren
