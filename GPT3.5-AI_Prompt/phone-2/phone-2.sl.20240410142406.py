Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: For the input column data, each entry consists of a phone number in the format of '###-###-###'. The first part of the phone number seems to be random and does not follow a specific pattern. The last part of the phone number represents the output value.

As for the output column, it appears to be the last three digits of each phone number in the input column. This suggests that the output is derived from the last part of the phone number.

Therefore, the relationship between the input and the output is that the output is extracted from the last three digits of each phone number in the input column., and input as ['938-242-504'] output is 504, input as ['308-916-545'] output is 545, input as ['623-599-749'] output is 749, input as ['981-424-843'] output is 843, input as ['118-980-214'] output is 214, input as ['244-655-094'] output is 094, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.

# Define the generated function
