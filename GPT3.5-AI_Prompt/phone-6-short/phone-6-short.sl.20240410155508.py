Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Summary for Input Column Data:
The input column data consists of phone numbers with country codes. Each entry starts with a country code followed by a series of numbers separated by hyphens. The country codes vary in length, and the numbers following the country code also vary in length. The format is consistent across all entries.

Summary for Output Column Data:
The output column data consists of the middle set of numbers in each phone number entry. These numbers are consistent in format and length across all entries.

Relationship between Input and Output:
The output column data represents the middle set of numbers in each phone number entry. The input column data provides the complete phone number, with the output being a specific part of that number. The relationship between the input and output is that the output is a subset of the input, specifically the middle set of numbers. The input column data provides context for the output, showing where the output numbers fit within the complete phone number., and input as ['+106 769-858-438'] output is 769, input as ['+83 973-757-831'] output is 973, input as ['+62 647-787-775'] output is 647, input as ['+172 027-507-632'] output is 027, input as ['+72 001-050-856'] output is 001, input as ['+95 310-537-401'] output is 310, input as ['+6 775-969-238'] output is 775, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
