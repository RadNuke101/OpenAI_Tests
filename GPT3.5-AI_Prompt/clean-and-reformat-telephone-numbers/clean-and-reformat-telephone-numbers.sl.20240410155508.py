Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Summary for Input Column Data:
- The input column data consists of phone numbers in various formats such as '801-456-8765', '<978> 654-0299', and '978.654.0299'.

Summary for Output Column Data:
- The output column data consists of phone numbers that have been standardized to a consistent format without any special characters, resulting in numbers like 8014568765 and 9786540299.

Relationship between Input and Output:
- The relationship between the input and output is that the input column data contains phone numbers in different formats, while the output column data standardizes these numbers by removing any special characters and providing a consistent format for all phone numbers. This standardization process ensures that the output column data is clean and uniform, making it easier to work with and analyze., and input as ['801-456-8765'] output is 8014568765, input as ['<978> 654-0299'] output is 9786540299, input as ['978.654.0299'] output is 9786540299, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
