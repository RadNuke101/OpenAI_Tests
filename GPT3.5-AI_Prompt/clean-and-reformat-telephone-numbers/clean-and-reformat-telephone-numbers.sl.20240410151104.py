Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Summary for Input Column Data:
- The input column data consists of phone numbers in various formats, including with dashes, parentheses, and periods.

Summary for Output Column Data:
- The output column data consists of phone numbers without any special characters, only numerical digits.

Relationship between Input and Output:
- The relationship between the input and output is that the input column data contains phone numbers in different formats, while the output column data standardizes these numbers by removing any special characters and converting them to numerical digits. This process ensures consistency and uniformity in the phone number data., and input as ['801-456-8765'] output is 8014568765, input as ['<978> 654-0299'] output is 9786540299, input as ['978.654.0299'] output is 9786540299, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.

# Test cases

print(generated_function('978.654.0299'))  # Output: 9786540299
print(generated_function("801-456-8765"))  ## Output: 8014568765
print(generated_function("<978> 654-0299"))  ## Output: 9786540299
