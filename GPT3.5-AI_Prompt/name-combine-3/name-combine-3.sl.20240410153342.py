Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Summary for Input Column 1 (First Names):
- The first names in the input column are varied and unique, ranging from Launa to Rudolf to Lara.
- There is no specific pattern or trend in the first names provided.

Summary for Input Column 2 (Last Names):
- The last names in the input column are also diverse, including Withers, Edison, Hage, Lango, Akiyama, and Constable.
- Like the first names, there is no apparent connection or similarity between the last names.

Summary for Output Column (Formatted Names):
- The output column consists of formatted names with the first initial capitalized followed by a period and the last name.
- The formatting is consistent across all entries in the output column.

Relationship between Input and Output:
- The output column seems to be derived from the input columns by taking the first initial of the first name and combining it with the last name.
- There is a clear and consistent relationship between the input data and the output format, where the first initial of the first name is used to create the formatted name.
- The output column provides a standardized and uniform representation of the input data, making it easier to identify individuals based on their first and last names., and input as ['Launa', 'Withers'] output is L. Withers, input as ['Lakenya', 'Edison'] output is L. Edison, input as ['Brendan', 'Hage'] output is B. Hage, input as ['Bradford', 'Lango'] output is B. Lango, input as ['Rudolf', 'Akiyama'] output is R. Akiyama, input as ['Lara', 'Constable'] output is L. Constable, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
