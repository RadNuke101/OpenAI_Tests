Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Input Column 1 Summary:
The first names in the input column seem to vary in length and uniqueness, with a mix of common and less common names.

Input Column 2 Summary:
The last names in the input column also vary in length and uniqueness, with a mix of common and less common surnames.

Output Column Summary:
The output column consistently displays the initial of the first name followed by a period and then the last name. This format creates a formal and professional appearance for the names.

Relationship between Input and Output:
The relationship between the input and output columns is that the output column takes the first initial of the first name and combines it with the last name, separated by a period. This creates a standardized and formal way of presenting the names, emphasizing the first initial while still including the full last name. The output column maintains consistency in its formatting, regardless of the variations in the input column data., and input as ['Launa', 'Withers'] output is L. Withers, input as ['Lakenya', 'Edison'] output is L. Edison, input as ['Brendan', 'Hage'] output is B. Hage, input as ['Bradford', 'Lango'] output is B. Lango, input as ['Rudolf', 'Akiyama'] output is R. Akiyama, input as ['Lara', 'Constable'] output is L. Constable, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
