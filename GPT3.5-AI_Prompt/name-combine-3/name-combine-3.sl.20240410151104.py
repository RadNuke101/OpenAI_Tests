Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Summary for Input Column 1 (First Names):
- The first names in the input column are diverse and unique, ranging from Launa to Rudolf to Lara.
- There is no clear pattern or common theme among the first names.

Summary for Input Column 2 (Last Names):
- The last names in the input column are also varied, including Withers, Edison, Hage, Lango, Akiyama, and Constable.
- Like the first names, there is no apparent connection or similarity between the last names.

Summary for Output Column (Formatted Names):
- The output column consistently follows the format of initial of the first name followed by the full last name, separated by a period and space.
- This format creates a sense of formality and professionalism in the output names.

Relationship between Input and Output:
- The output format consistently uses the initial of the first name and the full last name, regardless of the specific first and last names in the input.
- This relationship suggests a standardized and structured approach to presenting names, emphasizing clarity and simplicity in the output format.
- The output format maintains a level of professionalism and uniformity across all input combinations, ensuring a cohesive and organized presentation of names., and input as ['Launa', 'Withers'] output is L. Withers, input as ['Lakenya', 'Edison'] output is L. Edison, input as ['Brendan', 'Hage'] output is B. Hage, input as ['Bradford', 'Lango'] output is B. Lango, input as ['Rudolf', 'Akiyama'] output is R. Akiyama, input as ['Lara', 'Constable'] output is L. Constable, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
