Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Summary for Input Column 1:
The first names in the input column seem to vary in length and uniqueness. They range from traditional names like "Bradford" and "Rudolf" to more modern names like "Launa" and "Lakenya".

Summary for Input Column 2:
The last names in the input column also vary in length and style. Some are more common like "Withers" and "Edison", while others are less common like "Hage" and "Lango".

Summary for Output Column:
The output column consistently starts with the first initial of the first name in the input column, followed by a period and then the last name. This creates a formal and professional format for presenting the names.

Relationship between Input and Output:
The relationship between the input and output columns is that the output column takes the first initial of the first name in the input column and combines it with the last name to create a formal and structured presentation of the names. This relationship ensures consistency and professionalism in the output., and input as ['Launa', 'Withers'] output is L. Withers, input as ['Lakenya', 'Edison'] output is L. Edison, input as ['Brendan', 'Hage'] output is B. Hage, input as ['Bradford', 'Lango'] output is B. Lango, input as ['Rudolf', 'Akiyama'] output is R. Akiyama, input as ['Lara', 'Constable'] output is L. Constable, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
