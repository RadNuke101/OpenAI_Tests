Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Summary for Input Column Data:
1. ['red ball, green sweater', 'red', 'green', 'pink']: The input column data includes colors such as red, green, and pink found in the given text strings.
2. ['pink ball, green sweater', 'red', 'green', 'pink']: The input column data includes colors such as red, green, and pink found in the given text strings.
3. ['blue sea, pink ribbon', 'red', 'blue', 'pink']: The input column data includes colors such as red, blue, and pink found in the given text strings.
4. ['black sea, white ribbon', 'red', 'blue', 'pink']: The input column data includes colors such as red, blue, and pink found in the given text strings.
5. ['red green blue', 'red', 'blue', 'pink']: The input column data includes colors such as red, blue, and pink found in the given text strings.

Summary for Output Column:
- The output column indicates whether the given input text strings contain the colors 'red', 'green', and 'pink' simultaneously. If all three colors are present in the input text, the output is true; otherwise, it is false.

Relationship between Input and Output:
- The output column is determined based on the presence of specific colors ('red', 'green', 'pink') in the input text strings. If all three colors are mentioned in the input, the output is true; otherwise, it is false. The relationship between the input and output is based on the presence or absence of these specific colors in the text strings., and input as ['red ball, green sweater', 'red', 'green', 'pink'] output is true, input as ['pink ball, green sweater', 'red', 'green', 'pink'] output is false, input as ['blue sea, pink ribbon', 'red', 'blue', 'pink'] output is false, input as ['black sea, white ribbon', 'red', 'blue', 'pink'] output is false, input as ['red green blue', 'red', 'blue', 'pink'] output is true, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
