Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Summary for Input Column Data:
The input column data consists of phone numbers with country codes. Each entry starts with a country code followed by the phone number. The country codes range from 6 to 172.

Summary for Output Column:
The output column consists of the extracted country codes from the input phone numbers. The extracted country codes range from 6 to 172.

Relationship between Input and Output:
The output column represents the country codes extracted from the input phone numbers. The relationship between the input and output is that the output directly corresponds to the country code present at the beginning of each input phone number. The output column serves as a way to categorize and identify the country of origin for each phone number provided in the input column., and input as ['+106 769-858-438'] output is 106, input as ['+83 973-757-831'] output is 83, input as ['+62 647-787-775'] output is 62, input as ['+172 027-507-632'] output is 172, input as ['+72 001-050-856'] output is 72, input as ['+95 310-537-401'] output is 95, input as ['+6 775-969-238'] output is 6, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
