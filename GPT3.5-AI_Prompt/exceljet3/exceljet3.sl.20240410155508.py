Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Summary for input column 'year':
- The data in the 'year' column consists of the year of a vehicle, such as 2016.

Summary for input column 'make':
- The data in the 'make' column consists of the make or brand of a vehicle, such as Subaru.

Summary for input column 'model':
- The data in the 'model' column consists of the model of a vehicle, such as Outback Wagon.

Summary for input column 'fuel economy':
- The data in the 'fuel economy' column consists of the fuel economy of a vehicle, such as 25/33.

Summary for output column:
- The output column contains the corresponding values for each input column, such as 2016, Subaru, Outback Wagon, and 25/33.

Relationship between input and output:
- The input columns 'year', 'make', 'model', and 'fuel economy' provide specific details about a vehicle, while the output column combines these details to represent a complete description of a specific vehicle. The input columns serve as individual pieces of information that collectively contribute to the overall description of the vehicle in the output column., and input as ['year= 2016'] output is 2016, input as ['make= subaru'] output is subaru, input as ['model= outback wagon'] output is outback wagon, input as ['fuel economy= 25/33'] output is 25/33, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.

def generated_function(year, make, model, fuel_economy):
    # Combine the input values to form the output
    output = f"{year}, {make}, {model}, {fuel_economy}"
    return output

# Test cases
print(generated_function('2016', 'Subaru', 'Outback Wagon', '25/33'))
print(generated_function("year= 2016"))  ## Output: 2016
print(generated_function("make= subaru"))  ## Output: subaru
print(generated_function("model= outback wagon"))  ## Output: outback wagon
print(generated_function("fuel economy= 25/33"))  ## Output: 25/33
