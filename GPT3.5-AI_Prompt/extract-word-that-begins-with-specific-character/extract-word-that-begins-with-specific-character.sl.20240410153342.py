Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Summary for Input Column Data:
- The input column data consists of phrases containing placeholders like _username, _name1, _name2.
- The placeholders are used in different contexts within the phrases.

Summary for Output Column:
- The output column consists of the placeholders used in the input phrases.

Relationship between Input and Output:
- The input phrases contain placeholders that are replaced by specific values in the output.
- The output column serves as a reference to the placeholders used in the input phrases.
- The relationship between input and output is that the placeholders in the input are identified and listed in the output., and input as ['this is a _username in the middle'] output is _username, input as ['twitter names look like= _name'] output is _name, input as ['with two _name1 and _name2'] output is _name1, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.

# Define the generated function
def generated_function(input_str):
    # Split the input string to extract the placeholder
    placeholder = input_str.split()[3]
    
    return placeholder

# Test cases
print(generated_function('this is a _username in the middle'))  # Output: _username
print(generated_function('twitter names look like= _name'))  # Output: _name
print(generated_function('with two _name1 and _name2'))  # Output: _name1
print(generated_function("this is a _username in the middle"))  ## Output: _username
print(generated_function("twitter names look like= _name"))  ## Output: _name
print(generated_function("with two _name1 and _name2"))  ## Output: _name1
