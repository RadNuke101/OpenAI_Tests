Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Summary for Input Column Data:
- The input column data consists of qualitative information in the form of words ('one', 'two', 'three', 'four') and corresponding numbers ('1', '2', '3', '4').
- Each word in the input column data represents a quantity or count of a specific item.

Summary for Output Column Data:
- The output column data consists of different types of fruits ('apple', 'banana', 'strawberry', 'orange') corresponding to the input data.
- The output column data indicates a relationship between the input quantity and the type of fruit provided as output.

Relationship between Input and Output:
- The input data ('one', 'two', 'three', 'four') determines the type of fruit output ('apple', 'banana', 'strawberry', 'orange').
- Each input quantity corresponds to a specific type of fruit, suggesting a one-to-one relationship between the input and output columns.
- The output column data is directly influenced by the input column data, with each input value resulting in a specific fruit as output., and input as ['one, 1'] output is one apple, input as ['two, 2'] output is two bananas, input as ['three, 3'] output is three strawberries, input as ['four, 4'] output is four oranges, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.

# Define the generated function
def generated_function(input_str):
    # Create a dictionary mapping input quantities to corresponding fruits
    mapping = {
        'one': 'apple',
        'two': 'banana',
        'three': 'strawberry',
        'four': 'orange'
    }
    
    # Split the input string into quantity and number
    input_quantity, input_number = input_str.split(', ')
    
    # Return the corresponding fruit based on the input quantity
    return mapping[input_quantity]

# Test cases
print(generated_function('one, 1'))  # Output: apple
print(generated_function('two, 2'))  # Output: banana
print(generated_function('three, 3'))  # Output: strawberry
print(generated_function('four, 4'))  # Output: orange
print(generated_function("one, 1"))  ## Output: one apple
print(generated_function("two, 2"))  ## Output: two bananas
print(generated_function("three, 3"))  ## Output: three strawberries
print(generated_function("four, 4"))  ## Output: four oranges
