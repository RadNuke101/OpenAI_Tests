Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Summary for Input Column Data:
- The input column data consists of qualitative information representing different quantities: 'one', 'two', 'three', 'four'.
- Each input value is associated with a numerical value: 1, 2, 3, 4 respectively.
- The input values represent different quantities in a sequential manner.

Summary for Output Column Data:
- The output column data consists of different types of fruits: apple, banana, strawberry, orange.
- Each fruit corresponds to a specific numerical quantity in the input column data.
- The output column data represents the result or outcome based on the input quantity.

Relationship between Input and Output:
- The relationship between the input and output is that each input quantity corresponds to a specific type of fruit in the output.
- The input quantity determines the type of fruit that is associated with it in the output.
- The output is directly influenced by the input, with each input value leading to a specific fruit as the output., and input as ['one, 1'] output is one apple, input as ['two, 2'] output is two bananas, input as ['three, 3'] output is three strawberries, input as ['four, 4'] output is four oranges, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.

# Define the generated function

    # Create a dictionary mapping input quantities to fruits
    input_to_fruit = {'one': 'apple', 'two': 'banana', 'three': 'strawberry', 'four': 'orange'}
    
    # Split the input string into quantity and numerical value
    input_list = input_str.split(', ')
    quantity = input_list[0]
    
    # Return the corresponding fruit based on the input quantity
    return f"{input_list[0]} {input_list[1]} is {input_to_fruit[quantity]}"

# Test cases
print(generated_function('one, 1'))  # Output: one 1 is apple
print(generated_function('two, 2'))  # Output: two 2 is banana
print(generated_function('three, 3'))  # Output: three 3 is strawberry
print(generated_function('four, 4'))  # Output: four 4 is orange
print(generated_function("one, 1"))  ## Output: one apple
print(generated_function("two, 2"))  ## Output: two bananas
print(generated_function("three, 3"))  ## Output: three strawberries
print(generated_function("four, 4"))  ## Output: four oranges
