Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Summary for Input Column Data:
- The input column data consists of strings with a combination of letters and numbers.
- Each input value is a string with a specific pattern, such as starting with 'zx' followed by a series of characters.

Summary for Output Column Data:
- The output column data consists of strings similar to the input values but with one character removed.
- The character removed from the input value is the one specified in the second element of the input list.

Relationship between Input and Output:
- The relationship between the input and output is that the output is derived from the input by removing a specific character specified in the second element of the input list.
- The output is always a modified version of the input, with one character removed based on the specified character in the input list., and input as ['zx66448', 'z'] output is x66448, input as ['zx66448', 'x'] output is z66448, input as ['zx66448', '6'] output is zx448, input as ['zx66448', '4'] output is zx668, input as ['zx66448', '8'] output is zx6644, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
