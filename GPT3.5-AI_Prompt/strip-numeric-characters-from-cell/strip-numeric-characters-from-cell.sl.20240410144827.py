Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Summary for Input Column Data:
- Column 1: The input data consists of phrases or sentences with varying content, such as names, numbers, and objects.

Summary for Output Column Data:
- The output data consists of phrases or sentences that are typically a subset of the input data, with certain elements removed or retained.

Relationship between Input and Output:
- The output column seems to retain only the last word or phrase from the input column, while discarding the rest of the content. This suggests a pattern where the output focuses on the final element mentioned in the input., and input as ['34653 jim mcdonald'] output is  jim mcdonald, input as ['price is 500'] output is  price is , input as ['100 apples'] output is  apples, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.

def generated_function(input_str):
    # Split the input string into words
    words = input_str.split()
    # Return the last word in the input string
    return words[-1]
  
# Test cases
print(generated_function('34653 jim mcdonald'))  # Output: mcdonald
print(generated_function('price is 500'))  # Output: 500
print(generated_function('100 apples'))  # Output: apples
print(generated_function("34653 jim mcdonald"))  ## Output:  jim mcdonald
print(generated_function("price is 500"))  ## Output:  price is 
print(generated_function("100 apples"))  ## Output:  apples
