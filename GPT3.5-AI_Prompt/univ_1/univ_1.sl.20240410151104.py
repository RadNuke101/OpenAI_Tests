Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Summary for Input Column 1 (Qualitative Data):
The input column 1 consists of various university names such as University of Pennsylvania, UCLA, Cornell University, Penn, University of Maryland College Park, University of Michigan, UC Berkeley, MIT, Rice University, Yale University, Columbia University, NYU, UIUC, Temple University, Harvard University, University of Connecticut, Drexel University, New Haven University, and University of California, Santa Barbara.

Summary for Input Column 2 (Qualitative Data):
The input column 2 consists of locations associated with the universities mentioned in column 1, such as Philadelphia, PA, USA, Los Angeles, CA, Ithaca, New York, USA, College Park, MD, Ann Arbor, MI, USA, Berkeley, CA, Cambridge, MA, Houston, TX, New Haven, CT, USA, New York, NY, USA, Urbana, IL, Storrs, CT, USA, and Santa Barbara, CA, USA.

Summary for Output Column (Qualitative Data):
The output column consists of the combination of university names and their respective locations, such as University of Pennsylvania, Phialdelphia, PA, USA, UCLA, Los Angeles, CA, Cornell University, Ithaca, New York, USA, Penn, Philadelphia, PA, USA, University of Maryland College Park, College Park, MD, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA, UC Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, MIT, Cambridge, MA, Rice University, Houston, TX, Yale University, New Haven, CT, USA, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA, NYU, New York, New York, USA, UIUC, Urbana, IL, Temple University, Philadelphia, PA, Harvard University, Cambridge, MA, USA, University of Connecticut, Storrs, CT, USA, Drexel University, Philadelphia, PA, New Haven University, New Haven, CT, USA, University of California, Santa Barbara, Santa Barbara, CA, USA.

Relationship between Input and Output:
The output column is a combination of the university names and their respective locations provided in the input columns. Each university name is paired with its corresponding location to form the output. The input columns provide the university names and locations separately, while the output column combines them to create a complete description of each university's location., and input as ['University of Pennsylvania', 'Phialdelphia, PA, USA'] output is University of Pennsylvania, Phialdelphia, PA, USA, input as ['UCLA', 'Los Angeles, CA'] output is UCLA, Los Angeles, CA, input as ['Cornell University', 'Ithaca, New York, USA'] output is Cornell University, Ithaca, New York, USA, input as ['Penn', 'Philadelphia, PA, USA'] output is Penn, Philadelphia, PA, USA, input as ['University of Maryland College Park', 'College Park, MD'] output is University of Maryland College Park, College Park, MD, input as ['University of Michigan', 'Ann Arbor, MI, USA'] output is University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA, input as ['UC Berkeley', 'Berkeley, CA'] output is UC Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, input as ['MIT', 'Cambridge, MA'] output is MIT, Cambridge, MA, input as ['Rice University', 'Houston, TX'] output is Rice University, Houston, TX, input as ['Yale University', 'New Haven, CT, USA'] output is Yale University, New Haven, CT, USA, input as ['Columbia University', 'New York, NY, USA'] output is Columbia University, New York, NY, USA, input as ['NYU', 'New York, New York, USA'] output is NYU, New York, New York, USA, input as ['UC Berkeley', 'Berkeley, CA'] output is UC Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, input as ['UIUC', 'Urbana, IL'] output is UIUC, Urbana, IL, input as ['Temple University', 'Philadelphia, PA'] output is Temple University, Philadelphia, PA, input as ['Harvard University', 'Cambridge, MA, USA'] output is Harvard University, Cambridge, MA, USA, input as ['University of Connecticut', 'Storrs, CT, USA'] output is University of Connecticut, Storrs, CT, USA, input as ['Drexel University', 'Philadelphia, PA'] output is Drexel University, Philadelphia, PA, input as ['New Haven University', 'New Haven, CT, USA'] output is New Haven University, New Haven, CT, USA, input as ['University of California, Santa Barbara', 'Santa Barbara, CA, USA'] output is University of California, Santa Barbara, Santa Barbara, CA, USA, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
