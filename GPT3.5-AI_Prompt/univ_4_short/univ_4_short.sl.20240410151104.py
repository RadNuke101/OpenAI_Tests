Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Summary for Input Column Data:
The input column data consists of various universities or educational institutions along with their locations. The locations include city names, states, and sometimes countries.

Summary for Output Column Data:
The output column data consists of the locations corresponding to the input universities or educational institutions. It includes city names, states, and countries.

Relationship between Input and Output:
The input column data provides information about different universities and their locations, while the output column data specifically lists the locations corresponding to each university. The relationship between the input and output is that the output provides a concise representation of the location information provided in the input. The output serves as a summary or extraction of the location details for each university mentioned in the input., and input as ['University of Pennsylvania', 'Phialdelphia, PA, USA'] output is Phialdelphia, PA, USA, input as ['UCLA', 'Los Angeles, CA'] output is Los Angeles, CA, USA, input as ['Cornell University', 'Ithaca, New York, USA'] output is Ithaca, NY, USA, input as ['Penn', 'Philadelphia, PA, USA'] output is Philadelphia, PA, USA, input as ['University of Maryland College Park', 'College Park, MD'] output is College Park, MD, USA, input as ['University of Michigan', 'Ann Arbor, MI, USA'] output is Ann Arbor, MI, USA, input as ['Columbia University', 'New York, NY, USA'] output is New York, NY, USA, input as ['NYU', 'New York, New York, USA'] output is New York, NY, USA, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.

    # Split the input string into university and location
    university, location = input_str.split(', ')
    
    # Return the location as the output
    return location
