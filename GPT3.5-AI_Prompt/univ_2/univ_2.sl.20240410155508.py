Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Input Column Data Summary:
- The input column data consists of the names of various universities or educational institutions along with their locations.
- Each entry in the input column data includes the name of the institution followed by the city, state, and country where it is located.
- The entries vary in length and format, with some including additional information such as the full name of the state or country.

Output Column Data Summary:
- The output column data consists of the names of universities or educational institutions along with their locations, formatted in a consistent manner.
- Each entry in the output column data includes the name of the institution followed by the city and state where it is located, with the addition of "USA" at the end.
- The output column data is a combination of the input data with the standardized addition of "USA" at the end of each location.

Relationship between Input and Output:
- The relationship between the input and output columns is that the output column data is a standardized version of the input data with the addition of "USA" at the end of each location.
- The input column data provides the names of universities and their locations in various formats, while the output column data presents the same information in a consistent format with the inclusion of "USA" to indicate the country.
- The output column data serves as a standardized representation of the input data, making it easier to compare and analyze the locations of different universities., and input as ['University of Pennsylvania', 'Phialdelphia, PA, USA'] output is University of Pennsylvania, Phialdelphia, PA, USA, input as ['UCLA', 'Los Angeles, CA'] output is UCLA, Los Angeles, CA, USA, input as ['Cornell University', 'Ithaca, New York, USA'] output is Cornell University, Ithaca, New York, USA, input as ['Penn', 'Philadelphia, PA, USA'] output is Penn, Philadelphia, PA, USA, input as ['University of Maryland College Park', 'College Park, MD'] output is University of Maryland College Park, College Park, MD, USA, input as ['University of Michigan', 'Ann Arbor, MI, USA'] output is University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
