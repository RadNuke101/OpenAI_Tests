Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Summary for Input Column Data:
The input column data consists of names of universities and their respective locations. Each entry includes the name of the university followed by the city, state, and country (if applicable).

Summary for Output Column Data:
The output column data includes the name of the university along with its location, formatted in a consistent manner with the city, state, and country (if applicable) listed.

Relationship between Input and Output:
The input data provides the name and location of various universities, while the output data presents this information in a standardized format. The relationship between the input and output is that the input is transformed into a more structured and uniform output format, making it easier to read and understand the details of each university's location. The output serves as a concise summary of the input data, providing a clear representation of each university's name and location., and input as ['University of Pennsylvania', 'Phialdelphia, PA, USA'] output is University of Pennsylvania, Phialdelphia, PA, USA, input as ['UCLA', 'Los Angeles, CA'] output is UCLA, Los Angeles, CA, USA, input as ['Cornell University', 'Ithaca, New York, USA'] output is Cornell University, Ithaca, New York, USA, input as ['Penn', 'Philadelphia, PA, USA'] output is Penn, Philadelphia, PA, USA, input as ['University of Maryland College Park', 'College Park, MD'] output is University of Maryland College Park, College Park, MD, USA, input as ['University of Michigan', 'Ann Arbor, MI, USA'] output is University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.

    # Format the input data into a consistent output format
    output = name + ', ' + location.replace(',', ', ') + ', USA'
    
    return output
