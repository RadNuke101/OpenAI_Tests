Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Input Column 1 Summary:
The input column 1 consists of various university names such as University of Pennsylvania, UCLA, Cornell University, Penn, University of Maryland College Park, and University of Michigan.

Input Column 2 Summary:
The input column 2 consists of location information for the respective universities such as Philadelphia, PA, USA; Los Angeles, CA, USA; Ithaca, New York, USA; Philadelphia, PA, USA; College Park, MD, USA; and Ann Arbor, MI, USA.

Output Column Summary:
The output column combines the university name and location information to form a complete address for each university. It includes the university name followed by the city, state, and country information.

Relationship between Input and Output:
The input columns contain university names and their respective locations, while the output column combines this information to provide a complete address for each university. The output column essentially merges the information from the input columns to create a comprehensive description of each university's location. This relationship demonstrates how the input data is transformed into a more detailed and informative output format., and input as ['University of Pennsylvania', 'Phialdelphia, PA, USA'] output is University of Pennsylvania, Phialdelphia, PA, USA, input as ['UCLA', 'Los Angeles, CA'] output is UCLA, Los Angeles, CA, USA, input as ['Cornell University', 'Ithaca, New York, USA'] output is Cornell University, Ithaca, New York, USA, input as ['Penn', 'Philadelphia, PA, USA'] output is Penn, Philadelphia, PA, USA, input as ['University of Maryland College Park', 'College Park, MD'] output is University of Maryland College Park, College Park, MD, USA, input as ['University of Michigan', 'Ann Arbor, MI, USA'] output is University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
