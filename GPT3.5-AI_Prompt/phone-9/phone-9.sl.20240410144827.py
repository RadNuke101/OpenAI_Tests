Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: The input data consists of phone numbers in a specific format, with each number starting with a country code followed by three sets of three-digit numbers separated by hyphens. The output data transforms these phone numbers into a different format, with the hyphens replaced by periods.

The relationship between the input and output data is that the output data is a modified version of the input data. The transformation involves changing the hyphens to periods while keeping the country code and the sets of three-digit numbers intact. This transformation makes the phone numbers more visually appealing and easier to read.

Overall, the input data represents phone numbers in a specific format, while the output data represents the same phone numbers in a modified format that enhances readability., and input as ['+106 769-858-438'] output is 106.769.858.438, input as ['+83 973-757-831'] output is 83.973.757.831, input as ['+62 647-787-775'] output is 62.647.787.775, input as ['+172 027-507-632'] output is 172.027.507.632, input as ['+72 001-050-856'] output is 72.001.050.856, input as ['+95 310-537-401'] output is 95.310.537.401, input as ['+6 775-969-238'] output is 6.775.969.238, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
