Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Summary for Input Column Data:
The input column data consists of phone numbers in the format '+XX XXX-XXX-XXX'. Each entry starts with a country code followed by three groups of three digits separated by hyphens. The country codes range from 6 to 172. The input data is consistent in format and structure.

Summary for Output Column Data:
The output column data consists of phone numbers in the format 'XX.XXX.XXX.XXX'. Each entry corresponds to the input phone number with the country code and hyphens removed. The output data maintains the same structure as the input data but in a simplified format.

Relationship between Input and Output:
The relationship between the input and output is a transformation process where the country code and hyphens from the input phone numbers are removed to create the simplified output phone numbers. The output directly corresponds to the input, with each output number being a simplified version of its corresponding input number. The transformation process involves extracting and rearranging the digits from the input to create the output., and input as ['+106 769-858-438'] output is 106.769.858.438, input as ['+83 973-757-831'] output is 83.973.757.831, input as ['+62 647-787-775'] output is 62.647.787.775, input as ['+172 027-507-632'] output is 172.027.507.632, input as ['+72 001-050-856'] output is 72.001.050.856, input as ['+95 310-537-401'] output is 95.310.537.401, input as ['+6 775-969-238'] output is 6.775.969.238, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
