Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Input Column 1 Summary: The names in this column are 'susan' and 'aaron'. Both names are of English origin and are commonly used in Western cultures.

Input Column 2 Summary: The surnames in this column are 'chang' and 'kim'. Both surnames are of Asian origin and are commonly found in countries like China and Korea.

Output Column Summary: The output column combines a first name and a surname to form a full name. The relationship between the input and output columns is that the first name and surname from the input columns are combined to create a full name in the output column. This suggests a connection between the two sets of data, where the first name and surname are linked to form a complete identity., and input as ['susan', 'chang'] output is susan chang, input as ['aaron', 'kim'] output is aaron kim, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.

# Define the function generated_function that takes two arguments, first_name and surname
def generated_function(first_name, surname):
    # Combine the first name and surname to form a full name
    full_name = first_name + ' ' + surname
    # Return the full name
    return full_name

# Test cases
print(generated_function('susan', 'chang')) # Output: susan chang
print(generated_function('aaron', 'kim')) # Output: aaron kim
print(generated_function("susan", "chang"))  ## Output: susan chang
print(generated_function("aaron", "kim"))  ## Output: aaron kim
