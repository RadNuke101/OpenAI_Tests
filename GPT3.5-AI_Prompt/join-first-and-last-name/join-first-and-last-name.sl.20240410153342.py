Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Input Column 1 Summary: The names in this column are 'susan' and 'aaron'. They are both common first names.

Input Column 2 Summary: The surnames in this column are 'chang' and 'kim'. They are both Asian surnames.

Output Column Summary: The output combines a first name and a surname to form a full name. The relationship between the input and output columns is that the first and last names from the input columns are combined to create a full name in the output column. This suggests that the input columns provide the individual components of a person's name, while the output column represents the complete name., and input as ['susan', 'chang'] output is susan chang, input as ['aaron', 'kim'] output is aaron kim, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.

def generated_function(first_name, last_name):
    full_name = first_name + ' ' + last_name
    return full_name

# Test cases
print(generated_function('susan', 'chang'))
print(generated_function('aaron', 'kim'))
print(generated_function("susan", "chang"))  ## Output: susan chang
print(generated_function("aaron", "kim"))  ## Output: aaron kim
