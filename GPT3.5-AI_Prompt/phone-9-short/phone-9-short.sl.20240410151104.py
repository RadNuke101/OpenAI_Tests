Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Summary for input column data:
The input column data consists of phone numbers in the format '+XX YYY-ZZZ-ZZZ', where XX represents the country code, YYY represents the area code, and ZZZ-ZZZ represents the phone number. Each input is unique and follows the same format.

Summary for output column data:
The output column data consists of formatted phone numbers with periods separating the country code, area code, and phone number. The output column data is consistent in its format and structure, with each number correctly formatted.

Relationship between input and output:
The input column data serves as the raw phone numbers that need to be formatted correctly. The output column data shows the correctly formatted phone numbers based on the input. The relationship between the input and output is that the input provides the raw data, and the output transforms this data into a standardized format for easier readability and understanding. The output is directly derived from the input, with each output corresponding to a specific input., and input as ['+106 769-858-438'] output is 106.769.858.438, input as ['+83 973-757-831'] output is 83.973.757.831, input as ['+62 647-787-775'] output is 62.647.787.775, input as ['+172 027-507-632'] output is 172.027.507.632, input as ['+72 001-050-856'] output is 72.001.050.856, input as ['+95 310-537-401'] output is 95.310.537.401, input as ['+6 775-969-238'] output is 6.775.969.238, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
