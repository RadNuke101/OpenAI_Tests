Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Summary for Input Column Data:
- The input column data consists of the word "spreadsheet" split into individual characters.
- Each character in the input column data represents a specific position in the word "spreadsheet".

Summary for Output Column Data:
- The output column data consists of individual characters extracted from the input column data based on the numerical value provided.
- Each output character corresponds to the character in the input column data at the position indicated by the numerical value.

Relationship between Input and Output:
- The relationship between the input column data and the output column data is that the output character is determined by the numerical value provided, which corresponds to the position of the character in the input column data.
- The output column data serves as a way to extract specific characters from the input column data based on the numerical value, providing a way to access individual characters in the word "spreadsheet" based on user input., and input as ['spreadsheet', '1'] output is s, input as ['spreadsheet', '2'] output is p, input as ['spreadsheet', '3'] output is r, input as ['spreadsheet', '4'] output is e, input as ['spreadsheet', '5'] output is a, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.

# Define the generated function

    # Extract the character at the specified position
    output_char = input_str[int(num) - 1]
    return output_char

# Test cases
print(generated_function('spreadsheet', '1'))  # Output: s
print(generated_function('spreadsheet', '2'))  # Output: p
print(generated_function('spreadsheet', '3'))  # Output: r
print(generated_function('spreadsheet', '4'))  # Output: e
print(generated_function('spreadsheet', '5'))  # Output: a
print(generated_function("spreadsheet", "1"))  ## Output: s
print(generated_function("spreadsheet", "2"))  ## Output: p
print(generated_function("spreadsheet", "3"))  ## Output: r
print(generated_function("spreadsheet", "4"))  ## Output: e
print(generated_function("spreadsheet", "5"))  ## Output: a
