Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Summary for input column data:
- The input column data consists of pairs of first and last names.
- Each pair represents a unique individual.

Summary for output column data:
- The output column data consists of full names formed by combining the first and last names from the input.
- The output column represents the full names of individuals.

Relationship between input and output:
- The input column data provides the individual components (first and last names) that are combined to form the output column data (full names).
- The output column data is directly derived from the input column data by concatenating the first and last names.
- The relationship between the input and output is that the input provides the necessary components for creating the output., and input as ['Launa', 'Withers'] output is Launa Withers, input as ['Lakenya', 'Edison'] output is Lakenya Edison, input as ['Brendan', 'Hage'] output is Brendan Hage, input as ['Bradford', 'Lango'] output is Bradford Lango, input as ['Rudolf', 'Akiyama'] output is Rudolf Akiyama, input as ['Lara', 'Constable'] output is Lara Constable, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.

    full_name = first_name + ' ' + last_name
