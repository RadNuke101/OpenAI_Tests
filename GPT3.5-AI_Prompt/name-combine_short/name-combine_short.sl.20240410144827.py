Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Summary for Input Column 1 (First Names):
- The first names in the input column data are unique and diverse, ranging from Launa to Rudolf to Lara.
- There is no apparent pattern or common theme among the first names.

Summary for Input Column 2 (Last Names):
- The last names in the input column data are also varied, including Withers, Edison, Hage, Lango, Akiyama, and Constable.
- Similar to the first names, there is no clear pattern or commonality among the last names.

Summary for Output Column (Full Names):
- The output column combines the first and last names from the input columns to create full names such as Launa Withers, Lakenya Edison, Brendan Hage, Bradford Lango, Rudolf Akiyama, and Lara Constable.
- The relationship between the input and output columns is that the full names are formed by combining the first and last names provided in the input columns.
- The output column showcases the unique combinations of first and last names, resulting in a diverse set of full names., and input as ['Launa', 'Withers'] output is Launa Withers, input as ['Lakenya', 'Edison'] output is Lakenya Edison, input as ['Brendan', 'Hage'] output is Brendan Hage, input as ['Bradford', 'Lango'] output is Bradford Lango, input as ['Rudolf', 'Akiyama'] output is Rudolf Akiyama, input as ['Lara', 'Constable'] output is Lara Constable, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
