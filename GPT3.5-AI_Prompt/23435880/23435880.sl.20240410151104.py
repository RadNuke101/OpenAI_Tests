Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Input Column Summary:
- The first input column contains phrases or sentences related to fruits, specifically apples and oranges.
- The second input column contains single words related to fruits, specifically apples and oranges.

Output Column Summary:
- The output column contains numerical values representing the frequency of the word "orange" in the corresponding input text.

Relationship Summary:
- The relationship between the input and output columns is that the output column counts the occurrences of the word "orange" in the input text provided in the first column.
- The output column value is influenced by the presence and frequency of the word "orange" in the input text, indicating a direct relationship between the input data and the output value.
- The summary suggests that the output value is determined by the qualitative data in the input column, specifically the presence of the word "orange" in the text., and input as ['apple apples', 'apple'] output is 2, input as ['an orange among the oranges is a spoiled orange', 'orange'] output is 3, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.

# Define the generated function
def generated_function(input_text, keyword):
    # Count the occurrences of the keyword in the input text
    count = input_text.count(keyword)
    return count

# Test cases
print(generated_function('apple apples', 'apple'))  # Output: 2
print(generated_function('an orange among the oranges is a spoiled orange', 'orange'))  # Output: 3
print(generated_function("apple apples", "apple"))  ## Output: 2
print(generated_function("an orange among the oranges is a spoiled orange", "orange"))  ## Output: 3
