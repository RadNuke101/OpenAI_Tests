Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Input Column Summary:
- The first input column contains phrases or sentences related to fruits.
- The second input column contains single fruit names.

Output Column Summary:
- The output column represents the frequency of the fruit name appearing in the corresponding input column.

Relationship Summary:
- The output column provides the count of how many times the fruit name from the second input column appears in the phrases or sentences from the first input column.
- The relationship between the input and output columns is that the output column serves as a tally or frequency counter for the occurrences of the fruit name in the input column data., and input as ['apple apples', 'apple'] output is 2, input as ['an orange among the oranges is a spoiled orange', 'orange'] output is 3, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.

# Define the generated function
def generated_function(input_str, fruit):
    # Split the input string into phrases or sentences
    phrases = input_str.split(', ')
    
    # Initialize a counter for the frequency of the fruit name
    count = 0
    
    # Iterate through each phrase or sentence
    for phrase in phrases:
        # Count the occurrences of the fruit name in the phrase
        count += phrase.count(fruit)
    
    # Return the total count of the fruit name in the input data
    return count

# Test cases
print(generated_function('apple apples', 'apple')) # Output: 2
print(generated_function('an orange among the oranges is a spoiled orange', 'orange')) # Output: 3
print(generated_function("apple apples", "apple"))  ## Output: 2
print(generated_function("an orange among the oranges is a spoiled orange", "orange"))  ## Output: 3
