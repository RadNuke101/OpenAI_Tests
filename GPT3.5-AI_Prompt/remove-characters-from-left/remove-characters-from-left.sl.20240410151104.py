Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Summary for Input Column 1:
- The input data in column 1 consists of alphanumeric strings of varying lengths.
- The values in this column include numbers, letters, and special characters.
- There is a mix of different characters in each input string.

Summary for Input Column 2:
- The input data in column 2 consists of single-digit numbers.
- The values in this column are all numerical and range from 1 to 9.

Summary for Output Column:
- The output data consists of alphanumeric strings of varying lengths.
- The values in the output column include letters and numbers.
- The output values are derived from the input values in a way that retains some characters and removes others.

Relationship between Input and Output:
- The output value is derived from the input value in a way that involves removing the characters specified by the single-digit number in column 2.
- The output value retains the characters that are not removed based on the single-digit number.
- The relationship between the input and output is based on a selective removal of characters from the input string to generate the output string., and input as ['1234', '1'] output is 234, input as ['**512A', '2'] output is 512A, input as ['343DMX', '3'] output is DMX, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.

# Define the generated function

        output += char

# Test cases
print(generated_function('1234', '1'))  # Output: 234
print(generated_function('**512A', '2'))  # Output: 512A
print(generated_function('343DMX', '3'))  # Output: DMX
print(generated_function("1234", "1"))  ## Output: 234
print(generated_function("**512A", "2"))  ## Output: 512A
print(generated_function("343DMX", "3"))  ## Output: DMX
