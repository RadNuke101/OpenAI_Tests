Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Summary for Input Column 1:
- The input data in column 1 consists of strings with varying lengths and characters.
- The strings include alphanumeric characters, special characters, and numbers.
- There is a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters in the strings.

Summary for Input Column 2:
- The input data in column 2 consists of single-digit numbers.
- The numbers are represented as strings.

Summary for Output Column:
- The output data consists of strings with varying lengths and characters.
- The output strings include alphanumeric characters and special characters.
- The output does not include any numbers.

Relationship between Input and Output:
- The output column seems to be derived from the input column by removing the first character specified by the number in the second column.
- The output retains the characters following the specified number in the input string.
- The relationship between input and output is based on the position of the specified number in the input string., and input as ['1234', '1'] output is 234, input as ['**512A', '2'] output is 512A, input as ['343DMX', '3'] output is DMX, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.

# Define the generated function
def generated_function(input_str, num_str):
    # Find the index of the number in the input string
    num_index = int(num_str) - 1
    # Return the output string by slicing the input string
    return input_str[num_index+1:]

# Test cases
print(generated_function('1234', '1'))  # Output: 234
print(generated_function('**512A', '2'))  # Output: 512A
print(generated_function('343DMX', '3'))  # Output: DMX
print(generated_function("1234", "1"))  ## Output: 234
print(generated_function("**512A", "2"))  ## Output: 512A
print(generated_function("343DMX", "3"))  ## Output: DMX
