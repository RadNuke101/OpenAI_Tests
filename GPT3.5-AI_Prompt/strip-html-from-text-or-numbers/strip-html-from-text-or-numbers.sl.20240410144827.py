Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Summary for Input Column Data:
The input column data consists of qualitative values enclosed in HTML tags. Each value represents a numerical value with varying decimal points.

Summary for Output Column Data:
The output column data consists of numerical values corresponding to the input values. The output values are decimal numbers with varying precision.

Relationship between Input and Output:
The input values are enclosed in HTML tags, indicating they are meant to be interpreted as numerical values. The output values are the actual numerical representations of the input values. The relationship between the input and output is that the input values are transformed from qualitative representations to quantitative values in the output. The output accurately reflects the decimal precision of the input values., and input as ['<b>0.66<b>'] output is 0.66, input as ['<b>0.409<b>'] output is 0.409, input as ['<b>0.7268<b>'] output is 0.7268, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
