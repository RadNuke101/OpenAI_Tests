Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Summary for Input Column Data:
- The input column data consists of qualitative values enclosed in HTML tags. The values appear to represent numerical data, possibly percentages or decimal numbers.

Summary for Output Column Data:
- The output column data consists of numerical values extracted from the input column data. The values are decimal numbers ranging from 0.409 to 0.7268.

Relationship between Input and Output:
- The input column data contains numerical values represented in a specific format within HTML tags. The output column data is extracted from the input data, converting the qualitative representations into actual numerical values. The relationship between the input and output is that the output column provides the true numerical representation of the values encoded in the input column. The process involves extracting and converting the data from qualitative to quantitative form., and input as ['<b>0.66<b>'] output is 0.66, input as ['<b>0.409<b>'] output is 0.409, input as ['<b>0.7268<b>'] output is 0.7268, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.

# Define the generated function
def generated_function(input_str):
    # Remove HTML tags from the input string
    input_num = float(input_str.replace('<b>', '').replace('</b>', ''))
    
    return input_num

# Test cases
print(generated_function('<b>0.66<b>')) # Output: 0.66
print(generated_function('<b>0.409<b>')) # Output: 0.409
print(generated_function('<b>0.7268<b>')) # Output: 0.7268
print(generated_function("<b>0.66<b>"))  ## Output: 0.66
print(generated_function("<b>0.409<b>"))  ## Output: 0.409
print(generated_function("<b>0.7268<b>"))  ## Output: 0.7268
