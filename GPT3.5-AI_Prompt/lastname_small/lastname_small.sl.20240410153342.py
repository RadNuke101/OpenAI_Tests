Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Summary for Input Column Data:
- The input column data consists of full names of individuals.
- Each entry in the input column represents a unique individual.

Summary for Output Column Data:
- The output column data consists of the last names of the individuals in the input column.
- Each entry in the output column represents the last name of the corresponding individual in the input column.

Relationship between Input and Output:
- The output column data is derived from the last names of the individuals in the input column.
- The output column serves as a way to extract and focus on the last names of the individuals provided in the input column.
- The output column provides a simplified and standardized representation of the last names for further analysis or processing., and input as ['Nancy FreeHafer'] output is FreeHafer, input as ['Andrew Cencici'] output is Cencici, input as ['Jan Kotas'] output is Kotas, input as ['Mariya Sergienko'] output is Sergienko, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.

# Define the generated function
def generated_function(input_str):
    # Split the input string to extract the full name
    full_name = input_str.split()[1:]
    # Join the last name and return it
    return ' '.join(full_name)

# Test cases
print(generated_function('Nancy FreeHafer'))
print(generated_function('Andrew Cencici'))
print(generated_function('Jan Kotas'))
print(generated_function('Mariya Sergienko'))
print(generated_function("Nancy FreeHafer"))  ## Output: FreeHafer
print(generated_function("Andrew Cencici"))  ## Output: Cencici
print(generated_function("Jan Kotas"))  ## Output: Kotas
print(generated_function("Mariya Sergienko"))  ## Output: Sergienko
