Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Input Column Summaries:
1. Valentine Day: A holiday celebrated on February 14th to express love and affection.
2. Movie Blah: A movie title that includes the word "blah" and "The".
3. Year: The year in which the event or movie was released.
4. Rating: The rating given to the event or movie on a scale of 1 to 10.
5. Popularity: The popularity score of the event or movie.
6. Audience: The number of people who have viewed or participated in the event or movie.

Output Column Summary:
- Relationship: The output column seems to be a combination of the input columns, possibly indicating the title or name of the event or movie along with additional information such as year, rating, popularity, and audience. The output column serves as a summary or representation of the input data provided.

Relationship between Input and Output:
The output column appears to be a structured representation of the input data, combining relevant information from each input column to create a cohesive summary. The input data provides details about specific events or movies, while the output column condenses this information into a concise format. The relationship between input and output suggests a transformation process where individual data points are organized and presented in a more streamlined manner for easy reference or analysis., and input as ['valentine day=1915=50==7.1=45'] output is valentine day, input as ['movie blah=2blahblah, The=1914=54==7.9=17'] output is movie blah=2blahblah, The, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.

# Define the generated function

    # Split the input string into individual elements
    input_list = input_str.split('=')
    
    # Extract the relevant information from the input elements
    title = input_list[0]
    year = input_list[1]
    rating = input_list[4]
    popularity = input_list[5]
    audience = input_list[6]
    
    # Create the output string with the extracted information
    output_str = f"{title} ({year}) - Rating: {rating}, Popularity: {popularity}, Audience: {audience}"
    
    return output_str

# Test cases
test_input1 = 'valentine day=1915=50==7.1=45'
test_input2 = 'movie blah=2blahblah, The=1914=54==7.9=17'

# Call the generated function with the test inputs
output1 = generated_function(test_input1)
output2 = generated_function(test_input2)
print(generated_function("valentine day=1915=50==7.1=45"))  ## Output: valentine day
print(generated_function("movie blah=2blahblah, The=1914=54==7.9=17"))  ## Output: movie blah=2blahblah, The
