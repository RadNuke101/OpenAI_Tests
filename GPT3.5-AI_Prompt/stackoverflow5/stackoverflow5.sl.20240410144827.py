Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Input Column Summaries:
1. Valentine Day: A special day celebrated in 1915 with a rating of 7.1 out of 10 and 45 reviews.
2. Movie Blah: A movie titled "Blah" released in 1914 with a rating of 7.9 out of 10 and 17 reviews.

Output Column Summary:
- The output column combines the titles "Valentine Day" and "Movie Blah=2blahblah, The" from the input data.

Relationship between Input and Output:
The input data consists of specific events or entities (Valentine Day and Movie Blah) with associated details. The output combines these elements into a single string, possibly suggesting a connection or comparison between the two. This relationship could indicate a thematic or contextual link between Valentine's Day and the movie "Blah." The output may be presenting a juxtaposition or contrast between the romantic holiday and the film, potentially highlighting different aspects of love and entertainment., and input as ['valentine day=1915=50==7.1=45'] output is valentine day, input as ['movie blah=2blahblah, The=1914=54==7.9=17'] output is movie blah=2blahblah, The, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
