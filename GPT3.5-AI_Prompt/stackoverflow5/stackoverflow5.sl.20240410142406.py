Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Input Column Summaries:
1. Valentine Day: A special day celebrated in 1915 with a rating of 7.1 out of 10 and a popularity score of 45.
2. Movie Blah: A movie titled "Blah" released in 1914 with a rating of 7.9 out of 10 and a popularity score of 17.

Output Column Summary:
- The output column combines the input data into a single string, including the title and release year of a movie or event, along with its associated ratings and popularity scores.

Relationship between Input and Output:
The input data provides specific details about different events or movies, while the output column combines this information into a concise summary. The output column serves as a way to present a condensed version of the input data, highlighting key aspects such as titles, release years, ratings, and popularity scores. The relationship between the input and output is one of transformation, where the input details are organized and presented in a more structured format in the output., and input as ['valentine day=1915=50==7.1=45'] output is valentine day, input as ['movie blah=2blahblah, The=1914=54==7.9=17'] output is movie blah=2blahblah, The, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.

        popularity_score = input_data[5]
        output += f"{title}, The ({release_year}), Rating: {rating}, Popularity Score: {popularity_score}\n"
    return output
