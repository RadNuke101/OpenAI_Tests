Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Input Column Summaries:
1. Valentine Day: A holiday celebrated on February 14th to express love and affection.
2. Movie Blah=2blahblah, The: A movie title that includes the word "blah" and "The".
3. Year: The year in which the event or movie was released.
4. Rating: The rating given to the event or movie, possibly by critics or audiences.
5. Popularity: The popularity level of the event or movie, indicated by a numerical value.

Output Column Summary:
- Relationship: The output column seems to be a combination of the input columns, possibly representing a title or name of an event or movie. It includes elements from the input columns such as the event or movie title, year, and additional details like the rating and popularity. The output column serves as a concise summary or representation of the input data.

Overall Relationship:
- The input data provides specific details about events or movies, such as titles, years, ratings, and popularity levels. The output column combines these details into a single summary, possibly representing a condensed version of the input data. The relationship between the input and output columns is one of consolidation and summarization, where the output column serves as a concise representation of the input data., and input as ['valentine day=1915=50==7.1=45'] output is valentine day, input as ['movie blah=2blahblah, The=1914=54==7.9=17'] output is movie blah=2blahblah, The, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.

# Call the generated function with the test inputs
output_1 = generated_function(test_input_1)
output_2 = generated_function(test_input_2)
print(generated_function("valentine day=1915=50==7.1=45"))  ## Output: valentine day
print(generated_function("movie blah=2blahblah, The=1914=54==7.9=17"))  ## Output: movie blah=2blahblah, The
