Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Summary for Input Column 1:
The input column 1 contains names of individuals. The names are in the format of first name followed by last name, separated by a space.

Summary for Input Column 2:
The input column 2 contains email addresses. The email addresses are in the format of username followed by domain, separated by an underscore or a dot.

Summary for Output Column:
The output column contains usernames extracted from the email addresses in input column 2. The usernames are typically the first part of the email address before the separator.

Relationship between Input and Output:
The output usernames are derived from the email addresses in input column 2 by extracting the username part. The usernames do not always match the first names in input column 1, as they are based on the email addresses. However, in some cases, the usernames do match the first names. The relationship between input and output is that the output usernames are a part of the email addresses provided in the input., and input as ['ann chang', 'achang_maaker.com'] output is achang, input as ['bobby smith', 'bobt_sphynx.uk.co'] output is bobt, input as ['art lennox', 'art.lennox_svxn.com'] output is art.lennox, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.

# Define the generated function
def generated_function(input_name, input_email):
    # Split the email address to extract the username
    username = input_email.split('@')[0]
    
    # Replace underscore with dot if present
    username = username.replace('_', '.')
    
    return username

# Test cases
print(generated_function('ann chang', 'achang_maaker.com'))
print(generated_function('bobby smith', 'bobt_sphynx.uk.co'))
print(generated_function('art lennox', 'art.lennox_svxn.com'))
print(generated_function("ann chang", "achang_maaker.com"))  ## Output: achang
print(generated_function("bobby smith", "bobt_sphynx.uk.co"))  ## Output: bobt
print(generated_function("art lennox", "art.lennox_svxn.com"))  ## Output: art.lennox
