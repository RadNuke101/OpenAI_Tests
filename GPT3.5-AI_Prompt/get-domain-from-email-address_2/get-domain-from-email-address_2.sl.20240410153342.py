Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Input Column Summary:
- The input column data consists of full names followed by email addresses.
- The full names are in the format of first name followed by last name.
- The email addresses vary in format, but they all seem to have a name component followed by a domain component.

Output Column Summary:
- The output column consists of the name component extracted from the email addresses.
- The extracted name component seems to be the first part of the email address before the "@" symbol.

Relationship between Input and Output:
- The output column is derived from the email addresses provided in the input column.
- It appears that the name component extracted from the email addresses is the part before the "@" symbol, which may or may not be related to the full name provided.
- The relationship between the input and output seems to be based on extracting a specific part of the email address, possibly for identification or categorization purposes., and input as ['ann chang', 'achang_maaker.com'] output is achang, input as ['bobby smith', 'bobt_sphynx.uk.co'] output is bobt, input as ['art lennox', 'art.lennox_svxn.com'] output is art.lennox, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
