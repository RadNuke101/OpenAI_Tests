Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Summary for Input Column Data:
- The input column data consists of phrases or sentences.
- Each phrase or sentence contains a string of words.
- The phrases or sentences may or may not contain the target word or phrase.

Summary for Output Column Data:
- The output column data consists of boolean values (true or false).
- The output value is true if the target word or phrase is found in the corresponding input phrase or sentence, and false otherwise.

Relationship between Input and Output:
- The relationship between the input and output is based on whether the target word or phrase is present in the input phrase or sentence.
- If the target word or phrase is found in the input, the output is true; if not found, the output is false.
- The output serves as an indicator of whether the target word or phrase is present in the input data., and input as ['An apple a day keeps the doctor away', 'apple'] output is true, input as ['An apple a day keeps the doctor away', 'orange'] output is false, input as ['Better the devil you know', 'you know'] output is true, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.

# Define the generated function
def generated_function(input_str, target_str):
    # Check if the target word or phrase is present in the input phrase or sentence
    if target_str in input_str:
        return True
    else:
        return False

# Test cases
print(generated_function('An apple a day keeps the doctor away', 'apple'))  # Output: True
print(generated_function('An apple a day keeps the doctor away', 'orange'))  # Output: False
print(generated_function('Better the devil you know', 'you know'))  # Output: True
print(generated_function("An apple a day keeps the doctor away", "apple"))  ## Output: true
print(generated_function("An apple a day keeps the doctor away", "orange"))  ## Output: false
print(generated_function("Better the devil you know", "you know"))  ## Output: true
