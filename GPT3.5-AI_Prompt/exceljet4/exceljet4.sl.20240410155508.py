Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Summary for Input Column Data:
- The input column data consists of URLs with different protocols such as https, ftp, and sftp.
- Each input is a combination of a protocol followed by a domain name or IP address.

Summary for Output Column Data:
- The output column data consists of domain names and IP addresses extracted from the input URLs.
- The output column represents the main part of the URL after the protocol, which can be a domain name or an IP address.

Relationship between Input and Output:
- The input column data provides the context for the output column by specifying the protocol used in the URL.
- The output column data is derived from the input column data by extracting the domain name or IP address after the protocol.
- The relationship between the input and output is that the output is a subset of the input, representing the main part of the URL., and input as ['https=//exceljet.net/catalog'] output is exceljet.net/catalog, input as ['https=//microsoft.com'] output is microsoft.com, input as ['ftp=//someserver.com'] output is someserver.com, input as ['sftp=//127.0.0.1'] output is 127.0.0.1, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.

# Define the generated function
def generated_function(input_str):
    # Split the input string by '=' to separate the protocol and URL
    protocol, url = input_str.split('=')
    
    # Extract the domain name or IP address from the URL
    if '//' in url:
        output = url.split('//')[1]
    else:
        output = url
    
    return output

# Test cases
input1 = 'https=//exceljet.net/catalog'
input2 = 'https=//microsoft.com'
input3 = 'ftp=//someserver.com'
input4 = 'sftp=//127.0.0.1'

# Call the generated function with test cases
output1 = generated_function(input1)
output2 = generated_function(input2)
output3 = generated_function(input3)
output4 = generated_function(input4)
print(generated_function("https=//exceljet.net/catalog"))  ## Output: exceljet.net/catalog
print(generated_function("https=//microsoft.com"))  ## Output: microsoft.com
print(generated_function("ftp=//someserver.com"))  ## Output: someserver.com
print(generated_function("sftp=//127.0.0.1"))  ## Output: 127.0.0.1
