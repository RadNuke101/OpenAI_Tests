Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: The input data consists of URLs with different protocols such as 'https', 'ftp', and 'sftp'. The output column contains the domain names extracted from the URLs. The relationship between the input and output is that the output column represents the main domain name of the URLs provided in the input column, regardless of the protocol used. The summary for the input columns indicates the variety of protocols used in the URLs, while the summary for the output column highlights the extracted domain names. Overall, the input data showcases a range of URLs with different protocols, while the output column simplifies this information by focusing on the domain names., and input as ['https=//exceljet.net/catalog'] output is exceljet.net/catalog, input as ['https=//microsoft.com'] output is microsoft.com, input as ['ftp=//someserver.com'] output is someserver.com, input as ['sftp=//127.0.0.1'] output is 127.0.0.1, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.

# Define the function to extract domain names from URLs with different protocols
def generated_function(input_str):
    # Split the input string by '=' to separate the protocol and URL
    protocol, url = input_str.split('=')
    
    # Remove any leading slashes from the URL
    url = url.lstrip('/')
    
    # Extract the domain name from the URL
    domain = url.split('/')[0]
