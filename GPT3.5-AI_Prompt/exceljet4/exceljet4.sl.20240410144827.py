Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Summary for Input Column Data:
- The input column data consists of URLs with different protocols such as https, ftp, and sftp.
- Each input value is a combination of a protocol followed by a URL separated by an equal sign.
- The URLs in the input data vary in terms of domain names and IP addresses.

Summary for Output Column Data:
- The output column data consists of extracted domain names and IP addresses from the input URLs.
- The output values are the main components of the input URLs after the equal sign.
- The output column provides a simplified version of the input URLs by removing the protocol information.

Relationship between Input and Output:
- The input URLs contain additional information such as protocols, which are not present in the output.
- The output column focuses on extracting the essential components of the input URLs, namely domain names and IP addresses.
- The relationship between the input and output is that the output column simplifies the input URLs by extracting only the relevant information needed for identification., and input as ['https=//exceljet.net/catalog'] output is exceljet.net/catalog, input as ['https=//microsoft.com'] output is microsoft.com, input as ['ftp=//someserver.com'] output is someserver.com, input as ['sftp=//127.0.0.1'] output is 127.0.0.1, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.

# Define the generated function
def generated_function(input_str):
    # Split the input string by '=' to extract the domain name or IP address
    output = input_str.split('=')[1].strip()
    
    return output

# Test cases
print(generated_function('https=//exceljet.net/catalog')) # Output: exceljet.net/catalog
print(generated_function('https=//microsoft.com')) # Output: microsoft.com
print(generated_function('ftp=//someserver.com')) # Output: someserver.com
print(generated_function('sftp=//127.0.0.1')) # Output: 127.0.0.1
print(generated_function("https=//exceljet.net/catalog"))  ## Output: exceljet.net/catalog
print(generated_function("https=//microsoft.com"))  ## Output: microsoft.com
print(generated_function("ftp=//someserver.com"))  ## Output: someserver.com
print(generated_function("sftp=//127.0.0.1"))  ## Output: 127.0.0.1
