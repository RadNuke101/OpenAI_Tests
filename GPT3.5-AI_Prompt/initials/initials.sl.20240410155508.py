Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Summary for Input Column Data:
- The input column data consists of full names of individuals.
- Each full name is in the format of First Name followed by Last Name.

Summary for Output Column Data:
- The output column data consists of initials derived from the input full names.
- Each set of initials is in the format of First Initial followed by Last Initial.

Relationship between Input and Output:
- The relationship between the input full names and the output initials is that the initials are derived from the first letters of the first and last names.
- The output initials provide a concise representation of the corresponding full names.
- This process simplifies the data while retaining the essential information of the individuals' names., and input as ['Nancy FreeHafer'] output is N.F., input as ['Andrew Cencici'] output is A.C., input as ['Jan Kotas'] output is J.K., input as ['Mariya Sergienko'] output is M.S., , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.

# Define the generated function
def generated_function(input_str):
    # Split the input full name into first name and last name
    first_name, last_name = input_str.split()
    
    # Get the first initial of the first name and last name
    first_initial = first_name[0]
    last_initial = last_name[0]
    
    # Return the output initials in the format of First Initial followed by Last Initial
    return f"{first_initial}.{last_initial}"

# Test cases
print(generated_function('Nancy FreeHafer'))  # Output: N.F.
print(generated_function('Andrew Cencici'))   # Output: A.C.
print(generated_function('Jan Kotas'))        # Output: J.K.
