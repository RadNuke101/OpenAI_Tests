Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Summary for Input Column 1:
The input column data consists of different types of vehicle maintenance equipment or components, such as tire pressure monitors, oil life gauges, and air conditioner maintenance. Each input contains a unique alphanumeric code embedded within the description.

Summary for Output Column:
The output column consists of alphanumeric codes extracted from the input column data. These codes serve as identifiers for the specific maintenance equipment or components mentioned in the input.

Relationship between Input and Output:
The alphanumeric codes extracted from the input column data are unique identifiers associated with specific maintenance equipment or components. The codes serve as a reference point to distinguish between different types of maintenance tasks or equipment. The relationship between the input and output is that the output provides a concise representation of the specific maintenance equipment or component mentioned in the input., and input as ['Tire Pressure ABC123873 Monitor'] output is ABC123873, input as [' Oil Life ABC849999999021 gauge'] output is ABC849999999021, input as [' Air conditioner GHF211 maintenance'] output is GHF211, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
