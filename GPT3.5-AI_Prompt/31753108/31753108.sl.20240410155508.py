Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Summary for Input Column 1:
The input column data consists of descriptions related to different car parts or maintenance tasks. Each description includes a combination of words and alphanumeric characters.

Summary for Output Column:
The output column data consists of alphanumeric codes that are extracted from the input descriptions. These codes are unique identifiers associated with specific car parts or maintenance tasks.

Relationship between Input and Output:
The output column codes are extracted from the input descriptions by identifying and isolating the alphanumeric sequences within the text. The codes serve as a shorthand way to reference the specific car parts or maintenance tasks mentioned in the input descriptions. This relationship allows for quick and efficient identification of the relevant information within the input data., and input as ['Tire Pressure ABC123873 Monitor'] output is ABC123873, input as [' Oil Life ABC849999999021 gauge'] output is ABC849999999021, input as [' Air conditioner GHF211 maintenance'] output is GHF211, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
