Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: For the input column data, the summary for the first column ['ABC', 'D'] is that it contains a mix of strings of different lengths and characters. The summary for the second column ['ABC', 'BC'] is that both strings are of the same length and contain similar characters.

The relationship between the input and the output is that the output is determined by whether the second string in the input column is a substring of the first string. In the first case, 'D' is not a substring of 'ABC', so the output is false. In the second case, 'BC' is a substring of 'ABC', so the output is true. Therefore, the output is based on the presence or absence of a substring relationship between the two strings in the input column., and input as ['ABC', 'D'] output is false, input as ['ABC', 'BC'] output is true, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.

# Define the generated function
def generated_function(input_str1, input_str2):
    # Check if input_str2 is a substring of input_str1
    if input_str2 in input_str1:
        return True
    else:
        return False

# Test cases
print(generated_function('ABC', 'D'))  # Output: False
print(generated_function('ABC', 'BC'))  # Output: True
print(generated_function("ABC", "D"))  ## Output: false
print(generated_function("ABC", "BC"))  ## Output: true
