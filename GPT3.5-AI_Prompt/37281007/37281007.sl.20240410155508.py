Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Summary for Input Column Data:
- The input column data consists of strings representing different values.
- The values in the input column data are not numerical but qualitative in nature.
- Each value in the input column data is unique and distinct from the others.

Summary for Output Column Data:
- The output column data consists of boolean values (true or false) indicating the relationship between the input values.
- The output column data is based on comparing the input values and determining if they meet a specific condition.

Relationship between Input and Output:
- The output is determined by whether the second value in the input list is a substring of the first value.
- If the second value is a substring of the first value, the output is true; otherwise, it is false.
- The relationship between the input and output is based on the presence of a specific pattern or relationship between the input values.
- The output serves as a way to indicate whether the second value is contained within the first value in the input list., and input as ['ABC', 'D'] output is false, input as ['ABC', 'BC'] output is true, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.

# Define the generated function
def generated_function(input_str1, input_str2):
    # Check if the second input string is a substring of the first input string
    if input_str2 in input_str1:
        return True
    else:
        return False

# Test cases
print(generated_function('ABC', 'D'))  # Output: False
print(generated_function('ABC', 'BC'))  # Output: True
print(generated_function("ABC", "D"))  ## Output: false
print(generated_function("ABC", "BC"))  ## Output: true
