Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Summary for Input Column Data:
- The input column data consists of various alphanumeric strings with different formats, such as codes, abbreviations, and numbers.
- The input data includes words like CAP, BOX, PAX, and other similar terms that seem to represent different categories or types of items.
- The input data also includes specific identifiers like numbers and codes, which may be used for tracking or categorizing purposes.

Summary for Output Column Data:
- The output column data consists of specific terms like PAX, BOX, and SSKA, which appear to be related to the items mentioned in the input column data.
- The output data seems to represent the final item or category that is being referred to in the input data.
- The output data may be a key identifier or category that helps differentiate or categorize the items mentioned in the input data.

Relationship between Input and Output:
- The relationship between the input and output data appears to be that the output column data represents the final item or category that is being referred to in the input column data.
- The output data seems to be a summary or key identifier that helps describe or categorize the items mentioned in the input data.
- The input data provides context and details about various items, while the output data serves as a concise summary or key identifier for those items., and input as ['2283-332-44543 CAP DDT PPL445_ HEEN PAX 77820'] output is HEEN PAX 77820, input as ['44372-33-3223 TYYTE CAP BOX 1550 244 BOX PPSSA223_ PAX'] output is PAX, input as ['PRECISE 77 CLEAR BLUE 99WIE_ BOX 4403 PAX SSKA'] output is BOX 4403 PAX SSKA, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
