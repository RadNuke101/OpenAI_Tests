Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Input Column 1 Summary:
The input column contains strings of varying lengths, with each string separated by a forward slash (/). The strings consist of uppercase letters from A to Z.

Output Column Summary:
The output column contains a single string of uppercase letters from A to Z.

Relationship Summary:
The output column appears to be the last string in the input column. The relationship between the input and output is that the output is always the last string in the input column. This pattern suggests that the output is derived from the last element in the input column., and input as ['ABCDE/FGHI/JKL/MNOPQR'] output is MNOPQR, input as ['A/ABCDE/FGHI/JKL'] output is JKL, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
