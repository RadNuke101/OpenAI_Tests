Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Summary for Input Column 1:
- The input data in column 1 consists of strings separated by slashes.
- The strings in column 1 vary in length and content, with no clear pattern or relationship between them.

Summary for Output Column:
- The output column contains the last string in each input row, which is separated by slashes.
- The output column consistently shows the last string from each input row.

Relationship between Input and Output:
- The output column is derived from the last string in each input row.
- The relationship between the input and output is that the output is always the last string in the input row, regardless of the content or length of the other strings in the row., and input as ['ABCDE/FGHI/JKL/MNOPQR'] output is MNOPQR, input as ['A/ABCDE/FGHI/JKL'] output is JKL, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
