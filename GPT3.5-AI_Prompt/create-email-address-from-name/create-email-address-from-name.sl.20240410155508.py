Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Summary for Input Column 1 (['brown', 'traci', 'thomas', 'linda', 'ward', 'jack']):
The input column 1 consists of various names such as 'brown', 'traci', 'thomas', 'linda', 'ward', and 'jack'. These names are diverse and do not follow a specific pattern or relationship.

Summary for Input Column 2 (['brown', 'traci', 'thomas', 'linda', 'ward', 'jack']):
The input column 2 also consists of various names such as 'brown', 'traci', 'thomas', 'linda', 'ward', and 'jack'. Similar to column 1, these names are diverse and do not follow a specific pattern or relationship.

Summary for Output Column ('tbrown_acme.com', 'lthomas_acme.com', 'jward_acme.com'):
The output column consists of email addresses generated by combining the first letter of the second input column with the full name from the first input column followed by '_acme.com'. The output column shows a clear relationship between the input columns and the output, where the first letter of the second input column is combined with the full name from the first input column to create the email address., and input as ['brown', 'traci'] output is tbrown_acme.com, input as ['thomas', 'linda'] output is lthomas_acme.com, input as ['ward', 'jack'] output is jward_acme.com, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.

# Define the generated function
def generated_function(name1, name2):
    # Combine the first letter of name2 with name1 and add '_acme.com'
    email = name2[0] + name1 + '_acme.com'
    return email

# Test cases
print(generated_function('brown', 'traci'))  # Output: tbrown_acme.com
print(generated_function('thomas', 'linda'))  # Output: lthomas_acme.com
print(generated_function('ward', 'jack'))  # Output: jward_acme.com
print(generated_function("brown", "traci"))  ## Output: tbrown_acme.com
print(generated_function("thomas", "linda"))  ## Output: lthomas_acme.com
print(generated_function("ward", "jack"))  ## Output: jward_acme.com
