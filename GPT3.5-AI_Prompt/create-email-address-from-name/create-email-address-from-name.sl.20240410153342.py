Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Summary for Input Column 1 (First Names):
- The first names in the input column are 'brown', 'traci', 'thomas', 'linda', 'ward', and 'jack'.
- The names appear to be a mix of male and female names.

Summary for Input Column 2 (Last Names):
- The last names in the input column are 'brown', 'traci', 'thomas', 'linda', 'ward', and 'jack'.
- The last names appear to be a mix of surnames and first names.

Summary for Output Column (Email Addresses):
- The output column consists of email addresses in the format of [first letter of last name][full first name]_acme.com.
- The email addresses are unique for each input pair.
- The email addresses follow a consistent pattern based on the input data.

Relationship between Input and Output:
- The output email addresses are generated by combining the first letter of the last name with the full first name followed by '_acme.com'.
- The output email addresses provide a personalized and unique email address for each input pair.
- The relationship between the input data and the output email addresses is systematic and follows a specific pattern., and input as ['brown', 'traci'] output is tbrown_acme.com, input as ['thomas', 'linda'] output is lthomas_acme.com, input as ['ward', 'jack'] output is jward_acme.com, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
