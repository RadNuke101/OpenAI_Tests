Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Input Column 1 Summary:
The input column 1 consists of names such as 'brown', 'traci', 'thomas', 'linda', 'ward', and 'jack'. These names appear to be a mix of first names and last names.

Input Column 2 Summary:
The input column 2 consists of names such as 'traci', 'linda', and 'jack'. These names also appear to be a mix of first names and last names.

Output Column Summary:
The output column consists of email addresses in the format of [first letter of input name][last name]@acme.com. For example, 'tbrown_acme.com' corresponds to the input 'brown'. 

Relationship between Input and Output:
The output email addresses are generated by taking the first letter of the second input name and combining it with the first input name followed by '_acme.com'. This relationship suggests that the email addresses are personalized based on the input names provided., and input as ['brown', 'traci'] output is tbrown_acme.com, input as ['thomas', 'linda'] output is lthomas_acme.com, input as ['ward', 'jack'] output is jward_acme.com, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.

# Define the generated function
def generated_function(input1, input2):
    # Generate the email address based on the input names
    output = input2[0][0] + input1 + '_acme.com'
    return output

# Test cases
print(generated_function('brown', 'traci'))
print(generated_function('thomas', 'linda'))
print(generated_function('ward', 'jack'))
print(generated_function("brown", "traci"))  ## Output: tbrown_acme.com
print(generated_function("thomas", "linda"))  ## Output: lthomas_acme.com
print(generated_function("ward", "jack"))  ## Output: jward_acme.com
