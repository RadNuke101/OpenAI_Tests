Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Input Column Summary:
- The input column data consists of strings with a combination of letters and numbers.
- The strings vary in length and content, with some containing repeating characters like 'd', 'f', and 's'.

Output Column Summary:
- The output column contains boolean values (true or false) based on certain criteria.
- The output is true when the input string contains a sequence of 9s, such as '9999999'.
- The output is false when the input string does not contain a sequence of 9s.

Relationship Summary:
- The relationship between the input and output is based on the presence of a specific pattern in the input string.
- If the input string contains a sequence of 9s, the output is true.
- If the input string does not contain a sequence of 9s, the output is false.
- The output is directly determined by the content of the input string, specifically the presence of the sequence '9999999'., and input as ['dhfjd9999999dfda'] output is true, input as ['ddsss999dfdfsfd'] output is false, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
