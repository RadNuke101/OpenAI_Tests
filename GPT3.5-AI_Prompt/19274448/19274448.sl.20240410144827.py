Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Summary for Input Column Data:
- The input column data consists of strings that contain a mix of letters and numbers.
- The strings vary in length and may have different patterns of characters.

Summary for Output Column Data:
- The output column data consists of boolean values (true or false) indicating a specific condition.
- The output value is determined based on the presence of a certain pattern or condition in the input string.

Relationship between Input and Output:
- The output value is determined by whether the input string contains a specific pattern or condition.
- In this case, the output is true if the input string contains a sequence of 9s followed by 'dfda', and false otherwise.
- The relationship between input and output is based on the presence or absence of a specific pattern in the input data., and input as ['dhfjd9999999dfda'] output is true, input as ['ddsss999dfdfsfd'] output is false, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
