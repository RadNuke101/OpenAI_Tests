Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Summary for Input Column Data:
- The input column data consists of strings that contain a combination of letters and numbers.
- The strings vary in length and may include special characters like 'd', 'f', 's', and '9'.
- The strings do not follow a specific pattern or format.

Summary for Output Column Data:
- The output column data consists of boolean values (true or false) based on certain criteria.
- The output is 'true' when the input string contains a sequence of nine consecutive '9's.
- The output is 'false' when the input string does not contain a sequence of nine consecutive '9's.

Relationship between Input and Output:
- The relationship between the input and output is based on the presence of a specific pattern within the input string.
- The output is determined by whether the input string contains nine consecutive '9's or not.
- If the input string contains nine consecutive '9's, the output is 'true'; otherwise, the output is 'false'.
- The presence of the pattern of nine consecutive '9's in the input string directly influences the output value., and input as ['dhfjd9999999dfda'] output is true, input as ['ddsss999dfdfsfd'] output is false, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
