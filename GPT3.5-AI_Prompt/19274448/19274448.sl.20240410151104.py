Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Input Column Summary:
- The input column data consists of strings that contain a mix of letters and numbers.
- The strings are of varying lengths and do not follow a specific pattern.
- Some strings contain a mix of letters and numbers, while others contain only letters or only numbers.

Output Column Summary:
- The output column consists of boolean values (True or False) based on the input data.
- The output is True when the input string contains a sequence of 9s followed by letters, and False otherwise.

Relationship Summary:
- The relationship between the input and output columns is based on the presence of a specific pattern in the input data.
- The output is determined by whether the input string contains a sequence of 9s followed by letters.
- If the input string meets this criteria, the output is True; otherwise, it is False.
- The output column serves as a filter to identify specific patterns in the input data., and input as ['dhfjd9999999dfda'] output is true, input as ['ddsss999dfdfsfd'] output is false, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
