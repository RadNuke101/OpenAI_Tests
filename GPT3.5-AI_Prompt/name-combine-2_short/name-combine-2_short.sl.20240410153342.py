Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Summary for Input Column 1 (First Names):
- The input column 1 consists of first names such as Nancy, Andrew, Jan, and Mariya.

Summary for Input Column 2 (Last Names):
- The input column 2 consists of last names such as FreeHafer, Cencici, Kotas, and Sergienko.

Summary for Output Column (First Initial of First Name and Last Name):
- The output column combines the first initial of the first name with the last name, such as Nancy F., Andrew C., Jan K., and Mariya S.

Relationship between Input and Output:
- The relationship between the input and output is that the output column combines the first initial of the first name with the last name to create a new representation of the individual's name. This relationship simplifies the full name into a more concise format while still preserving the individual's identity., and input as ['Nancy', 'FreeHafer'] output is Nancy F., input as ['Andrew', 'Cencici'] output is Andrew C., input as ['Jan', 'Kotas'] output is Jan K., input as ['Mariya', 'Sergienko'] output is Mariya S., , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.

print(generated_function('Mariya', 'Sergienko')) # Output: Mariya S.
print(generated_function("Nancy", "FreeHafer"))  ## Output: Nancy F.
print(generated_function("Andrew", "Cencici"))  ## Output: Andrew C.
print(generated_function("Jan", "Kotas"))  ## Output: Jan K.
print(generated_function("Mariya", "Sergienko"))  ## Output: Mariya S.
