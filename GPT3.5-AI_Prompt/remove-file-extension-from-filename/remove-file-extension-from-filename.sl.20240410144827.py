Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Input Column Data Summaries:
1. ['happy.jpg']: The input column contains the word "happy" extracted from the file name "happy.jpg".
2. ['pivot table.xls']: The input column contains the phrase "pivot table" extracted from the file name "pivot table.xls".
3. ['sales data.csv']: The input column contains the phrase "sales data" extracted from the file name "sales data.csv".
4. ['invoice3001.xls.pdf']: The input column contains the phrase "invoice3001" extracted from the file name "invoice3001.xls.pdf".

Output Column Summary:
The output column contains the extracted keywords or phrases from the input file names, such as "happy", "pivot table", "sales data", and "invoice3001".

Relationship Summary:
The output column appears to be derived from the input file names by extracting relevant keywords or phrases. The output serves as a summary or representation of the content or purpose of the input files. This relationship suggests that the output is a condensed version or key identifier of the input data., and input as ['happy.jpg'] output is happy, input as ['pivot table.xls'] output is pivot table, input as ['sales data.csv'] output is sales data, input as ['invoice3001.xls.pdf'] output is invoice3001, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.

# Define the generated function
def generated_function(input_str):
    # Extract the keyword or phrase from the input file name
    output = input_str.split('.')[0]
    
    # Return the extracted keyword or phrase
    return output

# Test cases
print(generated_function('happy.jpg'))  # Output: happy
print(generated_function('pivot table.xls'))  # Output: pivot table
print(generated_function('sales data.csv'))  # Output: sales data
print(generated_function('invoice3001.xls.pdf'))  # Output: invoice3001
print(generated_function("happy.jpg"))  ## Output: happy
print(generated_function("pivot table.xls"))  ## Output: pivot table
print(generated_function("sales data.csv"))  ## Output: sales data
print(generated_function("invoice3001.xls.pdf"))  ## Output: invoice3001
