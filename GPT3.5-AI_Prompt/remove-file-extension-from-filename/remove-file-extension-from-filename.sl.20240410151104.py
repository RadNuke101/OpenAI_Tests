Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: **Input Column Data Summary:**

1. ['happy.jpg'] - The input column data consists of a single entry, 'happy.jpg', which appears to be a file name related to happiness or joy.

2. ['pivot table.xls'] - The input column data consists of a single entry, 'pivot table.xls', which likely refers to a spreadsheet file containing a pivot table.

3. ['sales data.csv'] - The input column data consists of a single entry, 'sales data.csv', which suggests a file containing sales data in CSV format.

4. ['invoice3001.xls.pdf'] - The input column data consists of a single entry, 'invoice3001.xls.pdf', which appears to be a file name related to an invoice numbered 3001.

**Output Column Data Summary:**

1. happy - The output column data consists of the words 'happy', 'pivot table', 'sales data', and 'invoice3001', which are likely keywords or descriptors related to the input data.

**Relationship Summary:**

The output column data seems to be derived from the input column data by extracting relevant keywords or descriptors. Each output entry appears to be a simplified version of the corresponding input entry, focusing on the key information or topic conveyed in the input. This relationship suggests a process of summarization or abstraction, where the output provides a concise representation of the input data., and input as ['happy.jpg'] output is happy, input as ['pivot table.xls'] output is pivot table, input as ['sales data.csv'] output is sales data, input as ['invoice3001.xls.pdf'] output is invoice3001, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.

# Define the generated function

    # Remove file extensions and special characters from the input string
    input_str = input_str.replace('.jpg', '').replace('.xls', '').replace('.csv', '').replace('.pdf', '')
    
    # Return the simplified version of the input string
    return input_str

# Test cases

print(generated_function('pivot table.xls'))  # Output: pivot table
print(generated_function('sales data.csv'))  # Output: sales data
print(generated_function('invoice3001.xls.pdf'))  # Output: invoice3001
print(generated_function("happy.jpg"))  ## Output: happy
print(generated_function("pivot table.xls"))  ## Output: pivot table
print(generated_function("sales data.csv"))  ## Output: sales data
