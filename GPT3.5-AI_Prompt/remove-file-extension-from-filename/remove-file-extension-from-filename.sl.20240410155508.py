Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: **Input Column Summary:**

1. ['happy.jpg']: The input column contains filenames with a single word describing the content or subject matter of an image.

2. ['pivot table.xls']: The input column contains filenames with a two-word combination, where the first word describes a type of data analysis or organizational tool, and the second word is a file extension.

3. ['sales data.csv']: The input column contains filenames with a two-word combination, where the first word describes a type of data related to business transactions, and the second word is a file extension.

4. ['invoice3001.xls.pdf']: The input column contains filenames with a combination of a word related to financial documents and a numerical identifier, followed by two file extensions.

**Output Column Summary:**

The output column contains the extracted keywords from the input filenames, which are 'happy', 'pivot table', 'sales data', and 'invoice3001'.

**Relationship Summary:**

The relationship between the input and output columns is that the output column provides a concise summary or keyword extracted from the input filenames. The output column serves as a simplified representation of the content or subject matter described in the input filenames. By extracting key words from the input filenames, the output column helps to categorize and identify the main theme or topic of the files. This relationship demonstrates the process of extracting relevant information from qualitative data to create a more organized and structured summary., and input as ['happy.jpg'] output is happy, input as ['pivot table.xls'] output is pivot table, input as ['sales data.csv'] output is sales data, input as ['invoice3001.xls.pdf'] output is invoice3001, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
