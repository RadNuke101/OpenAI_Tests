Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: **Input Column Data Summaries:**

1. Input Column 1: ['happy.jpg']
   - Summary: The input data in this column consists of a single file name 'happy.jpg'.

2. Input Column 2: ['pivot table.xls']
   - Summary: The input data in this column consists of a single file name 'pivot table.xls'.

3. Input Column 3: ['sales data.csv']
   - Summary: The input data in this column consists of a single file name 'sales data.csv'.

4. Input Column 4: ['invoice3001.xls.pdf']
   - Summary: The input data in this column consists of a single file name 'invoice3001.xls.pdf'.

**Output Column Data Summary:**

1. Output Column: [happy, pivot table, sales data, invoice3001]
   - Summary: The output data in this column represents the extracted file names from the input data. Each output corresponds to the main content of the input file name, such as 'happy', 'pivot table', 'sales data', and 'invoice3001'.

**Relationship Summary:**

The output column contains the main content extracted from the input file names. The relationship between the input and output is that the output represents a simplified version of the input, focusing on the main content or purpose of the file names. This relationship allows for easier identification and categorization of the files based on their primary content., and input as ['happy.jpg'] output is happy, input as ['pivot table.xls'] output is pivot table, input as ['sales data.csv'] output is sales data, input as ['invoice3001.xls.pdf'] output is invoice3001, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.

    output = input_str.split('.')[0]
    
    return output

# Test cases
print(generated_function('happy.jpg'))  # Output: happy
print(generated_function('pivot table.xls'))  # Output: pivot table
print(generated_function('sales data.csv'))  # Output: sales data
print(generated_function('invoice3001.xls.pdf'))  # Output: invoice3001
print(generated_function("happy.jpg"))  ## Output: happy
print(generated_function("pivot table.xls"))  ## Output: pivot table
print(generated_function("sales data.csv"))  ## Output: sales data
print(generated_function("invoice3001.xls.pdf"))  ## Output: invoice3001
