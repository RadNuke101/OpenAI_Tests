Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Summary for Input Column Data:
The input column data consists of names of universities or educational institutions along with their locations. The locations include city, state, and country information.

Summary for Output Column Data:
The output column data consists of the locations of the universities or educational institutions mentioned in the input column data. It includes city, state, and country information.

Relationship between Input and Output:
The input column data provides the names of universities or educational institutions along with their locations, while the output column data specifically lists the locations of these institutions. The relationship between the input and output is that the output provides a more concise and standardized format for the locations mentioned in the input. The output column data helps to clearly identify the city, state, and country where each institution is located, making it easier to understand and compare the locations of different universities., and input as ['University of Pennsylvania', 'Phialdelphia, PA, USA'] output is Phialdelphia, PA, USA, input as ['UCLA', 'Los Angeles, CA'] output is Los Angeles, CA, USA, input as ['Cornell University', 'Ithaca, New York, USA'] output is Ithaca, NY, USA, input as ['Penn', 'Philadelphia, PA, USA'] output is Philadelphia, PA, USA, input as ['University of Maryland College Park', 'College Park, MD'] output is College Park, MD, USA, input as ['University of Michigan', 'Ann Arbor, MI, USA'] output is Ann Arbor, MI, USA, input as ['Columbia University', 'New York, NY, USA'] output is New York, NY, USA, input as ['NYU', 'New York, New York, USA'] output is New York, NY, USA, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.

    # Combine the name and location information in the desired format
    output = location
    return output
