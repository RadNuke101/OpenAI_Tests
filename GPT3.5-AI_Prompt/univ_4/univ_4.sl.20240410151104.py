Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Summary for Input Column 1 (Universities):
- The input column contains names of various universities such as University of Pennsylvania, UCLA, Cornell University, Penn, University of Maryland College Park, University of Michigan, Columbia University, and NYU.

Summary for Input Column 2 (Locations):
- The input column contains locations of the universities such as Philadelphia, PA, USA; Los Angeles, CA; Ithaca, New York, USA; Philadelphia, PA, USA; College Park, MD; Ann Arbor, MI, USA; New York, NY, USA; and New York, New York, USA.

Summary for Output Column (Locations):
- The output column contains the locations of the universities such as Philadelphia, PA, USA; Los Angeles, CA, USA; Ithaca, NY, USA; Philadelphia, PA, USA; College Park, MD, USA; Ann Arbor, MI, USA; New York, NY, USA; and New York, NY, USA.

Relationship between Input and Output:
- The input column consists of university names and their respective locations, while the output column consists of the specific locations of the universities. The output column provides a standardized format for the locations by including the state abbreviation and country (USA). The relationship between the input and output is that the output column refines and standardizes the location information provided in the input column., and input as ['University of Pennsylvania', 'Phialdelphia, PA, USA'] output is Phialdelphia, PA, USA, input as ['UCLA', 'Los Angeles, CA'] output is Los Angeles, CA, USA, input as ['Cornell University', 'Ithaca, New York, USA'] output is Ithaca, NY, USA, input as ['Penn', 'Philadelphia, PA, USA'] output is Philadelphia, PA, USA, input as ['University of Maryland College Park', 'College Park, MD'] output is College Park, MD, USA, input as ['University of Michigan', 'Ann Arbor, MI, USA'] output is Ann Arbor, MI, USA, input as ['Columbia University', 'New York, NY, USA'] output is New York, NY, USA, input as ['NYU', 'New York, New York, USA'] output is New York, NY, USA, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
