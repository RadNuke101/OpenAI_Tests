Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Summary for Input Column 1 (Qualitative Data):
The input column 1 contains names of various universities or educational institutions.

Summary for Input Column 2 (Qualitative Data):
The input column 2 contains locations associated with the universities or educational institutions mentioned in column 1.

Summary for Output Column (Qualitative Data):
The output column contains the specific city, state, and country associated with each university or educational institution mentioned in the input columns.

Relationship between Input and Output:
The input columns provide the names of universities or educational institutions along with their respective locations. The output column then presents a standardized format for the location information, including the city, state, and country. This relationship helps to organize and present the location data in a consistent manner, making it easier to understand and compare the locations of different universities., and input as ['University of Pennsylvania', 'Phialdelphia, PA, USA'] output is Phialdelphia, PA, USA, input as ['UCLA', 'Los Angeles, CA'] output is Los Angeles, CA, USA, input as ['Cornell University', 'Ithaca, New York, USA'] output is Ithaca, NY, USA, input as ['Penn', 'Philadelphia, PA, USA'] output is Philadelphia, PA, USA, input as ['University of Maryland College Park', 'College Park, MD'] output is College Park, MD, USA, input as ['University of Michigan', 'Ann Arbor, MI, USA'] output is Ann Arbor, MI, USA, input as ['Columbia University', 'New York, NY, USA'] output is New York, NY, USA, input as ['NYU', 'New York, New York, USA'] output is New York, NY, USA, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
