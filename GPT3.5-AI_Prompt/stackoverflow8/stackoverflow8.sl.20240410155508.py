Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Input Column Data Summary:
- The input column data consists of file paths in the format 'home/folder/filename'. The data appears to be related to file locations or directories.

Output Column Summary:
- The output column contains only the file names extracted from the input paths. It seems to be a transformation or extraction of specific information from the input data.

Relationship Summary:
- The relationship between the input and output columns is that the output column is derived from the file names present in the input paths. The output column represents a simplified version of the input data, focusing only on the file names themselves. This transformation suggests a process of extracting relevant information from the input paths., and input as ['home/Excel/Sheet1.xls'] output is Sheet1.xls, input as ['home/user/Sheet1.xls'] output is Sheet1.xls, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.

# Define the generated function
def generated_function(input_str):
    # Split the input string by '/' and extract the last element as the output
    output = input_str.split('/')[-1]
    
    return output

# Test cases
print(generated_function('home/Excel/Sheet1.xls'))  # Output: Sheet1.xls
print(generated_function('home/user/Sheet1.xls'))  # Output: Sheet1.xls
print(generated_function("home/Excel/Sheet1.xls"))  ## Output: Sheet1.xls
print(generated_function("home/user/Sheet1.xls"))  ## Output: Sheet1.xls
