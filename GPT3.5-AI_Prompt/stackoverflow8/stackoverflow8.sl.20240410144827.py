Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Input Column Data Summary:
- ['home/Excel/Sheet1.xls']: This input column data consists of a single string representing a file path with three components: 'home', 'Excel', and 'Sheet1.xls'.
- ['home/user/Sheet1.xls']: This input column data also consists of a single string representing a file path with three components: 'home', 'user', and 'Sheet1.xls'.

Output Column Summary:
- The output column data consists of the file names extracted from the input column data: 'Sheet1.xls' for both inputs.

Relationship Summary:
- The relationship between the input and output columns is that the output column only contains the file names extracted from the input column data. The file names are the last component of the file paths in the input column data. This relationship indicates that the output is derived from specific parts of the input data, specifically the file names., and input as ['home/Excel/Sheet1.xls'] output is Sheet1.xls, input as ['home/user/Sheet1.xls'] output is Sheet1.xls, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.

# Define the generated function
def generated_function(input_str):
    # Split the input string by '/' and extract the last element as the file name
    file_name = input_str.split('/')[-1]
    
    return file_name

# Test cases
print(generated_function('home/Excel/Sheet1.xls'))  # Output: Sheet1.xls
print(generated_function('home/user/Sheet1.xls'))   # Output: Sheet1.xls
print(generated_function("home/Excel/Sheet1.xls"))  ## Output: Sheet1.xls
print(generated_function("home/user/Sheet1.xls"))  ## Output: Sheet1.xls
