Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Input Column Data Summary:
- ['home/Excel/Sheet1.xls']: This input column data consists of a file path with three components - 'home', 'Excel', and 'Sheet1.xls'.
- ['home/user/Sheet1.xls']: This input column data also consists of a file path with three components - 'home', 'user', and 'Sheet1.xls'.

Output Column Data Summary:
- Sheet1.xls: This output column data consists of the file name 'Sheet1.xls' extracted from the input file paths.

Relationship Summary:
The relationship between the input and output columns is that the output column contains only the file name extracted from the input file paths. The input columns provide the full file paths, while the output column simplifies this information by only displaying the file name. This relationship indicates a transformation or extraction process where the unnecessary path information is removed to focus on the essential file name., and input as ['home/Excel/Sheet1.xls'] output is Sheet1.xls, input as ['home/user/Sheet1.xls'] output is Sheet1.xls, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.

# Define the generated function
def generated_function(input_str):
    # Split the input string by '/' and extract the last element as the output
    output = input_str.split('/')[-1]
    
    return output

# Test cases
print(generated_function('home/Excel/Sheet1.xls'))  # Output: Sheet1.xls
print(generated_function('home/user/Sheet1.xls'))  # Output: Sheet1.xls
print(generated_function("home/Excel/Sheet1.xls"))  ## Output: Sheet1.xls
print(generated_function("home/user/Sheet1.xls"))  ## Output: Sheet1.xls
