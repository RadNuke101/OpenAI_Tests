Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Summary for Input Column Data:
- The input column data consists of names of individuals, with titles included (e.g., Dr. Nancy, Dr. Andrew).
- Each name appears to be unique and does not follow a specific pattern in terms of length or structure.

Summary for Output Column Data:
- The output column data consists of titles (e.g., Dr. Nancy, Dr. Andrew) derived from the input names.
- The titles "Dr." are consistently added to the beginning of each name in the output column.

Relationship between Input and Output:
- The relationship between the input names and the output titles is that the title "Dr." is added to the beginning of each name in the output column.
- The output titles suggest a level of professionalism or expertise associated with each individual in the input column.
- The output titles serve to provide a sense of respect or authority to the individuals mentioned in the input column., and input as ['Nancy FreeHafer'] output is Dr. Nancy, input as ['Andrew Cencici'] output is Dr. Andrew, input as ['Jan Kotas'] output is Dr. Jan, input as ['Mariya Sergienko'] output is Dr. Mariya, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.

# Define the generated function
def generated_function(*args):
    output = []
    for name in args:
        # Split the input name into first name and last name
        first_name, last_name = name.split()
        # Add "Dr." to the beginning of the first name and combine with last name
        output.append("Dr. " + first_name)
    return output

# Test cases
generated_function('Nancy FreeHafer', 'Andrew Cencici', 'Jan Kotas', 'Mariya Sergienko')
print(generated_function("Nancy FreeHafer"))  ## Output: Dr. Nancy
print(generated_function("Andrew Cencici"))  ## Output: Dr. Andrew
print(generated_function("Jan Kotas"))  ## Output: Dr. Jan
print(generated_function("Mariya Sergienko"))  ## Output: Dr. Mariya
