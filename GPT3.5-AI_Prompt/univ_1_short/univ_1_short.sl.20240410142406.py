Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Summary for Input Column Data:
The input column data consists of the names of various universities along with their locations. Each entry includes the name of the university followed by the city and state (and sometimes country) where the university is located. The data is qualitative in nature, providing information about the universities and their respective locations.

Summary for Output Column Data:
The output column data consists of the names of universities along with their specific locations. Each entry includes the name of the university followed by the city, state, and sometimes country where the university is located. The output data is a combination of the input university names and their corresponding locations.

Relationship between Input and Output:
The input data provides the names of universities along with their locations, while the output data combines this information into a single entry for each university. The relationship between the input and output is that the output data is a consolidation of the input data, presenting the university name and location together in a single entry. The output data serves as a summary of the input data, providing a concise representation of each university and its location., and input as ['University of Pennsylvania', 'Phialdelphia, PA, USA'] output is University of Pennsylvania, Phialdelphia, PA, USA, input as ['Cornell University', 'Ithaca, New York, USA'] output is Cornell University, Ithaca, New York, USA, input as ['University of Maryland College Park', 'College Park, MD'] output is University of Maryland College Park, College Park, MD, input as ['University of Michigan', 'Ann Arbor, MI, USA'] output is University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA, input as ['Yale University', 'New Haven, CT, USA'] output is Yale University, New Haven, CT, USA, input as ['Columbia University', 'New York, NY, USA'] output is Columbia University, New York, NY, USA, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
