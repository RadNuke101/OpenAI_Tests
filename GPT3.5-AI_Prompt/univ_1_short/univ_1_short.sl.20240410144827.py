Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Summary for Input Column Data:
- The input column data consists of the names of various universities along with their locations.
- The universities mentioned are University of Pennsylvania, Cornell University, University of Maryland College Park, University of Michigan, Yale University, and Columbia University.
- The locations include cities such as Philadelphia, Ithaca, College Park, Ann Arbor, New Haven, and New York, along with their respective states and countries.

Summary for Output Column Data:
- The output column data consists of the names of universities along with their complete locations, including city, state, and country.
- The output provides a comprehensive description of each university's physical location.

Relationship between Input and Output:
- The input column data provides the names of universities and their locations, while the output column data combines this information to form a complete description of each university's location.
- The output column serves as a synthesis of the input data, presenting a clear and concise summary of each university's physical presence.
- By combining the input data with additional location details, the output column enhances the understanding of each university's geographical context., and input as ['University of Pennsylvania', 'Phialdelphia, PA, USA'] output is University of Pennsylvania, Phialdelphia, PA, USA, input as ['Cornell University', 'Ithaca, New York, USA'] output is Cornell University, Ithaca, New York, USA, input as ['University of Maryland College Park', 'College Park, MD'] output is University of Maryland College Park, College Park, MD, input as ['University of Michigan', 'Ann Arbor, MI, USA'] output is University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA, input as ['Yale University', 'New Haven, CT, USA'] output is Yale University, New Haven, CT, USA, input as ['Columbia University', 'New York, NY, USA'] output is Columbia University, New York, NY, USA, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
