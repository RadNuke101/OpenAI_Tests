Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Summary for Input Column Data:
- The input column data consists of the names of various universities along with their locations.
- Each entry in the input column data includes the name of a university followed by the city, state, and country where the university is located.

Summary for Output Column Data:
- The output column data combines the name of the university with its location information in a single string.
- Each entry in the output column data includes the name of a university followed by the city, state, and country where the university is located, all in one cohesive sentence.

Relationship between Input and Output:
- The input column data provides separate pieces of information (university name and location) that are combined in the output column data to create a complete description of each university.
- By merging the university name and location into a single string, the output column data simplifies the information and makes it easier to understand and reference., and input as ['University of Pennsylvania', 'Phialdelphia, PA, USA'] output is University of Pennsylvania, Phialdelphia, PA, USA, input as ['Cornell University', 'Ithaca, New York, USA'] output is Cornell University, Ithaca, New York, USA, input as ['University of Maryland College Park', 'College Park, MD'] output is University of Maryland College Park, College Park, MD, input as ['University of Michigan', 'Ann Arbor, MI, USA'] output is University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA, input as ['Yale University', 'New Haven, CT, USA'] output is Yale University, New Haven, CT, USA, input as ['Columbia University', 'New York, NY, USA'] output is Columbia University, New York, NY, USA, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
