Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Summary for input column data:
The input column data consists of the names of various universities along with their locations. Each entry includes the name of the university followed by the city, state, and country (if applicable) where the university is located.

Summary for output column data:
The output column data consists of the university name followed by the location information in a consistent format. Each entry includes the university name, city, state, and country (if applicable) where the university is located.

Relationship between input and output:
The input column data provides the names of universities along with their locations, while the output column data presents the same information in a standardized format. The relationship between the input and output is that the output column transforms the input data into a consistent and structured format, making it easier to read and understand the location of each university. The output column serves as a formatted representation of the input data, providing a clear and concise summary of each university's location., and input as ['University of Pennsylvania', 'Phialdelphia, PA, USA'] output is University of Pennsylvania, Phialdelphia, PA, USA, input as ['Cornell University', 'Ithaca, New York, USA'] output is Cornell University, Ithaca, New York, USA, input as ['University of Maryland College Park', 'College Park, MD'] output is University of Maryland College Park, College Park, MD, input as ['University of Michigan', 'Ann Arbor, MI, USA'] output is University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA, input as ['Yale University', 'New Haven, CT, USA'] output is Yale University, New Haven, CT, USA, input as ['Columbia University', 'New York, NY, USA'] output is Columbia University, New York, NY, USA, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
