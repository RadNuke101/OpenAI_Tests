Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Summary for Input Column 1: The first input column contains strings that represent different objects or concepts. These strings are a mix of alphanumeric characters and symbols.

Summary for Input Column 2: The second input column contains a single symbol ('x' or '-'). This symbol is used as a separator between different parts of the strings in the first input column.

Summary for Input Column 3: The third input column contains numerical values. These values are used in conjunction with the strings in the first input column to represent dimensions or quantities.

Summary for Output Column: The output column contains numerical values that are the result of calculations based on the input data. These values seem to be derived from the dimensions or quantities represented in the first and third input columns.

Relationship between Input and Output: The output values seem to be calculated based on the dimensions or quantities represented in the first and third input columns, with the symbol in the second input column serving as a separator. The specific calculation method is not explicitly stated, but it likely involves some form of mathematical operation or manipulation of the input data., and input as ['100x15x50', 'x', '2'] output is 7, input as ['cat-in-the-hat', '-', '3'] output is 11, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
