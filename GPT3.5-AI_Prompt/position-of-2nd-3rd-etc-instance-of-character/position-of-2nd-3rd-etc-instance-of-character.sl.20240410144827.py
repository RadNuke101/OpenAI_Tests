Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: Input Column 1 Summary: 
The first input column contains strings that represent different objects or concepts. These strings are a mix of alphanumeric characters and symbols, such as '100x15x50' and 'cat-in-the-hat'.

Input Column 2 Summary:
The second input column contains symbols, specifically the symbol 'x' and the hyphen '-'.

Input Column 3 Summary:
The third input column contains numerical values, such as '2' in the first example and '3' in the second example.

Output Column Summary:
The output column contains numerical values, such as '7' and '11'.

Relationship Summary:
The relationship between the input columns and the output column seems to involve some sort of calculation or transformation based on the values in the input columns. The presence of symbols like 'x' and '-' in the input columns suggests that they may be used as operators in a mathematical operation. The numerical values in the input columns may be used as operands in this operation. The output values seem to be the result of this operation. Further analysis would be needed to determine the exact relationship between the input and output columns., and input as ['100x15x50', 'x', '2'] output is 7, input as ['cat-in-the-hat', '-', '3'] output is 11, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
