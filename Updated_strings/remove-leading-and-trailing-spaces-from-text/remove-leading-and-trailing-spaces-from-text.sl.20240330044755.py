# Content: The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: remove spaces from the beginning and end of input, and given input as ['  The shawshank'] output is The shawshank, given input as ['The    godfather'] output is The godfather, given input as ['    pulp   fiction'] output is pulp fiction, , generate a python function that matches the input and output, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. Add the input, output, and prompt to the comment section of the generated python code. Incorporate exception handling with proper try catch blocks to handle all types of inputs. The code should be clean to run at a command prompt without any noncode
# Prompt: remove spaces from the beginning and end of input
# Input: ['  The shawshank'] 
# Output: The shawshank

        # Remove leading and trailing spaces
        output_str = input_str.strip()

# Test cases
print(remove_spaces(['  The shawshank']))  # Output: The shawshank
print(remove_spaces(['The    godfather']))  # Output: The godfather
print(remove_spaces(['    pulp   fiction']))  # Output: pulp fiction
