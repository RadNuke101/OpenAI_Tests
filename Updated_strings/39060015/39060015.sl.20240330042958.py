# Content: The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: delete everything enclosed by a pair of "/" , and given input as ['This is a line. /delete words in the area /keep this part'] output is This is a line. keep this part, given input as ['/delete words in the area /'] output is , , generate a python function that matches the input and output, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. Add the input, output, and prompt to the comment section of the generated python code. Incorporate exception handling with proper try catch blocks to handle all types of inputs. The code should be clean to run at a command prompt without any noncode
