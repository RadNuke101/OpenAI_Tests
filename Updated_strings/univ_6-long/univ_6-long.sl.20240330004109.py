# Content: The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: return the second input, but if it contains "New York", replace it with "NY". If the second input does not have "USA" in it, again return a comma followed by a space, and then "USA", and given input as ['University of Pennsylvania', 'Phialdelphia, PA, USA'] output is Phialdelphia, PA, USA, given input as ['UCLA', 'Los Angeles, CA'] output is Los Angeles, CA, USA, given input as ['Cornell University', 'Ithaca, New York, USA'] output is Ithaca, NY, USA, given input as ['Penn', 'Philadelphia, PA, USA'] output is Philadelphia, PA, USA, given input as ['University of Maryland College Park', 'College Park, MD'] output is College Park, MD, USA, given input as ['University of Michigan', 'Ann Arbor, MI, USA'] output is Ann Arbor, MI, USA, given input as ['UC Berkeley', 'Berkeley, CA'] output is Berkeley, CA, USA, given input as ['MIT', 'Cambridge, MA'] output is Cambridge, MA, USA, given input as ['Rice University', 'Houston, TX'] output is Houston, TX, USA, given input as ['Yale University', 'New Haven, CT, USA'] output is New Haven, CT, USA, given input as ['Columbia University', 'New York, NY, USA'] output is New York, NY, USA, given input as ['NYU', 'New York, New York, USA'] output is New York, NY, USA, given input as ['UC Berkeley', 'Berkeley, CA'] output is Berkeley, CA, USA, given input as ['UIUC', 'Urbana, IL'] output is Urbana, IL, USA, given input as ['Temple University', 'Philadelphia, PA'] output is Philadelphia, PA, USA, given input as ['Harvard University', 'Cambridge, MA, USA'] output is Cambridge, MA, USA, given input as ['University of Connecticut', 'Storrs, CT, USA'] output is Storrs, CT, USA, given input as ['Drexel University', 'Philadelphia, PA'] output is Philadelphia, PA, USA, given input as ['New Haven University', 'New Haven, CT, USA'] output is New Haven, CT, USA, given input as ['University of California, Santa Barbara', 'Santa Barbara, CA, USA'] output is Santa Barbara, CA, USA, , generate a python function that matches the input and output, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. Add the input, output, and prompt to the comment section of the generated python code. Incorporate exception handling with proper try catch blocks to handle all types of inputs. The code should be clean to run at a command prompt without any noncode
