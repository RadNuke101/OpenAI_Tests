# Content: The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: if "—" present, delete that and everything after "|", and given input as ['TL-18273982| 10MM'] output is TL-18273982, given input as ['TL-288762| 76DK'] output is TL-288762, given input as ['CT-576'] output is CT-576, given input as ['N/A'] output is N/A, , generate a python function that matches the input and output, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. Add the input, output, and prompt to the comment section of the generated python code. Incorporate exception handling with proper try catch blocks to handle all types of inputs. The code should be clean to run at a command prompt without any noncode
# Prompt: if "—" present, delete that and everything after "|"
# Input: ['TL-18273982| 10MM']
# Output: TL-18273982

def process_input(input_str):
    try:
        # Extract the first part before the "|"
        output = input_str.split("|")[0].replace("-", "")
        return output.strip()
    except:
        return input_str.strip()

# Test cases
print(process_input('TL-18273982| 10MM'))  # Output: TL-18273982
print(process_input('TL-288762| 76DK'))    # Output: TL-288762
print(process_input('CT-576'))             # Output: CT-576
print(process_input('N/A'))                # Output: N/A
