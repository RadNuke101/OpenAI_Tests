# Content: The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: if "that" is in the inputted phrase (first column), remove "that" from the phrase and return the updated phrases. if the inputted phrase is one word, return unedited phrase, and given input as ['thatensures'] output is ensures, given input as ['thatwill'] output is will, given input as ['thathave'] output is have, given input as ['knowthat'] output is know, given input as ['that'] output is that, given input as ['mouse'] output is mouse, given input as ['knowthat'] output is know, , generate a python function that matches the input and output, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. Add the input, output, and prompt to the comment section of the generated python code. Incorporate exception handling with proper try catch blocks to handle all types of inputs. The code should be clean to run at a command prompt without any noncode
# Prompt: if "that" is in the inputted phrase, remove "that" from the phrase and return the updated phrases. 
# If the inputted phrase is one word, return unedited phrase.
# Input: 'thatensures' => Output: 'ensures'
# Input: 'thatwill' => Output: 'will'
# Input: 'thathave' => Output: 'have'
# Input: 'knowthat' => Output: 'know'
# Input: 'that' => Output: 'that'
# Input: 'mouse' => Output: 'mouse'
# Input: 'knowthat' => Output: 'know'
