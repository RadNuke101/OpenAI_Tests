# Content: The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: return everything before the fifth occurance of "=" from the right of input, and given input as ['valentine day=1915=50==7.1=45'] output is valentine day, given input as ['movie blah=2blahblah, The=1914=54==7.9=17'] output is movie blah=2blahblah, The, , generate a python function that matches the input and output, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. Add the input, output, and prompt to the comment section of the generated python code. Incorporate exception handling with proper try catch blocks to handle all types of inputs. The code should be clean to run at a command prompt without any noncode
# Prompt: return everything before the fifth occurance of "=" from the right of input
# Input: 'valentine day=1915=50==7.1=45'
# Output: 'valentine day'

        result = parts[0]
        return result
