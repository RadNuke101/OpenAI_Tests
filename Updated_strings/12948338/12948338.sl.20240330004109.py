# Content: The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: return count of the phrase (second column) in expression (first column), and given input as ['An example string with _username in it RT _AwesomeUser says _username is awesome', 'username'] output is 2, given input as ['An example string with _username in it RT _AwesomeUser says _username is awesome', 'AwesomeUser'] output is 1, given input as ['An _example string with _example in it is awesome _example', 'example'] output is 3, , generate a python function that matches the input and output, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. Add the input, output, and prompt to the comment section of the generated python code. Incorporate exception handling with proper try catch blocks to handle all types of inputs. The code should be clean to run at a command prompt without any noncode
# Prompt: return count of the phrase (second column) in expression (first column)
# Input: 'An example string with _username in it RT _AwesomeUser says _username is awesome', 'username'
# Output: 2
# Input: 'An example string with _username in it RT _AwesomeUser says _username is awesome', 'AwesomeUser'
# Output: 1
# Input: 'An _example string with _example in it is awesome _example', 'example'
# Output: 3
