# Content: The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: return phrase containing three capitalized letters in the beginning, and given input as ['Tire Pressure ABC123873 Monitor'] output is ABC123873, given input as [' Oil Life ABC849999999021 gauge'] output is ABC849999999021, given input as [' Air conditioner GHF211 maintenance'] output is GHF211, , generate a python function that matches the input and output, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. Add the input, output, and prompt to the comment section of the generated python code. Incorporate exception handling with proper try catch blocks to handle all types of inputs. The code should be clean to run at a command prompt without any noncode
