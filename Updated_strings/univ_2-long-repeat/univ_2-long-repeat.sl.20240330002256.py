# Content: The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: return the first input, followed by a comma and space, and then the second input. If the second input does not have "USA" in it, again return a comma followed by a space, and then "USA", and given input as ['UC Berkeley', 'Berkeley, CA'] output is UC Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA, given input as ['University of Pennsylvania', 'Phialdelphia, PA, USA'] output is University of Pennsylvania, Phialdelphia, PA, USA, given input as ['UCLA', 'Los Angeles, CA'] output is UCLA, Los Angeles, CA, USA, given input as ['Cornell University', 'Ithaca, New York, USA'] output is Cornell University, Ithaca, New York, USA, given input as ['Penn', 'Philadelphia, PA, USA'] output is Penn, Philadelphia, PA, USA, given input as ['University of Michigan', 'Ann Arbor, MI, USA'] output is University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA, given input as ['UC Berkeley', 'Berkeley, CA'] output is UC Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA, given input as ['MIT', 'Cambridge, MA'] output is MIT, Cambridge, MA, USA, given input as ['University of Pennsylvania', 'Phialdelphia, PA, USA'] output is University of Pennsylvania, Phialdelphia, PA, USA, given input as ['UCLA', 'Los Angeles, CA'] output is UCLA, Los Angeles, CA, USA, given input as ['University of Maryland College Park', 'College Park, MD'] output is University of Maryland College Park, College Park, MD, USA, given input as ['University of Michigan', 'Ann Arbor, MI, USA'] output is University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA, given input as ['UC Berkeley', 'Berkeley, CA'] output is UC Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA, given input as ['MIT', 'Cambridge, MA'] output is MIT, Cambridge, MA, USA, given input as ['Rice University', 'Houston, TX'] output is Rice University, Houston, TX, USA, given input as ['Yale University', 'New Haven, CT, USA'] output is Yale University, New Haven, CT, USA, given input as ['Columbia University', 'New York, NY, USA'] output is Columbia University, New York, NY, USA, given input as ['NYU', 'New York, New York, USA'] output is NYU, New York, New York, USA, given input as ['Drexel University', 'Philadelphia, PA'] output is Drexel University, Philadelphia, PA, USA, given input as ['UC Berkeley', 'Berkeley, CA'] output is UC Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA, given input as ['UIUC', 'Urbana, IL'] output is UIUC, Urbana, IL, USA, given input as ['Temple University', 'Philadelphia, PA'] output is Temple University, Philadelphia, PA, USA, given input as ['Harvard University', 'Cambridge, MA, USA'] output is Harvard University, Cambridge, MA, USA, given input as ['University of Connecticut', 'Storrs, CT, USA'] output is University of Connecticut, Storrs, CT, USA, given input as ['Drexel University', 'Philadelphia, PA'] output is Drexel University, Philadelphia, PA, USA, given input as ['NYU', 'New York, New York, USA'] output is NYU, New York, New York, USA, given input as ['UIUC', 'Urbana, IL'] output is UIUC, Urbana, IL, USA, given input as ['New Haven University', 'New Haven, CT, USA'] output is New Haven University, New Haven, CT, USA, given input as ['University of California, Santa Barbara', 'Santa Barbara, CA, USA'] output is University of California, Santa Barbara, Santa Barbara, CA, USA, given input as ['University of Connecticut', 'Storrs, CT, USA'] output is University of Connecticut, Storrs, CT, USA, , generate a python function that matches the input and output, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. Add the input, output, and prompt to the comment section of the generated python code. Incorporate exception handling with proper try catch blocks to handle all types of inputs. The code should be clean to run at a command prompt without any noncode
