# Content: The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: return the sequence of 4 numbers (excluding spaces) from input, and given input as ['April 1 1799'] output is 1799, given input as ['April 11 1867'] output is 1867, given input as ['February 12 1806'] output is 1806, given input as ['February 21 1798'] output is 1798, given input as ['February 28 1844 as Delaware Township'] output is 1844, given input as ['February 5 1798'] output is 1798, given input as ['February 7 1892 Verona Township'] output is 1892, given input as ['February 9 1797'] output is 1797, given input as ['January 19 1748'] output is 1748, given input as ['July 10 1721 as Upper Penns Neck Township'] output is 1721, given input as ['March 15 1860'] output is 1860, given input as ['March 17 1870 <as Raritan Township>'] output is 1870, given input as ['March 17 1874'] output is 1874, given input as ['March 23 1864'] output is 1864, given input as ['March 5 1867'] output is 1867, given input as ['April 28th 1828'] output is 1828, , generate a python function that matches the input and output, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. Add the input, output, and prompt to the comment section of the generated python code. Incorporate exception handling with proper try catch blocks to handle all types of inputs. The code should be clean to run at a command prompt without any noncode
