# Content: The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: return everything after the space in the inputted expression, and given input as ['year= 2016'] output is 2016, given input as ['make= subaru'] output is subaru, given input as ['model= outback wagon'] output is outback wagon, given input as ['fuel economy= 25/33'] output is 25/33, , generate a python function that matches the input and output, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. Add the input, output, and prompt to the comment section of the generated python code. Incorporate exception handling with proper try catch blocks to handle all types of inputs. The code should be clean to run at a command prompt without any noncode
# Prompt: return everything after the space in the inputted expression

def extract_after_space(input_str):
    try:
        # Split the input string by space and return the second part
        return input_str.split(' ')[1]
    except IndexError:
        return "Invalid input"

# Test cases
print(extract_after_space('year= 2016'))  # Output: 2016
print(extract_after_space('make= subaru'))  # Output: subaru
print(extract_after_space('model= outback wagon'))  # Output: outback wagon
print(extract_after_space('fuel economy= 25/33'))  # Output: 25/33
