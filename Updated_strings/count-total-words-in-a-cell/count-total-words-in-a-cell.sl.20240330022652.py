# Content: The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: return the number of words in the inputted expression, and given input as ['humpty dumpty'] output is 2, given input as ['humpty dumpty sat on a wall,'] output is 6, given input as ['couldnt put humpty together again.'] output is 5, , generate a python function that matches the input and output, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. Add the input, output, and prompt to the comment section of the generated python code. Incorporate exception handling with proper try catch blocks to handle all types of inputs. The code should be clean to run at a command prompt without any noncode
# Prompt: return the number of words in the inputted expression
# Input: 'humpty dumpty' 
# Output: 2

# Input: 'humpty dumpty sat on a wall,' 
# Output: 6

# Input: 'couldnt put humpty together again.' 
# Output: 5

    try:
        words = input_str.split()

    except AttributeError:
        return "Invalid input. Please enter a string."

# Test cases
print(count_words('humpty dumpty'))  # Output: 2
print(count_words('humpty dumpty sat on a wall,'))  # Output: 6
print(count_words('couldnt put humpty together again.'))  # Output: 5
print(count_words(123))  # Output: Invalid input. Please enter a string.
