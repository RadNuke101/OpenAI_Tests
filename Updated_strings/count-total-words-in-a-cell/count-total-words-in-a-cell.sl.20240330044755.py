# Content: The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: return the number of words in the inputted expression, and given input as ['humpty dumpty'] output is 2, given input as ['humpty dumpty sat on a wall,'] output is 6, given input as ['couldnt put humpty together again.'] output is 5, , generate a python function that matches the input and output, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. Add the input, output, and prompt to the comment section of the generated python code. Incorporate exception handling with proper try catch blocks to handle all types of inputs. The code should be clean to run at a command prompt without any noncode
# Prompt: return the number of words in the inputted expression
# Input: 'humpty dumpty' Output: 2
# Input: 'humpty dumpty sat on a wall,' Output: 6
# Input: 'couldnt put humpty together again.' Output: 5

def count_words(input_str):
    try:
        # Split the input string by spaces and count the number of words
        word_count = len(input_str.split())
        return word_count
    except AttributeError:
        return "Invalid input. Please enter a valid string."

# Test cases
print(count_words('humpty dumpty'))  # Output: 2
print(count_words('humpty dumpty sat on a wall,'))  # Output: 6
print(count_words('couldnt put humpty together again.'))  # Output: 5
