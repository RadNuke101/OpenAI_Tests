Casler, given input as ['Annalisa Gregori'] output is Gregori, given input as ['Jenee Pannell'] output is Pannell, , generate a python function that matches the input and output, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. Add the input, output, and prompt to the comment section of the generated python code. Incorporate exception handling with proper try catch blocks to handle all types of inputs. The code should be clean to run at a command prompt without any noncode
