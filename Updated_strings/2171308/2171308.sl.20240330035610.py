# Content: The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: return first letter of first word, followed by a space, and then the second word, and given input as ['John Doe'] output is J Doe, given input as ['Mayur Naik'] output is M Naik, given input as ['Nimit Singh'] output is N Singh, , generate a python function that matches the input and output, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. Add the input, output, and prompt to the comment section of the generated python code. Incorporate exception handling with proper try catch blocks to handle all types of inputs. The code should be clean to run at a command prompt without any noncode
# Prompt: return first letter of first word, followed by a space, and then the second word
# Input: ['John Doe'] Output: J Doe
# Input: ['Mayur Naik'] Output: M Naik
# Input: ['Nimit Singh'] Output: N Singh
