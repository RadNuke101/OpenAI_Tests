# Content: The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: remove all instances of "<" and ">", and given input as ['This is a <string>, It should be <changed> to <a> number.'] output is This is a string, It should be changed to a number., given input as ['a < 4 and a > 0'] output is a  4 and a  0, , generate a python function that matches the input and output, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. Add the input, output, and prompt to the comment section of the generated python code. Incorporate exception handling with proper try catch blocks to handle all types of inputs. The code should be clean to run at a command prompt without any noncode
# Prompt: 
# Given input as 'This is a <string>, It should be <changed> to <a> number.' output is 'This is a string, It should be changed to a number.'
# Given input as 'a < 4 and a > 0' output is 'a  4 and a  0'
