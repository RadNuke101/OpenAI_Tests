# Content: The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: return first three numbers after the first space in input, and given input as ['+106 769-858-438'] output is 769, given input as ['+83 973-757-831'] output is 973, given input as ['+62 647-787-775'] output is 647, given input as ['+172 027-507-632'] output is 027, given input as ['+72 001-050-856'] output is 001, given input as ['+95 310-537-401'] output is 310, given input as ['+6 775-969-238'] output is 775, , generate a python function that matches the input and output, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. Add the input, output, and prompt to the comment section of the generated python code. Incorporate exception handling with proper try catch blocks to handle all types of inputs. The code should be clean to run at a command prompt without any noncode
