Given that the prompt is: return first input followed by a space, and then the second input, and given input as ['Launa', 'Withers'] output is Launa Withers, given input as ['Lakenya', 'Edison'] output is Lakenya Edison, given input as ['Brendan', 'Hage'] output is Brendan Hage, given input as ['Bradford', 'Lango'] output is Bradford Lango, given input as ['Rudolf', 'Akiyama'] output is Rudolf Akiyama, given input as ['Lara', 'Constable'] output is Lara Constable, given input as ['Madelaine', 'Ghoston'] output is Madelaine Ghoston, given input as ['Salley', 'Hornak'] output is Salley Hornak, given input as ['Micha', 'Junkin'] output is Micha Junkin, given input as ['Teddy', 'Bobo'] output is Teddy Bobo, given input as ['Coralee', 'Scalia'] output is Coralee Scalia, given input as ['Jeff', 'Quashie'] output is Jeff Quashie, given input as ['Vena', 'Babiarz'] output is Vena Babiarz, given input as ['Karrie', 'Lain'] output is Karrie Lain, given input as ['Tobias', 'Dermody'] output is Tobias Dermody, given input as ['Celsa', 'Hopkins'] output is Celsa Hopkins, given input as ['Kimberley', 'Halpern'] output is Kimberley Halpern, given input as ['Phillip', 'Rowden'] output is Phillip Rowden, given input as ['Elias', 'Neil'] output is Elias Neil, given input as ['Lashanda', 'Cortes'] output is Lashanda Cortes, given input as ['Mackenzie', 'Spell'] output is Mackenzie Spell, given input as ['Kathlyn', 'Eccleston'] output is Kathlyn Eccleston, given input as ['Georgina', 'Brescia'] output is Georgina Brescia, given input as ['Beata', 'Miah'] output is Beata Miah, given input as ['Desiree', 'Seamons'] output is Desiree Seamons, given input as ['Jeanice', 'Soderstrom'] output is Jeanice Soderstrom, given input as ['Mariel', 'Jurgens'] output is Mariel Jurgens, given input as ['Alida', 'Bogle'] output is Alida Bogle, given input as ['Jacqualine', 'Olague'] output is Jacqualine Olague, given input as ['Joaquin', 'Clasen'] output is Joaquin Clasen, given input as ['Samuel', 'Richert'] output is Samuel Richert, given input as ['Malissa', 'Marcus'] output is Malissa Marcus, given input as ['Alaina', 'Partida'] output is Alaina Partida, given input as ['Trinidad', 'Mulloy'] output is Trinidad Mulloy, given input as ['Carlene', 'Garrard'] output is Carlene Garrard, given input as ['Melodi', 'Chism'] output is Melodi Chism, given input as ['Bess', 'Chilcott'] output is Bess Chilcott, given input as ['Chong', 'Aylward'] output is Chong Aylward, given input as ['Jani', 'Ramthun'] output is Jani Ramthun, given input as ['Jacquiline', 'Heintz'] output is Jacquiline Heintz, given input as ['Hayley', 'Marquess'] output is Hayley Marquess, given input as ['Andria', 'Spagnoli'] output is Andria Spagnoli, given input as ['Irwin', 'Covelli'] output is Irwin Covelli, given input as ['Gertude', 'Montiel'] output is Gertude Montiel, given input as ['Stefany', 'Reily'] output is Stefany Reily, given input as ['Rae', 'Mcgaughey'] output is Rae Mcgaughey, given input as ['Cruz', 'Latimore'] output is Cruz Latimore, given input as ['Maryann', 'Casler'] output is Maryann Casler, given input as ['Annalisa', 'Gregori'] output is Annalisa Gregori, given input as ['Jenee', 'Pannell'] output is Jenee Pannell, , generate a python function that matches the input and output, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. Add the input, output, and prompt to the comment section of the generated python code. Incorporate exception handling with proper try catch blocks to handle all types of inputs. The code should be clean to run at a command prompt without any noncode
