Given a list of information about individuals including their names, addresses, and locations, your task is to format this information into a more readable and organized format. The input consists of nested lists where each inner list contains the name, address, and location of a person. Your job is to transform this data into a list of strings where each string represents the information of one person in a structured manner. Each string should include the person's name, address, and location separated by line breaks. Make sure to include proper punctuation and spacing to ensure clarity and readability.
