Given a list of information about individuals, including their names, addresses, and locations, your task is to format this information into a readable format. Each entry in the list consists of the individual's name, street address, and city, state, and zip code. Your job is to create a prompt that will generate the formatted output for each individual, with each piece of information on a new line and separated by a forward slash. Make sure to include the appropriate punctuation and spacing to ensure clarity and readability.
