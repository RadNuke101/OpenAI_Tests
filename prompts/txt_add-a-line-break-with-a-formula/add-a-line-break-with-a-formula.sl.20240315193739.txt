Given a list of information about individuals including their names, addresses, and locations, your task is to format this data into a more readable and organized format. The input will be a list of lists, where each inner list contains the name, address, and location of a person. Your job is to transform this input into a list of strings, where each string represents the individual's information in a structured manner. Each string should include the person's name followed by a newline character, then their address, and finally their location. Make sure to include appropriate punctuation and spacing to ensure clarity and readability.
