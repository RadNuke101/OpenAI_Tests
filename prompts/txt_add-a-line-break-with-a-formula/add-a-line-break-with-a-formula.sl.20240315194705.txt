Given a list of information about individuals including their names, addresses, and locations, your task is to format this information into a more readable and organized format. The input consists of nested lists where each inner list contains the name, address, and location of a person. Your job is to transform this data into a list of strings where each string represents the information of a person formatted with line breaks and proper punctuation. The output should have the name followed by a line break, then the address on the next line, and finally the location on the last line. Make sure to include the appropriate punctuation and spacing to ensure clarity and readability.
