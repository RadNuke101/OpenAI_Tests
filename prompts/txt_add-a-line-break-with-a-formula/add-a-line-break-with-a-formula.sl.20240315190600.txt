Given a list of information about individuals, including their names, addresses, and locations, your task is to format this information in a more readable and organized way. The input will be a list of lists, where each inner list contains the name, address, and location of a person. Your job is to transform this input into a list of strings, where each string represents the information of one person formatted with line breaks and proper punctuation. The output should be a list of strings, with each string containing the name, address, and location of a person separated by line breaks and formatted correctly.
