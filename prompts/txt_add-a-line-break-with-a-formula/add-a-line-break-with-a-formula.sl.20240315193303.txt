Given a list of information about individuals including their names, addresses, and locations, your task is to format this information into a more readable and organized format. The input consists of nested lists where each inner list contains the name, street address, and city with state and zip code of an individual. Your job is to transform this data into a more presentable format by separating each piece of information with line breaks and forward slashes. 

For example, if the input is [['Traci Brown', '1301 Robinson Court', 'Saginaw, MI 48607'], ['Mary Hannan', '1195 Amethyst Drive', 'Lansing, MI 48933'], ['Linda Thomas', '2479 North Bend Road', 'Allen, KY 41601']], the output should be ['Traci Brown\n1301 Robinson Court\nSaginaw, MI 48607', 'Mary Hannan\n1195 Amethyst Drive\nLansing, MI 48933', 'Linda Thomas\n2479 North Bend Road\nAllen, KY 41601']. 

Please generate the formatted output based on the given input.
