Please provide a list of file paths. Each file path should be in the format of a list containing the directory structure leading to the file, followed by the file name. For example, [['home/Excel/Sheet1.xls'], ['home/user/Sheet1.xls']]. I will then extract and return a list of just the file names from the provided paths.
