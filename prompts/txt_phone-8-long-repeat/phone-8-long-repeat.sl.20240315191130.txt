Given a list of phone numbers with country codes and phone numbers, please extract the last three digits of each phone number. These three digits represent a unique identifier for each phone number. 

For example, if you are given the following list of phone numbers:
[['+106 769-858-438'], ['+83 973-757-831'], ['+62 647-787-775'], ['+172 027-507-632'], ['+72 001-050-856']]

Your task is to extract the last three digits from each phone number:
['438', '831', '775', '632', '856']

Please provide the extracted three-digit identifiers as the output.
