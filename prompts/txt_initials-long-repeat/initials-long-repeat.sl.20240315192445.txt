Given a list of full names, please generate a list of initials for each name. Ensure that the initials are in the format of the first letter of the first name followed by a period and then the first letter of the last name followed by a period. If the last name consists of multiple words, consider only the first word for the initials. Provide the list of initials in the same order as the corresponding full names.
