Given a list of full names, your task is to generate a list of initials for each name. The initials should consist of the first letter of the first name followed by a period, and the first letter of the last name followed by a period. Ensure that the initials are in uppercase and separated by a period. Provide the list of initials for each name in the same order as the input list.
