Given a list of plant names with varying levels of specificity, such as [['Polygonum amphibium'], ['Hippuris vulgaris'], ['Lysimachia vulgaris'], ['Juncus bulbosus ssp. bulbosus'], ['Lycopus europaeus ssp. europaeus'], ['Nymphaea alba']], can you provide a revised list where each plant name is simplified to its genus level? For example, 'Polygonum amphibium' should be changed to 'Polygonum'.
