Given a list of plant names with varying levels of specificity, your task is to extract the genus name for each plant. For example, from the input [['Polygonum amphibium']], you should output 'Polygonum'. Make sure to handle cases where the genus name is already provided (e.g. 'Juncus bulbosus ssp. bulbosus'). Your final output should be a list of genus names corresponding to the input list of plant names.
