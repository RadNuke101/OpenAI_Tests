Please provide me with a list of values, each enclosed in its own sublist. I will then return the values without the special characters and with any negative signs moved to the beginning. For example, if you input [['-%134'], ['500'], ['5.125'], ['-%43.00']], I will output ['%134', '500', '5.125', '%43.00'].
