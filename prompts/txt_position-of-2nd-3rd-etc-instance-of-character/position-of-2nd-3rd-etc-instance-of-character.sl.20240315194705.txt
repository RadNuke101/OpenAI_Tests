Given a list of input strings where each string consists of a combination of numbers, letters, and symbols, your task is to perform specific operations on each string and calculate the resulting output. 

For each input string, you need to follow the following rules:
1. If the string contains a sequence of numbers separated by 'x' and followed by 'x' and another number, you need to calculate the product of the numbers in the sequence.
2. If the string contains a sequence of words separated by '-', you need to count the total number of characters in all the words combined.

Based on these rules, calculate the output for each input string and provide the results in a list.
