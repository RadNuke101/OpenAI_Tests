Given a list of input strings where each string consists of a combination of numbers, letters, and symbols, your task is to perform specific operations on each string and calculate the resulting output. 

For each input string, follow these steps:
1. If the string contains the characters 'x' and a number, calculate the product of the numbers on either side of 'x'.
2. If the string contains the character '-', split the string by '-' and calculate the difference between the two resulting numbers.
3. If the string contains a number and a symbol, perform the corresponding operation.

After performing the operations on each input string, provide the resulting numbers as output. 

For example, given the input [['100x15x50', 'x', '2'], ['cat-in-the-hat', '-', '3']], the output should be ['7', '11'].
