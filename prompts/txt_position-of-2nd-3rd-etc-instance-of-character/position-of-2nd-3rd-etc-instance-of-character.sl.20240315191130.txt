Given a list of items with dimensions and quantities, calculate the total number of items based on the dimensions and quantities provided. For example, for the item '100x15x50' with a quantity of 2, the total number of items would be 7. Another example is the item 'cat-in-the-hat' with a quantity of 3, resulting in a total of 11 items. Calculate the total number of items for each item in the list and provide the results.
