You have a list of names in the format [['First Name', 'Last Name'], ['First Name', 'Last Name'], ...]. Your task is to rearrange each pair of names to have the last name first, followed by the first name. For example, ['Launa', 'Withers'] should be changed to 'Withers Launa'. Provide the updated list of names in the same format, with the last name first followed by the first name.
