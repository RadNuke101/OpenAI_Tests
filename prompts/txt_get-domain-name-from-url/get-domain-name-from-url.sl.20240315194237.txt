Please correct the URLs in the following list by removing the extra path elements after the domain name:

1. 'https=//abc.com/def'
2. 'http=//www.abc.com/def/cef'
3. 'http=//chandoo.org/wp/def-def'

After correcting the URLs, the list should look like this:

1. 'https=//abc.com/'
2. 'http=//www.abc.com'
3. 'http=//chandoo.org/'

Please make the necessary adjustments to ensure that each URL only includes the domain name without any additional path elements.
