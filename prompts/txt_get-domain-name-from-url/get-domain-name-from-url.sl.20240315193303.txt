You have been given a list of URLs with varying paths. Your task is to extract the domain name from each URL and remove the path, resulting in a list of simplified URLs. Each simplified URL should consist of the protocol (https or http) followed by the domain name. 

For example, given the input [['https=//abc.com/def'], ['http=//www.abc.com/def/cef'], ['http=//chandoo.org/wp/def-def']], your task is to simplify each URL by extracting the domain name and removing the path. 

Provide the simplified URLs in the format ['https=//abc.com/', 'http=//www.abc.com', 'http=//chandoo.org/'].
