Given a list of universities and their locations in a nested list format, your task is to convert this information into a more readable format. The input consists of university names and their corresponding locations, with some locations missing the country information. Your job is to ensure that each university's name is followed by its complete location, including the city, state, and country (if available). 

Write a function that takes the input as [['University of Pennsylvania', 'Phialdelphia, PA, USA'], ['UCLA', 'Los Angeles, CA'], ['Cornell University', 'Ithaca, New York, USA'], ['Penn', 'Philadelphia, PA, USA'], ['University of Maryland College Park', 'College Park, MD'], ['University of Michigan', 'Ann Arbor, MI, USA']], and returns the output as ['University of Pennsylvania, Phialdelphia, PA, USA', 'UCLA, Los Angeles, CA, USA', 'Cornell University, Ithaca, New York, USA', 'Penn, Philadelphia, PA, USA', 'University of Maryland College Park, College Park, MD, USA', 'University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA']. 

Make sure to include the country information for each location, and handle cases where the country information is missing by assuming it is part of the location. Your function should return a list of formatted strings with the university name followed by the complete location.
