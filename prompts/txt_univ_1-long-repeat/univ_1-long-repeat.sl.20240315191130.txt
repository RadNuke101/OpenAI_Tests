You have been given a list of university names and their corresponding locations. Your task is to organize this information into a formatted list that includes both the university name and its location. The list should maintain the order of the original input. 

Write a program that takes the input list and returns a new list where each element consists of the university name followed by a comma and then the location. Make sure to handle any duplicate entries by including them in the output list as well.
