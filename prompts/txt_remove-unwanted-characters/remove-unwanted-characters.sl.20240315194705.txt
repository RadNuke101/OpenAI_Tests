Given a list of pairs where the first element is a string and the second element is a character, rearrange the characters in each string to create new strings. The new strings should be formed by removing the character specified in the pair from the original string. Once you have rearranged the characters in each string, sort the new strings in lexicographical order and provide the resulting list.
