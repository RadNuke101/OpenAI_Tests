Given a list of pairs where each pair consists of a string and a single character, rearrange the characters in each string to create new strings. The new strings should be formed by removing the character specified in the pair from the original string. Once you have rearranged the characters in each string, arrange the resulting strings in lexicographically increasing order. 

For example, if the input is [['zx66448', 'z'], ['zx66448', 'x'], ['zx66448', '6'], ['zx66448', '4'], ['zx66448', '8']], the output should be ['x66448', 'z66448', 'zx448', 'zx668', 'zx6644'].
