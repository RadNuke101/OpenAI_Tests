Given a list of pairs where the first element is a string and the second element is a character, rearrange the characters in each string to generate a new list of strings. The new strings should be formed by removing the character specified in the pair from the original string. The output should be a list of strings in which each character specified in the pairs has been removed from the corresponding string.
