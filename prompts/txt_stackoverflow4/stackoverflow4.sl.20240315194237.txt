Please convert the following color codes into a more readable format by removing the symbols and commas:

Input: [['R/V<208,0,32>'], ['R/S<184,28,16>'], ['R/B<255,88,80>']]

Output: ['R/V 208 0 32', 'R/S 184 28 16', 'R/B 255 88 80']

Can you please provide the color codes in a clearer format by removing the symbols and commas?
