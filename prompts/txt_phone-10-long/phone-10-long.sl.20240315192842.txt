You have been given a list of phone numbers in a specific format. Each phone number is represented as a list containing a string with the phone number in a certain format. Your task is to convert these phone numbers into a more readable format by adding parentheses around the area code and separating the phone number into groups with dashes. 

Write a function that takes the list of phone numbers as input and returns a new list with the phone numbers formatted as follows: each phone number should have the area code enclosed in parentheses and the phone number split into groups with dashes. 

For example, the phone number '+106 769-858-438' should be formatted as '+106 (769) 858-438'. 

Provide the function with the necessary input and test if it returns the correct output.
