You have been given a list of phone numbers in a specific format. Each phone number is represented as a list containing a string with the country code, area code, and phone number separated by spaces and dashes. Your task is to format these phone numbers in a more readable way by adding parentheses around the area code and hyphens between the different parts of the phone number. 

Write a function that takes the input list of phone numbers and returns a new list where each phone number is formatted as follows: country code followed by the area code in parentheses and the phone number separated by hyphens. 

For example, the phone number '+106 769-858-438' should be formatted as '+106 (769) 858-438'.
