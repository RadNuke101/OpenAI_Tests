You have been given a list of phone numbers in a specific format. Each phone number is represented as a list containing a string with the country code, area code, and phone number separated by spaces and hyphens. Your task is to convert these phone numbers into a more readable format by adding parentheses around the area code and changing the hyphens to spaces. 

Write a function that takes the list of phone numbers as input and returns a new list where each phone number is formatted as follows: "+CountryCode (AreaCode) PhoneNumber". 

For example, the phone number '+106 769-858-438' should be formatted as '+106 (769) 858 438'. 

Write a function that performs this formatting and returns the updated list of phone numbers.
