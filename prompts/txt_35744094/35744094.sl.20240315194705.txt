Given a list of website URLs that include information about different products, can you identify the product names associated with each URL? Your task is to extract the product names from the URLs provided and return them in a list. For example, from the URL 'http=//www.apple.com/uk/mac', you should identify the product name 'mac'. Apply the same process to the other URLs in the list and provide a list of the product names found.
