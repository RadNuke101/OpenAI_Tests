Please provide me with a list of phone numbers in the format [['+XXX XXX-XXX-XXX'], ...]. I will extract the last three digits from each phone number and return them in a list. 

For example, given the input [['+106 769-858-438'], ['+83 973-757-831'], ['+62 647-787-775']], I will return the output ['438', '831', '775'].
