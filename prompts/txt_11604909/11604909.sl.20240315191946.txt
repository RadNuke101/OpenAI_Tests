Given a list of software versions in various formats, can you extract the version numbers from each entry and provide them in a standardized format? For example, from the input [['AIX 5.1']], you should output '5.1'. Please provide the version numbers for the following software entries: [['AIX 5.1'], ['VMware ESX Server 3.5.0 build-110268'], ['Linux Linux 2.6 Linux'], ['Red Hat Enterprise AS 4 <2.6-78.0.13.ELlargesmp>'], ['Microsoft <R> Windows <R> 2000 Advanced Server 1.0'], ['Microsoft Windows XP Win2008R2 6.1.7601']].
