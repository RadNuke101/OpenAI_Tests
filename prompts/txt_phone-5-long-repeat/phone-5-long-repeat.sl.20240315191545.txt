You have been given a list of phone numbers, each starting with a country code. Your task is to extract the country codes from each phone number and create a new list containing only the country codes. The country code is the set of numbers at the beginning of each phone number.

For example, if you are given the phone numbers ['+106 769-858-438', '+83 973-757-831', '+62 647-787-775'], you should extract the country codes '106', '83', and '62' respectively.

Now, create a function that takes a list of phone numbers as input and returns a new list containing only the country codes extracted from each phone number.
