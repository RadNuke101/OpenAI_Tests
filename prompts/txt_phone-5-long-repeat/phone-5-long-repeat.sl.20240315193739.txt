You have been given a list of phone numbers, each starting with a country code. Your task is to extract the country codes from each phone number and create a new list containing only the country codes. The country code is the set of digits that appear before the first space in each phone number.

For example, from the phone number '+106 769-858-438', the country code is '106'.

Now, write a function that takes the list of phone numbers as input and returns a new list containing only the extracted country codes.
