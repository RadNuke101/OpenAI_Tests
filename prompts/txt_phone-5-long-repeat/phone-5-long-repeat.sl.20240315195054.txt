You have been given a list of phone numbers with country codes. Your task is to extract the country codes from each phone number and create a new list containing only the country codes. The country code is the set of digits at the beginning of each phone number. 

For example, from the phone number '+106 769-858-438', the country code is '106'. 

Create a function that takes the list of phone numbers as input and returns a new list containing only the country codes. 

Input: [['+106 769-858-438'], ['+83 973-757-831'], ['+62 647-787-775'], ...]

Output: ['106', '83', '62', ...]

Implement this function to solve the task.
