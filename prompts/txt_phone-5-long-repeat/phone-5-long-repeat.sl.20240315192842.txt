Given a list of phone numbers with country codes, your task is to extract the country codes from each phone number. The country code is the first part of the phone number, which is separated by a space and followed by the rest of the number. 

For example, from the phone number '+106 769-858-438', the country code is '106'. 

Please provide a function that takes a list of phone numbers and returns a list of the corresponding country codes extracted from each phone number. 

For the given input list of phone numbers, the expected output list of country codes is ['106', '106', '106', '83', '83', '83', ...].
