Given a list of phone numbers in a specific format, your task is to convert each phone number into a more readable format by replacing the hyphens with periods. The input consists of nested lists, each containing a single phone number in the format '###-###-###'. Your output should be a list of phone numbers with the hyphens replaced by periods, resulting in a format like '###.###.###'. 

For example, if the input is [['123-456-789'], ['987-654-321']], the output should be ['123.456.789', '987.654.321']. 

Please convert the phone numbers in the given format to the desired format and provide the output accordingly.
