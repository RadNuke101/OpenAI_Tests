Given a list of phone numbers in a specific format, your task is to convert each phone number into a more readable format by replacing the hyphens with periods. The input consists of nested lists, with each inner list containing a single phone number in the format '###-###-###'. Your job is to transform each phone number into the format '###.###.###' and return a new list with the updated phone numbers.
