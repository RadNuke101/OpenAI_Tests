Given a list of phone numbers in a specific format, your task is to convert each phone number to a more readable format by replacing the hyphens with periods. The input consists of nested lists, where each inner list contains a single phone number. The output should be a list of phone numbers with hyphens replaced by periods. 

For example, if the input is [['938-242-504'], ['308-916-545']], the output should be ['938.242.504', '308.916.545']. 

Please provide the converted phone numbers in the specified format.
