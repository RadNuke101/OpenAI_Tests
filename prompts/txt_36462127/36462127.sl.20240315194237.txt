Given a list of strings where each string represents a hierarchical structure, can you identify the last element in the deepest level of each structure? 

For example, if the input is [['ABCDE/FGHI/JKL/MNOPQR'], ['A/ABCDE/FGHI/JKL']], can you determine the last element in the deepest level of each structure and provide them as output?
