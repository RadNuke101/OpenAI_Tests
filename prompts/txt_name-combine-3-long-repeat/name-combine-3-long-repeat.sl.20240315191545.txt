You have a list of full names, with each name consisting of a first name and a last name. Your task is to format these names in a specific way - by taking the first letter of the first name and combining it with the last name. For example, for the name 'Launa Withers', you would format it as 'L. Withers'. Apply this formatting to all the names in the list and provide the updated list as the output.
