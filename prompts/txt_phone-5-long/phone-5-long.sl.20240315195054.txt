Given a list of phone numbers in the format [['+XXX XXX-XXX-XXX'], ['+XXX XXX-XXX-XXX'], ...], can you extract the country codes from each phone number and return them as a list of strings?

For example, if the input is [['+106 769-858-438'], ['+83 973-757-831'], ['+62 647-787-775']], the output should be ['106', '83', '62'].
