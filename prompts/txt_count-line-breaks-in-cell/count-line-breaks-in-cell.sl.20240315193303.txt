Please provide a list of strings where each string represents a path separated by slashes. Each path consists of one or more elements. For each path provided, I will assign a number based on the position of the element in the path. The numbers will correspond to the elements in the path, starting from 1. Let's begin:

Input: [['one'], ['one/ntwo'], ['one/ntwo/nthree']]
Output: ['1', '2', '3']

Please provide the paths for which you would like me to assign numbers.
