Please provide me with a list of strings representing a hierarchical structure. Each string should indicate a level in the hierarchy, separated by slashes. For example, 'one' represents the first level, 'one/ntwo' represents the second level under 'one', and 'one/ntwo/nthree' represents the third level under 'one/ntwo'. 

Based on the input you provide, I will assign a numerical value to each level in the hierarchy. For instance, 'one' will be assigned the value '1', 'one/ntwo' will be assigned the value '2', and 'one/ntwo/nthree' will be assigned the value '3'. 

Please provide the list of hierarchical strings, and I will assign the corresponding numerical values to each level.
