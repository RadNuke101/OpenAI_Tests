Please provide a list of paths where each path consists of a series of elements separated by slashes. For each path, I will assign a numerical value based on the position of the element in the path. The first element will be assigned the value '1', the second element '2', and so on. After processing all the paths, I will provide you with a list of numerical values corresponding to each element in the paths.
