Please provide a list of strings where each string represents a path with multiple levels separated by slashes. I will then assign a numerical value to each level in the path based on its position. For example, if you provide [['one'], ['one/ntwo'], ['one/ntwo/nthree']], I will return ['1', '2', '3'] where 'one' corresponds to '1', 'ntwo' corresponds to '2', and 'nthree' corresponds to '3'. This way, you can easily map the levels of the paths to their respective numerical values.
