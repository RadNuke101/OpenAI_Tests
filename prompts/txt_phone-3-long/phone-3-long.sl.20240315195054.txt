Given a list of phone numbers in a specific format, your task is to convert each phone number into a more readable and standardized format. The input consists of phone numbers in the format [['xxx-xxx-xxx'], ['xxx-xxx-xxx'], ...]. Your goal is to transform each phone number into the format '(xxx) xxx-xxx' and return a list of these formatted phone numbers.

For example, if the input is [['123-456-789'], ['987-654-321']], the output should be ['(123) 456-789', '(987) 654-321']. 

Now, please write a function that takes the input as described above and returns the formatted phone numbers as output.
