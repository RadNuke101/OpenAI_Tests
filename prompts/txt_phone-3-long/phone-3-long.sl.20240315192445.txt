You have been given a list of phone numbers in a specific format. Each phone number is represented as a list containing a string of digits. Your task is to convert these phone numbers into a more readable format by adding parentheses and hyphens in the appropriate places. 

Write a function that takes the list of phone numbers as input and returns a new list where each phone number is formatted as follows: (XXX) XXX-XXXX. 

For example, given the input [['938-242-504'], ['308-916-545']], the function should return ['(938) 242-504', '(308) 916-545']. 

Make sure to handle the conversion of each phone number correctly by adding the parentheses around the area code and the hyphen between the next sets of digits.
