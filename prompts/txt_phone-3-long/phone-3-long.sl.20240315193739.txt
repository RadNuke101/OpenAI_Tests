Please provide me with a list of phone numbers in the format [['xxx-xxx-xxx'], ['xxx-xxx-xxx'], ...]. I will convert these phone numbers into a more readable format with the area code enclosed in parentheses and the numbers separated by hyphens. For example, [['123-456-789'], ['987-654-321']] will be transformed into ['(123) 456-789', '(987) 654-321']. Let me know when you're ready to proceed.
