Given a list of full names consisting of a first name and a last name, your task is to generate a new list with the first initial of the first name followed by a period and then the last name. For example, if the input is [['Nancy', 'FreeHafer'], ['Andrew', 'Cencici'], ['Jan', 'Kotas'], ['Mariya', 'Sergienko']], the output should be ['Nancy F.', 'Andrew C.', 'Jan K.', 'Mariya S.']. Remember to include the period after the first initial and a space between the initial and the last name.
