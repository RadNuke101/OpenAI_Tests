Given a list of phone numbers in a specific format, your task is to convert each phone number into a more readable format. The input consists of phone numbers in the format [['xxx-xxx-xxx'], ['xxx-xxx-xxx'], ...]. Your goal is to transform each phone number into the format '(xxx) xxx-xxx'. 

To achieve this, you need to iterate through each phone number in the input list and apply the following transformation: replace the hyphens with a space after the third digit and enclose the first three digits in parentheses. 

Once you have processed all the phone numbers in the input list, you will obtain the desired output list of phone numbers in the format ['(xxx) xxx-xxx', '(xxx) xxx-xxx', ...].
