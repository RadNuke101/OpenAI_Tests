For each phone number in the list of lists provided, format the phone number into a specific pattern. The input consists of phone numbers in a list of lists format. Each inner list contains a single phone number in a string format. Your task is to convert these phone numbers into a more readable format by adding parentheses around the area code and hyphens between the subsequent number groups. Return the formatted phone numbers in a list.

For example, if the input is [['123-456-789']], the output should be ['(123) 456-789']. Apply this formatting to all the phone numbers in the input list and return the formatted phone numbers.
