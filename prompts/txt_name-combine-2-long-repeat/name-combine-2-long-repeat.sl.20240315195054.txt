You have a list of full names, with each name consisting of a first name and a last name. Your task is to format these names by abbreviating the last name to just the first letter followed by a period. For example, "Nancy FreeHafer" should be formatted as "Nancy F.". Write a program that takes this list of names and outputs the formatted names according to this rule.
