Given a list of names, each representing a person, your task is to generate a list of titles for each person based on their first name. The titles should be in the format "Dr. [First Name]". For example, if the input is [['Launa Withers'], ['Launa Withers'], ['Launa Withers']], the output should be ['Dr. Launa', 'Dr. Launa', 'Dr. Launa']. Write a prompt that will guide you to generate the correct output based on the input provided.
