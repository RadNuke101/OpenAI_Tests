Given a list of names, each representing a person, your task is to generate a list of titles for each person. The titles should be in the format "Dr. [First Name]". For example, if the input is [['Launa Withers'], ['Launa Withers'], ['Launa Withers']], the output should be ['Dr. Launa', 'Dr. Launa', 'Dr. Launa']. Write a program that takes the list of names as input and outputs the corresponding titles with "Dr." followed by the first name of each person.
