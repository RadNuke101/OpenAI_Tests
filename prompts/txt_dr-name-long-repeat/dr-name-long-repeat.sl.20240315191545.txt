Given a list of names, each representing a person, your task is to generate a list of titles for each person based on their first name. The titles should follow the format "Dr. [First Name]". For example, if the input is [['John Doe'], ['Jane Smith']], the output should be ['Dr. John', 'Dr. Jane']. Write a program that can automate this process and provide the correct titles for each person in the input list.
