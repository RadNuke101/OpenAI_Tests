Given a list of phone numbers, each represented as a list of strings with the format '###-###-###', your task is to extract the area code from each phone number. The area code is the first three digits of the phone number. 

For example, from the phone number '938-242-504', the area code is '938'. 

Please generate a prompt that will return a list of all the area codes extracted from the input list of phone numbers.
