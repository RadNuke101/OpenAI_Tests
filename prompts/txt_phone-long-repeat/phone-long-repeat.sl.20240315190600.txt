Given a list of phone numbers, where each phone number is represented as a list of digits, your task is to extract the area code from each phone number. The area code is the first three digits of each phone number.

For example, from the phone number ['938-242-504'], the area code is '938'. 

Please write a function that takes a list of phone numbers and returns a list of the corresponding area codes.
