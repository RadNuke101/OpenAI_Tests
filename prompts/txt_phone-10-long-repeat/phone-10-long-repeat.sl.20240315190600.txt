Given a list of phone numbers in a specific format, your task is to format each phone number in a more readable way. The input consists of phone numbers with country codes, area codes, and phone numbers separated by hyphens. Your task is to convert each phone number into a format that includes parentheses around the area code and a space between the country code, area code, and phone number.
