Given a list of phone numbers in a specific format, your task is to format each phone number in a more readable way. The input consists of phone numbers with country codes, area codes, and the actual phone number separated by hyphens. Your task is to convert each phone number into a format where the country code is enclosed in parentheses, and the area code and phone number are separated by a space. 

For example, if the input is [['+106 769-858-438'], ['+83 973-757-831']], the expected output should be ['+106 (769) 858-438', '+83 (973) 757-831']. 

Please provide the formatted phone numbers as output.
