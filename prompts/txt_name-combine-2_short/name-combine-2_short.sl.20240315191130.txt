Given a list of full names in the format [['First Name', 'Last Name']], can you please generate a new list with the initials of the first name followed by the last name initial, separated by a period? For example, if the input is [['Nancy', 'FreeHafer']], the output should be ['Nancy F.']. Can you please provide the updated list with the initials formatted in this way for each name?
