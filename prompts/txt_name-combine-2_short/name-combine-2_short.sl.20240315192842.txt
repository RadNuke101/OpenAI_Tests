Given a list of full names in the format [['First Name', 'Last Name']], can you please provide a shortened version of each name by taking the first letter of the first name and adding a period after it, followed by the last name? For example, if the input is [['Nancy', 'FreeHafer']], the output should be 'Nancy F.'.
