Given a list of universities and their locations, please format the information in a grammatically correct manner. Each entry should consist of the university name followed by the city and state, with "USA" included if applicable. For example, if the input is [['University of Pennsylvania', 'Phialdelphia, PA, USA'], ['UCLA', 'Los Angeles, CA']], the output should be ['University of Pennsylvania, Phialdelphia, PA, USA', 'UCLA, Los Angeles, CA, USA'].
