Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: if inputted phrase has more than one word, return the first word, else return nothing, and input as ['The quick brown fox.'] output is The, input as ['quick brown fox.'] output is quick, input as ['fox'] output is , , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
