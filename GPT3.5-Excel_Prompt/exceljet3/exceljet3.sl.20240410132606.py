Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: return everything after the space in the inputted expression, and input as ['year= 2016'] output is 2016, input as ['make= subaru'] output is subaru, input as ['model= outback wagon'] output is outback wagon, input as ['fuel economy= 25/33'] output is 25/33, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.

# Define the generated function
def generated_function(input_str):
    # Split the input string by '=' and return the second part
    return input_str.split('= ')[1]

# Test cases
print(generated_function('year= 2016'))
print(generated_function('make= subaru'))
print(generated_function('model= outback wagon'))
print(generated_function('fuel economy= 25/33'))
print(generated_function("year= 2016"))  ## Output: 2016
print(generated_function("make= subaru"))  ## Output: subaru
print(generated_function("model= outback wagon"))  ## Output: outback wagon
print(generated_function("fuel economy= 25/33"))  ## Output: 25/33
