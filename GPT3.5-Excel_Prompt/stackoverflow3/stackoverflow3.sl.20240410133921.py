Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: return everything after the sequence of 4 numbers (excluding spaces) from input, and input as ['geb. 14 oct 1956 Westerkerk HRL'] output is Westerkerk HRL, input as ['geb. 14 oct 1956 '] output is , input as ['geb. 15 feb 1987 Westerkerk HRL'] output is Westerkerk HRL, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.

# Define the function

    result = []
    for arg in args:
        index = arg.find(' ')
        result.append(arg[index+1:].strip())
    return result

# Test cases
print(generated_function('geb. 14 oct 1956 Westerkerk HRL', 'geb. 14 oct 1956 ', 'geb. 15 feb 1987 Westerkerk HRL'))
print(generated_function("geb. 14 oct 1956 Westerkerk HRL"))  ## Output: Westerkerk HRL
print(generated_function("geb. 14 oct 1956 "))  ## Output: 
print(generated_function("geb. 15 feb 1987 Westerkerk HRL"))  ## Output: Westerkerk HRL
