'''
Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: return the first input, followed by a comma and space, and then the second input, and input as ['University of Pennsylvania', 'Phialdelphia, PA, USA'] output is University of Pennsylvania, Phialdelphia, PA, USA, input as ['Cornell University', 'Ithaca, New York, USA'] output is Cornell University, Ithaca, New York, USA, input as ['University of Maryland College Park', 'College Park, MD'] output is University of Maryland College Park, College Park, MD, input as ['University of Michigan', 'Ann Arbor, MI, USA'] output is University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA, input as ['Yale University', 'New Haven, CT, USA'] output is Yale University, New Haven, CT, USA, input as ['Columbia University', 'New York, NY, USA'] output is Columbia University, New York, NY, USA, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.

# Define the function to return the inputs separated by a comma and space
def generated_function(input1, input2):
    return input1 + ', ' + input2
print(generated_function("University of Pennsylvania", "Phialdelphia, PA, USA"))  ## Output: University of Pennsylvania, Phialdelphia, PA, USA
print(generated_function("Cornell University", "Ithaca, New York, USA"))  ## Output: Cornell University, Ithaca, New York, USA
print(generated_function("University of Maryland College Park", "College Park, MD"))  ## Output: University of Maryland College Park, College Park, MD
print(generated_function("University of Michigan", "Ann Arbor, MI, USA"))  ## Output: University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA
print(generated_function("Yale University", "New Haven, CT, USA"))  ## Output: Yale University, New Haven, CT, USA
print(generated_function("Columbia University", "New York, NY, USA"))  ## Output: Columbia University, New York, NY, USA
