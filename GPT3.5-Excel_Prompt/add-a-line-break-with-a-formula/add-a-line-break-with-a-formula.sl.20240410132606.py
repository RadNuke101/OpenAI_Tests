Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: add "/n" between the first and second inputted expression, and between the second and third inputted expression, and input as ['Traci Brown', '1301 Robinson Court', 'Saginaw, MI 48607'] output is Traci Brown/n1301 Robinson Court/nSaginaw, MI 48607, input as ['Mary Hannan', '1195 Amethyst Drive', 'Lansing, MI 48933'] output is Mary Hannan/n1195 Amethyst Drive/nLansing, MI 48933, input as ['Linda Thomas', '2479 North Bend Road', 'Allen, KY 41601'] output is Linda Thomas/n2479 North Bend Road/nAllen, KY 41601, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
