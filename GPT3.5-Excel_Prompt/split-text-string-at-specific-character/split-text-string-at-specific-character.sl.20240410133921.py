Prompt:
The prompt describes the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Given that the prompt is: in the first input, return everything between the nth (n = second input) occurance of the period and the prior occurance of the period, and input as ['011016_assignment.xlsx', '1'] output is 011016, input as ['011016_assignment.xlsx', '2'] output is assignment.xlsx, input as ['030116_cost.xlsx', '1'] output is 030116, input as ['030116_cost.xlsx', '2'] output is cost.xlsx, , generate a python function that matches the given input and output above, treating the input and output as strings, not lists. If the input has multiple list elements, that means there are separate inputs that should be passed as separate arguments to the python function. Include the above input in test cases. Do not include the output of the test code in the python program. The generated python code should have only executable statements and comments. The function should return the output, not print it. Do not include assert statements. Name the generated python function as generated_function. Make sure to generate a python function as defined above.
